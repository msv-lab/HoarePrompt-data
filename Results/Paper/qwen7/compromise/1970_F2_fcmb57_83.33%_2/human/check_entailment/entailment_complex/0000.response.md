Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to update the position of a player or ball by moving it in the direction specified by the movement string (`b`).
   - The function correctly takes the current position `(x, y)` and adds the corresponding movement vector `(dx, dy)` to it.
   - The function returns the new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
   - The function does not have any issues with its logic or implementation.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly initializes the field, players, and goals based on the input.
   - The program processes each action in the game and updates the positions and states of players and the Quaffle accordingly.
   - The program handles player eliminations, scoring, and updates the score based on the actions.
   - The program prints the appropriate events and the final score in the correct format.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem statement, such as the dimensions of the field, the presence of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - The program ensures that the Quaffle is moved to the middle of the field when a goal is scored and that the correct team is credited with the point.
   - The program correctly handles player eliminations and prints them in the required format.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the events in the correct order and format, including the final score.
   - The program ensures that multiple elimination events are printed in alphabetical order.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and handles all the requirements and constraints of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
