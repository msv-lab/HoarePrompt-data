Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `l` is updated to either `mid + 1` or `mid`, depending on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`; `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively. The other variables (`ans`, `l`, and `mid`) remain as described in the initial state, with `l` potentially being updated based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`. The value of `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
