Output State: **`h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`.**

Explanation: The variable `h` is assigned the value of `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`. The value of `l` remains unchanged and is still the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`. The precondition that `F` must not be empty is still valid.
