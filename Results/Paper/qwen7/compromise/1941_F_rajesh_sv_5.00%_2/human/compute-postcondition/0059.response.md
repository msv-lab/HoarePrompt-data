Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` and `h` must satisfy `l < h`.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively. The initial conditions that `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2` and `l < h` remain unchanged.
