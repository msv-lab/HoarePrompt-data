Let's break down the loop head and the conditions to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Loop Head:
```
while l < h:
```

### States at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans` remains the minimum value it has been updated to throughout the entire loop execution.
- `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged.
- `l` is updated to the value returned by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`.
- `h` is assigned the value `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.
- `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is reassigned accordingly.
- Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid` and `l` is updated to the value returned by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `l` is updated to `bisect_right(D, left - f)`.
   - `h` is assigned `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.
   - `mid` is calculated based on `l` and `h`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l < h`.

3. **Possible Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `h`.
   - The values of `l` and `h` can change based on the condition inside the loop.

### Conditions Inside the Loop:
- If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`:
  - `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
  - `h` is reassigned accordingly.
- Otherwise:
  - `h` is set to `mid`.
  - `l` is updated to the value returned by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be less than `h`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l < h` holds true.

### Final Answer:
State: **`l` must be less than `h`**.

This ensures that the loop condition `l < h` is satisfied for the next iteration.
