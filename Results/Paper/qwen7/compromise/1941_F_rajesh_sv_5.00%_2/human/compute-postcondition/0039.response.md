Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`, and `F` must not be empty.**

Explanation: The code `l = bisect_right(D, left - f)` uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the index of the first element in the list `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`. The value of `F` remains unchanged and is still not empty.
