Postcondition: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is either the second largest difference or remains unchanged, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs or remains None, `i` is 4. If `diff` (which is A[3] - A[2]) is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff` and `index` is set to 4. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`.**
