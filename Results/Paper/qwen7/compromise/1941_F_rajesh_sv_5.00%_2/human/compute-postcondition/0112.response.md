Postcondition: **`ans` remains the minimum value it has been updated to throughout the entire loop execution, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged, `l` is updated to the value returned by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`, `h` is assigned the value `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, and `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is reassigned accordingly. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid` and `l` is updated to the value returned by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering both possible outcomes of the if condition.
