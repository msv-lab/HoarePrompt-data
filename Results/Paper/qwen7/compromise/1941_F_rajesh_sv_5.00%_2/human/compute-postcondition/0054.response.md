Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `mid`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`.**

Explanation: The line `h = mid` updates the value of `h` to be equal to the current value of `mid`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, `h`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
