Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found across all elements in the array `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference found or remains unchanged, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurs or remains `None`, `i` is `n-1`, `diff` is `A[n-1] - A[n-2]`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `A[index - 1]` to the variable `left` and the value of `A[index]` to the variable `right`. The other variables (`max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `i`, and `diff`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
