Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `while l < h`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `l < h`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
   - `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
   - `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`
   - `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`
   - `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `l < h` must be true.
   - Given that `l` must be less than `h` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that this condition holds true for the next iteration.

5. **Analyze the possible changes**:
   - `l` and `h` are the only variables that directly affect the loop condition `l < h`.
   - The values of `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, and the way they are calculated do not directly affect the loop continuation condition.

6. **Ensure the loop can execute one more time**:
   - Since `l` must be less than `h` for the loop to continue, and given that `l` must be less than `h` at the end of the previous iteration, no adjustments are necessary to these variables for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`**
