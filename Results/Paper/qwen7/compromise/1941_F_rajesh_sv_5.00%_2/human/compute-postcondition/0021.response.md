Output State: **`max_diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or remains unchanged, `index` is 4, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `index`. Since `i` was initially 4, `index` is now 4. The values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `i` remain unchanged.
