Output State: **`max_diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or remains unchanged, `index` is None, `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code sets `max_diff` to the value of `diff`, which is `A[3] - A[2]`. The other variables (`next_max_diff`, `index`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
