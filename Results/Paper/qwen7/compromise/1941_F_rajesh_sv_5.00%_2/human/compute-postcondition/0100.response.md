Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is the variable `f` from the range `F`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are values in `F` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the minimum value it has been updated to throughout the entire loop execution.
   - `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged.
   - `l` and `h` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `f` is the only variable changing within the loop head, we need to ensure that `f` is set to the next value in `F`.
   - `ans`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, and `h` should remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself but rather by the loop body.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The only change needed is to set `f` to the next value in `F`.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

**State: **`ans` is the minimum value it has been updated to throughout the entire loop execution, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged, `l` and `h` remain unchanged, `f` is the next value in `F`**.
