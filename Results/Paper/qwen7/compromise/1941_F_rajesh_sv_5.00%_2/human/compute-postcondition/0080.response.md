Postcondition: `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`; otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`, and `l` remains as the index such that all elements in the list `D` up to index `l` are less than or equal to `left - f`.
