State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head is `for _ in range(testcases):`, which means the loop will execute `testcases` number of times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `testcases` must be greater than 0.
3. No other variables or states outside of `testcases` are involved in determining the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `testcases` must be greater than 0.
