Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is `mid + 1`, the condition `(mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum)` is satisfied.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to `mid + 1`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, `h`) remain unchanged. The condition mentioned in the initial state is still valid.
