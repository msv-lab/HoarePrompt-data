You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

    1000000000 1000000000

Output

    Bob
    Alice

    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a specified number of test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calls another function `func_1(a, b)` to determine the result. It collects these results in a list and then prints each result. The function does not modify the input integer \(t\) (the number of test cases) and ensures that the final output is a list of results corresponding to each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their respective wallets.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., a wallet with zero or fewer coins) loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Strategy**:
   - If both players play optimally, the key observation is that the game essentially boils down to the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. For example, if Alice removes a coin from her wallet, Bob can remove a coin from his wallet, ensuring that the sum remains even until the end. This strategy ensures Bob wins.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, Alice can always ensure that the sum becomes even after her move, forcing Bob into a losing position. This strategy ensures Alice wins.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob', indicating Bob wins.
   - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice', indicating Alice wins.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

Given the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

The given program is correct based on the problem description.
