Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers with at least one element, `a` is the next element in `inp`, `x` is equal to `y`, and `y` is now equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a` to `y`. The other variables (`inp`, `a`, `x`, and `y`) are updated accordingly. The initial state of `x` being equal to `y` remains unchanged, and `y` now holds the value of `a`.
