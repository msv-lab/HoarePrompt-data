Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop will run based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is valid.
   - The input value should be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

3. **State Before the Loop:**
   - We know that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - For the loop to execute, the input value must be within this range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, which should be a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
