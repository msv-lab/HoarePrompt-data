Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is the count of unique minimum elements encountered in `inp`, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code sets both `x` and `y` to `n + 1`. The values of `inp`, `ans`, `x`, `y`, and `n` are updated accordingly, but the nature of `inp`, `ans`, and `y` (if there are multiple minimum elements) remains as described in the initial state.
