Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is the minimum value in the list `inp`, `y` is the second smallest value in the list `inp`, `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than `y`, and `inp` is the same list as before.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `x` will hold the smallest element in the list `inp`, because the loop continuously updates `x` to be the smallest value encountered so far. Similarly, `y` will hold the second smallest element in the list `inp`, as the loop updates `y` to be the smallest value among the current `y` and any new value `a` that is larger than `x` but smaller than or equal to `y`. The variable `ans` will count how many times the condition `a > y` is true, which corresponds to the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than the second smallest element.
