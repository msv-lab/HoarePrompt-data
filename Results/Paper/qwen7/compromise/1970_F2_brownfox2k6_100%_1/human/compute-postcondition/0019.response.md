Based on the initial state provided:

```python
print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
```

The variables `t` and `p` are not explicitly defined with any values in the given initial state. Therefore, they will be printed as their current undefined states, which are typically represented as their variable names.

Output: **t, p, ELIMINATED**
