Based on the initial state provided:

- `p` is the next element from the sorted `out`.
- `out` must contain at least one element.

The `print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')` statement will print three parts:
1. `t`: This variable's value is not specified in the initial state, so it will remain as `t`.
2. `p`: Since `p` is the next element from the sorted `out`, and `out` contains at least one element, `p` will be the next element in the sorted order of `out`.
3. `'ELIMINATED'`: This is a string literal and will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **t, p, 'ELIMINATED'**
