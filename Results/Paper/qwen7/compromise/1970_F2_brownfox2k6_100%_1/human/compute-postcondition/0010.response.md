Postcondition: `out` is an empty list, `t` is an integer, `player` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. If the value of `player[p]` is `blud`, then `out` is updated to contain the key `p`, and the value of `player[p]` is set to `[-1, -1]`. If the value of `player[p]` is not `blud`, no changes are made to `out` and `player`.
