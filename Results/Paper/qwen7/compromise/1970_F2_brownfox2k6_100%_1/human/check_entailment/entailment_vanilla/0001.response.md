Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function updates the position of an entity based on the direction (`d`). It correctly adjusts the coordinates (`obj`) based on the direction provided. This function seems to be correctly implemented and would work as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is intended to handle the elimination of players when a Bludger hits them. However, there are a few issues with this function:
   - The function assumes that `player` is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers and values are their positions. It also assumes that `blud` is a key in this dictionary, which might not always be the case.
   - The function checks if the player's position matches the Bludger's position and then updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]`, indicating they have been eliminated. However, it does not handle the case where multiple players are hit by the Bludger simultaneously.
   - The function sorts the players alphabetically before printing their elimination, which is correct. However, the function should ensure that the player's positions are updated correctly before sorting and printing.

Given these points, the function `func_2` has some logical flaws and might not work as intended in all scenarios. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program cannot be determined as True without further context and additional functions that are not provided in the snippet.

Correctness: **False**
