Output State: **`s` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1 for the next element `1` in `s`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, and `0`s count in `s` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. If true, `ans` is incremented by 1. The value of `s` and the count of zeroes in `s` remain unchanged. The variable `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1 for the next element `1` in `s`.
