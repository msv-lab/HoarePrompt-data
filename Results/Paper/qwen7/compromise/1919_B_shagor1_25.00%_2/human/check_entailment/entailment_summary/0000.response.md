Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Here's why:

1. **Penalty Calculation**: According to the problem, the penalty is calculated based on the optimal way to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized. However, the provided program simply counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and uses this to compute a penalty-like value without considering any splitting strategy.

2. **Splitting Strategy**: The program does not attempt to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. Instead, it directly computes `n - 2 * neg`, which does not reflect the optimal penalty calculation as described in the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle edge cases properly. For example, if the string `s` consists only of '+' characters, the program should return `n` because the penalty would be zero (since the sum of each subarray would be positive). Similarly, if the string `s` consists only of '-' characters, the program should also return `n`.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
