You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

    +
    
    5

    +-+-+-
    
    10
    
    --+++++++-

    +---++++-+++++---++-

Output

    1
    5
    0
    4
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-', where the i-th character of s represents a_i = 1 if s_i = '+' and a_i = -1 if s_i = '-'.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
    #This is printed: n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where `n` is the input integer and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   - It then calculates the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and stores it in `neg`.

3. **Calculating the Penalty:**
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the program prints `n - 2 * neg`.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the program prints `n`.

### Understanding the Logic

To understand the logic, let's break down the formula used in the program:
- `n - 2 * neg` essentially calculates the difference between the total number of elements (`n`) and twice the number of negative elements (`-`).
- This formula seems to be derived from the observation that splitting the array into alternating segments (one positive and one negative) might minimize the penalty.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples to see if it produces the correct output.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `1`
- Input: `+`
- Expected Output: `1`

```python
n = 1
neg = 0
print(n - 2 * neg)
```

#### Example 2:
- Input: `5`
- Input: `-----`
- Expected Output: `5`

```python
n = 5
neg = 5
print(n - 2 * neg)
```
- Output: `5` (Correct)

#### Example 3:
- Input: `6`
- Input: `+-+-+`
- Expected Output: `0`

```python
n = 6
neg = 3
print(n - 2 * neg)
```
- Output: `0` (Correct)

#### Example 4:
- Input: `10`
- Input: `--+++++++`
- Expected Output: `4`

```python
n = 10
neg = 8
print(n - 2 * neg)
```
- Output: `4` (Correct)

#### Example 5:
- Input: `20`
- Input: `+---++++-+++++---++-`
- Expected Output: `4`

```python
n = 20
neg = 12
print(n - 2 * neg)
```
- Output: `4` (Correct)
