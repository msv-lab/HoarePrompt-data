Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function.
- The function processes each test case individually.
- It initializes `s` to 1 and then iteratively updates `s` based on the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x` iterations.
- The final value of `s` after these iterations is calculated as `(2^x - 1) * (k - 1) + 1`.
- The function then compares `a` (initial number of coins) with `s` and prints "Yes" if `a >= s`, otherwise it prints "No".
- This logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.
- The function correctly handles the constraints and the conditions specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
