Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i < x`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `x` is the updated value from the input (`new_x`).

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 or 1, after one iteration, `i` will become 1 or 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `x` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body does not change `x`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 (from 0 or 1 to 1 or 2).
- `x` remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
**`i` is 1 or 2, `x` is the updated value from the input (`new_x`), `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`**.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we keep it as `new_x`.

Final State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `x` is `new_x`, `s` is `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`**.
