Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\) and is set to the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\) and is set to the second integer from the input, `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\) and is set to the third integer from the input, `s` is 8, `i` is 3, and the input value for the loop is any valid positive integer.**

The code `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. The values of `t`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged.
