Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\) and is set to the first integer from the input, `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\) and must be at least 3, `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\) and is set to the third integer from the input, `s` is 2, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to it. Given the initial state, `s` starts as 1. The value of `k` is taken from the second input, and `s` is updated to `1 + 1 = 2`. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
