Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `s` is 4, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The initial value of `s` is 2. The code updates `s` to `s + s // (k - 1) + 1`. Since `k` is between 2 and 30, `k - 1` is between 1 and 29. The floor division `s // (k - 1)` will be 2 because `s` is 2 and `k - 1` is at least 1. Therefore, `s` becomes `2 + 2 + 1 = 4`. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
