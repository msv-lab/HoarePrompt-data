Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` is 5, `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `s` is 1, `i` is 3, `k` is updated with the first value from input, `x` is updated with the second value from input, and `a` is updated with the third value from input.**

Explanation: The code `k, x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. Since the initial values of `x` and `i` are not updated by the input, they remain as `5` and `3` respectively. The values of `t` and `s` are also not affected by the input, so they remain within their initial constraints.
