Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `s` is 8, `i` is 3.

Explanation: The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration and updates `s` according to the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. After 3 iterations, `i` will be 3. The value of `s` starts from 1 and is updated as follows:
- After 1st iteration: \(s = 1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1 = 2\)
- After 2nd iteration: \(s = 2 + 2 // (k - 1) + 1 = 4\)
- After 3rd iteration: \(s = 4 + 4 // (k - 1) + 1 = 6\)

Following this pattern, after 4 iterations (all iterations of the loop), `s` will be \(6 + 6 // (k - 1) + 1 = 8\). The other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
