Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers that must not be empty, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first element of `data`, `s` is `i` XOR `check`**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of `i` XOR `check`. Here, `i` is the first element of the list `data`, and `check` is 2147483647. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
