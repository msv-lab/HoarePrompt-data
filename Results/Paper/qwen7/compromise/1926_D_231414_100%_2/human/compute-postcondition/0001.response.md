Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation: The code sets `check` to the value of \(2^{31} - 1\), which is 2147483647. This does not affect the values of `times` or `t`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `times` and `t`, while adding the new value for `check`.
