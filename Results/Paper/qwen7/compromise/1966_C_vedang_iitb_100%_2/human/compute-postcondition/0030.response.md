Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `tc` in the range of `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `tc` is less than `t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `tc` is 0
   - `t` is an input integer
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements removed
   - `maxsize` is 0 (since the list `a` is now empty)
   - `mexsize` is 5

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `tc` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `tc < t`, after the first iteration, `tc` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `tc` will become 1.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` remain unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

**State: **`tc` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements removed, `maxsize` is 0 (since the list `a` is now empty), and `mexsize` is 5**.
