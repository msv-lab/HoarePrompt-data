Output State: **`tc` is 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split, `maxsize` is 0, and `mexsize` is 5.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input line, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The other variables (`tc`, `t`, `n`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
