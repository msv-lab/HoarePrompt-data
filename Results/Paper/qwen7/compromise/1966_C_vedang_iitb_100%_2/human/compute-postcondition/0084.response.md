Output State: **Postcondition: `tc` is equal to `t-1`, `t` is an input integer, `n` is the last input integer for the final test case, `a` is a sorted list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile for the final test case, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. The value of `mexsize` is either greater than `maxsize` or is the smallest integer greater than `maxsize` if there are gaps in the sequence of integers in `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the function prints 'Alice' if `mexsize` is even, otherwise 'Bob'. If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, the function prints 'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob'.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `tc` will be `t-1`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The list `a` will be sorted and contain the initial number of stones for the last test case. `maxsize` will be the largest number in this list. `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not found in the list `a`. Based on the comparison between `mexsize` and `maxsize`, and whether `mexsize` is even or odd, the loop will print either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.
