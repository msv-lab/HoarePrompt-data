Output State: **`sz` is the first element of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and the current value of `mexsize` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `mexsize` by 1. Since `sz` was initially equal to `mexsize`, `sz` remains unchanged. The list `a` and its first element `sz` stay the same, and only `mexsize` is updated to its new value, which is `mexsize + 1`.
