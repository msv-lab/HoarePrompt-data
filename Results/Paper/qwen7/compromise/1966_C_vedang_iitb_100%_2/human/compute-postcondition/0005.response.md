Output State: **`tc` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`tc`, `t`, `n`, and `maxsize`) remain unchanged. After sorting, `a` becomes a sorted version of its original list, and `maxsize` is updated to be the maximum value in the sorted list `a`.
