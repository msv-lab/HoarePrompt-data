Output State: **`sz` is the third element of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `mexsize` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code increments `mexsize` by 1. The initial conditions for `sz` and the list `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, `sz` remains as the third element of the list `a`, which is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `mexsize` is now one more than its original value.
