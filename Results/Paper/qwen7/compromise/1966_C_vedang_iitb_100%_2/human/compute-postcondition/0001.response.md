Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `tc` which is used to iterate over the range of `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `tc` is less than `t`. This means that `tc` should be initialized to 0 and incremented within the loop.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will start with `tc` being 0 and will increment `tc` by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `tc` should be set to 0. The value of `t` itself does not change during the loop execution but must be known to determine how many times the loop will run.

4. **Final state adjustment**: The state before the loop starts should reflect that `tc` is 0 and `t` is the given input integer.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to:

**State: **`tc` is 0, `t` is an input integer**
