Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `sz` is the second element of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is increased by 1.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a` using the variable `sz`.

3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `sz` must be the third element of the list `a`. This is because the loop starts from the second element and moves to the next element in each iteration.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `sz` is the next element in the list, it will be the third element.
   - The list `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - If `sz` (which is now the third element) equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` will be increased by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`sz` is the third element of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and if `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is increased by 1**.
