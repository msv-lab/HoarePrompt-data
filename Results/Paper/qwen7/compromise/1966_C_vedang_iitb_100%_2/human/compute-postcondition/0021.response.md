Output State: **Postcondition: `tc` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements removed, `maxsize` is 0 (since the list `a` is now empty), and `mexsize` is 5.**

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `mexsize` by 1 each time it encounters an element in the list `a` that matches the current value of `mexsize`. After the loop has executed as many times as there are elements in the list `a`, the list `a` will be empty. At this point, `mexsize` will be incremented one more time than the number of elements in the original list, making it `mexsize = 4 + (number of elements in `a`)`. Since the loop removes the first element of `a` each iteration, and we know it executes up to the length of `a`, when `a` is empty, `mexsize` will be `4 + len(a)`. Given that `a` is now empty, `mexsize` becomes 5.
