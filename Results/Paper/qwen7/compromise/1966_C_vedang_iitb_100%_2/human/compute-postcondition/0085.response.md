Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (number of piles), and a list of n integers a representing the initial number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it returns information about the distribution of stones across the piles.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of parameters (t, n, and a), and for each test case, it processes the data to provide some form of output based on the distribution of stones across the piles. However, since the function definition itself does not include any parameters, the description focuses on what the function is expected to do based on the provided constraints and output cases.
