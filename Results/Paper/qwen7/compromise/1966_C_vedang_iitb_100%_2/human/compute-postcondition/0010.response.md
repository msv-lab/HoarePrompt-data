Output State: **`tc` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 2, and the length of the list `a` is equal to 1.**

Explanation: The variable `mexsize` was initially set to 1. After executing the line `mexsize = mexsize + 1`, `mexsize` is incremented by 1, making its new value 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
