Postcondition: `tc` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, and `mexsize` is 2. If the length of the list `a` is equal to 1, then the length of `a` remains 1.
