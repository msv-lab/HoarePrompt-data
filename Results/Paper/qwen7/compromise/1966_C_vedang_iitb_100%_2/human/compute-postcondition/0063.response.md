Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `sz`, which iterates over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `sz`**: Since `sz` is iterating over the list `a`, the initial value of `sz` should be the first element of the list `a`.

3. **Determine the State of `a`**: The list `a` is already defined and contains sorted integers.

4. **Consider Other Variables**: The other variables (`tc`, `t`, `n`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

5. **Ensure the List `a` is Not Empty**: For the loop to execute at least once, the list `a` must contain at least one element.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `sz` should be set to the first element of the list `a`.
- `a` must be a non-empty list.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`sz` is the first element of the list `a`, `a` is a non-empty list of sorted integers**.
