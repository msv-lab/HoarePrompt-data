Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description. The solution simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and prints their difference. However, the problem requires splitting the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty, which is not achieved by just counting the '+' and '-' characters.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. This involves evaluating different possible splits and choosing the one with the lowest penalty. The current solution does not account for these complexities and thus is incorrect.
