Output State: **`s` is an input integer, `P` is the total number of '+' characters in the input string `e`, `M` is the total number of '-' or any other character in the input string `e`, `i` is `N + 1`, `N` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `e` is now the input string, and we have read the input string.**

Explanation: The code `e = input()` reads an input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `e`. The values of `s`, `P`, `M`, `i`, `N`, and the original state of `e` (which was an empty string) remain unchanged, except that `e` now holds the input string provided by the user.
