Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is not '+', `M` is 1**.

The value of `M` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which was at least 0 since it's a non-negative integer). Given no specific initial value for `M` is provided, we assume it was at least 0 before the increment. After the increment, `M` is now 1. The states of `e` and `q` remain unchanged.
