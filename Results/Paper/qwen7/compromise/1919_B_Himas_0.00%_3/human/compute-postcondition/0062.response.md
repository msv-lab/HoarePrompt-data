Output State: **`e` is an input string with at least one character, `P` is 2, and `M` is 1 if `q` was not '+', otherwise `M` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `P` is incremented by 1, so if `P` was initially 1 (indicating `q` was '+'), it becomes 2. If `P` was initially 0 (indicating `q` was not '+'), it becomes 1. The value of `e` remains unchanged, and the value of `M` remains dependent on the condition of `q`.
