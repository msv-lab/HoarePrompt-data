Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `e` is a non-empty string.
- `q` is the next character in the string `e`.
- If `q` equals '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1.
- If `q` is not '+', then `M` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Head:
```
for q in e:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `e`, so the variable `q` is the only one directly controlled by the loop.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - `e` remains the same as it is the string being iterated over.
   - `q` will be the next character in the string `e` for the next iteration.
   - If `q` was '+' in the previous iteration, `P` and `M` were set to specific values. For the next iteration, `P` and `M` will be adjusted based on the new value of `q`.

### Possible Scenarios for the Next Iteration:
- If `q` was '+' in the previous iteration:
  - `P` is 2.
  - `M` is 1.
  - The next character `q` will be the one after the current position.
- If `q` was not '+' in the previous iteration:
  - `M` was incremented by 1.
  - The next character `q` will be the one after the current position.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `q` will be the next character in the string `e`. The state of `e` remains unchanged, and the state of `q` will be updated to the next character. The values of `P` and `M` will be adjusted based on the new value of `q`.

### Updated State:
- `e` remains the same.
- `q` becomes the next character in the string `e`.
- If the new `q` is '+', `P` remains 2 and `M` remains 1.
- If the new `q` is not '+', `M` is incremented by 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e`, if `q` equals '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1, otherwise `M` is incremented by 1**.
