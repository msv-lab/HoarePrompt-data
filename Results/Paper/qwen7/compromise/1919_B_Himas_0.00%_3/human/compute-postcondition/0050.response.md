Output State: **`s` is an input integer, `P` is the total number of '+' characters in the original string `e`, `M` is the total number of '-' or any other character in the original string `e`, `i` is `N + 1`, `N` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, and `e` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `s = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `s`. All other variables (`P`, `M`, `i`, `N`, `s`, and `e`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
