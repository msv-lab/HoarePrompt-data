Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `e` is a non-empty string.
   - If `q` equals '+', then `P` is 1.
   - Otherwise, if `q` is not '+', then `M` is 1.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each character `q` in the string `e`.

3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `q` from the string `e` must be considered.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `e`, the variable `q` will change to the next character in the string.
   - The string `e` remains the same.
   - The postconditions for `P` and `M` will be evaluated based on the new value of `q`.

5. **New State**:
   - `e` remains a non-empty string (since it hasn't changed).
   - `q` changes to the next character in the string `e`.
   - If the new `q` is '+', then `P` will be 1.
   - If the new `q` is not '+', then `M` will be 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the new value of `q` and the updated postconditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e`, if `q` equals '+', then `P` is 1. Otherwise, if `q` is not '+', then `M` is 1**.
