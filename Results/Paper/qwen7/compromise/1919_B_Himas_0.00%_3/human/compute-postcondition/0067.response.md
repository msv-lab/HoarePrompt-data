Output State: **`e` is a string with at least two characters, `q` is the second character in the string, `P` is 3 if `q` is '+', and `P` is 3 if `q` is not '+'**.

Explanation: The value of `P` is incremented by 1, so if `q` was '+' making `P` equal to 2, now `P` becomes 3. If `q` was not '+', making `P` equal to 2, now `P` remains 3. The states of the other variables (`e`, `q`, and `M`) are not affected.
