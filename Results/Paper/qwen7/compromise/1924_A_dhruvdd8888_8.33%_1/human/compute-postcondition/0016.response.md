Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an input consisting of an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), followed by t test cases. Each test case includes integers n and k (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26), an integer m (where 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and a string s of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, if a certain condition is met, the function prints 'YES'.**
