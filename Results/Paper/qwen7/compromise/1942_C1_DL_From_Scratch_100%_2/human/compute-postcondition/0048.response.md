Output State: **`i` is `i_end_prev + 2`, `x` is the same, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `num` as `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`. This value is assigned to the variable `num`, but the initial state of `i` and `x` remains unchanged. The condition for increasing `count` by 1 (if `num` equals 1) is not checked here, only the calculation for `num` is performed.
