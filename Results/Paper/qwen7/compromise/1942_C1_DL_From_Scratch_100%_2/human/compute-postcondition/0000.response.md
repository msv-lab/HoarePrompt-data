Output State: **`T` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, which is within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4. All other variables are unchanged.**

This means that the variable `T` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user, ensuring it falls within the specified range. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) remain in their initial state as described in the precondition.
