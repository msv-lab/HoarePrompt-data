Postcondition: `count` is either 1 or 2, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is greater than 1, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is `i_end_prev + 1`, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1. If `num` equals 1, then `count` is set to 2; otherwise, `count` remains 1.
