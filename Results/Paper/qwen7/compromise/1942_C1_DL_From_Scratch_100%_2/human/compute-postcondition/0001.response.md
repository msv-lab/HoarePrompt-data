Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder variable) and the variable `T`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `T` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since `T` is an integer obtained from `int(input())` and it is guaranteed to be within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `T` itself. Specifically, `T` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `T` being greater than 0.

**State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
