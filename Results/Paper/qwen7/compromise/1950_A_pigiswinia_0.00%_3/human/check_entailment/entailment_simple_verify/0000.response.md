### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to determine if the digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a stair, a peak, or neither.
   - A stair satisfies \(a < b < c\).
   - A peak satisfies \(a < b > c\).
   - If neither condition is met, it is "NONE".

2. **Program Code**:
   ```python
   def func():
       t = int(input())
       for i in range(t):
           (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
           if a < b < c:
               print('STAIRS')  # Correct condition for stair
           elif a < b > c:
               print('PEAK')    # Correct condition for peak
           else:
               print('NONE')    # Default condition
   ```

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the states and conditions.
   - The conditions for "STAIRS" and "PEAK" are correctly identified and implemented.
   - The default condition for "NONE" is also correctly handled.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program has a typo in the output statement for the "STAIRS" case, printing 'STAIRS' instead of 'STAIR'.
   - However, upon reviewing the code, we see that the correct string 'STAIRS' is being printed when the condition \(a < b < c\) is met.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is incorrect because there is no typo in the output statement for the "STAIRS" case. The program correctly prints 'STAIRS' when the condition is met.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
