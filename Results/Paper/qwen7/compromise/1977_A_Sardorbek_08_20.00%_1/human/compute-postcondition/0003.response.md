Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three integers: t, n, and m, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and for each test case, n and m are positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

Given the constraints and implied processing, the function likely handles multiple test cases defined by t, where for each test case, it processes pairs of integers n and m. However, without explicit return details, the function's output behavior cannot be precisely described beyond the parameter constraints.
