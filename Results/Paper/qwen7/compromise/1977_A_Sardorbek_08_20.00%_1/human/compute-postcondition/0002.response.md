Output State: **The output state will consist of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions given. The specific values of 'b' and 'c' entered during each iteration will determine which output is printed.**

This means that for each line of input within the loop, the program will print either 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' depending on the comparison between `b` and `c`. The exact sequence of these outputs will depend on the values of `b` and `c` provided during each iteration of the loop.
