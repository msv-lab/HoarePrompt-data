You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The output state will consist of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions given. The specific values of 'b' and 'c' entered during each iteration will determine which output is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( b \) and \( c \). For each test case, it prints 'YES' if \( b \) equals \( c \), 'NO' if \( b \) is less than \( c \), 'Yes' if both \( b \) and \( a \) have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function reads the number of test cases \( t \) first, then iterates through each test case to perform these checks and print the corresponding result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It stores these values in a tuple `q = (b, c)`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes).
     - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than moves allow.
   - If `b` is greater than `c`, it further checks if `b % 2 == c % 2`.
     - If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Case 1: `b == c`:**
   - If the number of moves (`b`) is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes (`c`), Nikita can simply add one cube per move, ending up with `c` cubes. This is correctly handled by printing 'YES'.

2. **Case 2: `b < c`:**
   - If the number of moves (`b`) is less than the desired number of cubes (`c`), it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves. This is correctly handled by printing 'NO'.

3. **Case 3: `b > c`:**
   - If the number of moves (`b`) is greater than the desired number of cubes (`c`), we need to check if the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves matches the parity of the desired number of cubes.
     - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it means the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in `c` cubes. This is correctly handled by printing 'Yes'.
     - If `b % 2 != c % 2`, it means the parity does not match, making it impossible to end up with `c` cubes. This is correctly handled by printing 'No'.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
