### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key conditions and their handling in the program. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure completeness and accuracy:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it correctly reads two integers `b` and `c` representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes respectively.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: `b == c`:**
     - If the number of moves (`b`) is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes (`c`), the program correctly prints 'YES'. This is because Nikita can simply add one cube per move, resulting in `c` cubes.
   - **Case 2: `b < c`:**
     - If the number of moves (`b`) is less than the desired number of cubes (`c`), the program correctly prints 'NO'. This is because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves allows.
   - **Case 3: `b > c`:**
     - If the number of moves (`b`) is greater than the desired number of cubes (`c`), the program correctly checks if the parity of `b` and `c` match.
       - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'Yes'. This is because the parity check ensures that the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in `c` cubes.
       - If `b % 2 != c % 2`, it prints 'No'. This is because the parity mismatch makes it impossible to end up with `c` cubes.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and reasoning.
