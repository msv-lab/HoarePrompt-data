Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `b` (the number of moves) is odd and `c` (the desired number of cubes) is even, or vice versa. According to the problem description, the parity (odd or even nature) of `b` and `c` must match for it to be possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves. However, the program incorrectly prints 'Yes' in the case where `a % 2 == b % 2`, which is always true since `a` is just the number of test cases and does not affect the result. 

A correct implementation should check if `b` and `c` have the same parity. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This version correctly checks the parity of `b` and `c` and prints 'YES' if they match, otherwise 'NO'.
