Postcondition: `ii` is 4, `ck` is 2, `cn` is either 1 or 2, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `num[0]`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and if `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
