Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `j` is `n - 1`.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains greater than 0, `r` remains 0, `f` is set to 0, `n` must be at least 1, `num` remains as a list of integers entered by the user, and the index `j` will be `n - 1`. The variable `f` is set to 0 if any two consecutive elements in the list `num` are not equal, otherwise, it remains 0 regardless of whether such a pair was found or not.
