Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is not explicitly initialized in the given state; it will be set to 0 by default when the loop starts.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j < n - 1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `range(n - 1)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n - 2`, meaning `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to run at all).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means `n` must be greater than 1, and `j` will be set to 0 initially.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (it must be greater than 1) and `j` (it will be set to 0).

**Final State**:
State: **`ii` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1, `ck` is either 0 or 1, `cn` is equal to `ck`, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user, `j` is 0**
