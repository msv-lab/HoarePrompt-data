Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is 1, and either `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `cn` is 1; `ck` is 1; `symb1` is the first character of `num`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first character of the string `num` to the variable `symb1`. Since `num` is a string, `symb1` will hold the value of the first character in `num`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
