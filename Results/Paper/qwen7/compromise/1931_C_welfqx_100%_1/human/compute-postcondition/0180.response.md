The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop. Since the condition `n == 1 or f == 1` is true and the loop has already iterated through all elements in `num` without breaking (meaning `f` remains 0), the loop will continue to the next iteration due to the `continue` statement. However, since the loop has completed its iterations and there are no changes to the variables outside the loop, the values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ii` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of the list `num`, `ck` is either 0 or 1, `cn` is equal to `ck`, `r` is 5, `f` is 0, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
