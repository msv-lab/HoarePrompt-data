The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 0
- `n` is greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
