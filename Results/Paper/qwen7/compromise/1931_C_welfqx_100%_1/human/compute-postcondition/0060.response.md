Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `ii` is 0
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - If `onum[0]` is equal to `onum[1]`, then `ck` is set to 1. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for ii in range(n - 1):`
   - The only variable in the loop head is `ii`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `ii` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is 0 and `n` is at least 2.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `ii` starts from 0 and the loop increments `ii` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `ii` will be 1.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `ii` must be 1 and `n` must still be at least 2.

5. **Final State:**
   - `ii` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 2

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
