Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether any two consecutive elements in `num` are different, and either `n` equals 1 or `f` equals 1; `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`; `cn` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `cn = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `cn`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, `f`, `onum`, and their conditions remain unchanged.
