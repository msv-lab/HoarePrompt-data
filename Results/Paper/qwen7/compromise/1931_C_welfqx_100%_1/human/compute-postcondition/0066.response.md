Output State: **`ii` is 2 or 3; `n` must be at least 3; `ck` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `ck` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other number). Since no specific initial value for `ck` is given, we assume it was 0 before the increment. After the increment, `ck` becomes 1. The values of `ii` and `n` remain unchanged.
