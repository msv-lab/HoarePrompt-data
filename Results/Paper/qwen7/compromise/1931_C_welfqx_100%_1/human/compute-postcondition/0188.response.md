Output State: **`ii` is 4, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1, `r` is 5, `f` is 1, `onum` is a list which is the reverse of the original `num` list, `symb1` is `num[0]`**.

In this case, the code assigns the first element of the `num` list (which is the reverse of the original `num` list) to the variable `symb1`. Since the exact values of the elements in the `num` list are not provided, `symb1` is simply the first element of the reversed `num` list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
