Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `ii` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ii` and `n`**:
   - `ii` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` is a constant or variable that determines the number of iterations.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `ii < n - 1`.
   - After all iterations, `ii` should be `n - 2`.

4. **Determine the Final State of `ii`**:
   - Since the loop runs until `ii < n - 1`, the final value of `ii` will be `n - 2`.

5. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - `cn` (count of consecutive identical elements) is mentioned but not used in the loop head. Its initial state is not directly relevant to the loop head.
   - `num` (the list of numbers) is also mentioned but not used in the loop head. Its initial state is not directly relevant to the loop head.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the loop head variables.
   - `ii` must start at 0 and end at `n - 2`.
   - `n` must be at least 2 to allow for at least one iteration (`ii < n - 1`).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `ii` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ii` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
