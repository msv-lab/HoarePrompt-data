Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user, `j` is `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `cn` is 1.**

The code initializes the variable `cn` to 1. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `cn` is now set to 1.
