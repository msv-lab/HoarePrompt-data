Output State: **`num` is a list of integers, `cn` is increased by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the length of the list `num`**.

Explanation: The code `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. The conditions for incrementing `cn` (if `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`) and the increment of `i` (`i += 1`) are not specified to occur within the context of this single line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `cn` is increased by 1. The other variables (`num`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
