Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ii` and `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `ii`**: Since the loop has executed all its iterations and `i` (which corresponds to `ii` in the loop) is 3, `ii` must have started from 0 and incremented until it reached 3. Therefore, `ii` must be less than `n - 1` but equal to 3 after all iterations.

3. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: The value of `n` is given as 4. This means `n - 1` is 3.

4. **Ensure the loop condition is met**: For the loop to execute, `ii` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `ii` is 3 and `n - 1` is 3, the loop should stop when `ii` reaches 3. However, the loop should have executed all its iterations, meaning `ii` must be exactly 3 at the end of the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `ii` and `n`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `ii` must be 3 (since the loop has executed all its iterations and `ii` is 3).
- `n` must be 4 (since `n - 1` is 3).

So, the final state is:

**State: **`ii` is 3, `n` is 4**
