Output: **0**

Explanation:
- `ii` is explicitly given as 4.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of the list `num`. However, the exact value of `n` is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `ck` is either 0 or 1.
- `cn` is equal to `ck`, so `cn` is also either 0 or 1.
- `r` is explicitly given as 5.
- `f` is explicitly given as 0, and it remains 0 because the condition `n == 1 or f == 1` is true, and the loop has iterated through all elements in `num` such that no two consecutive elements are different.

The print statement simply outputs the integer 0, regardless of the other variables' values.
