Output State: **ii is n, ck is 4 or 3, cn is either 1 or 2, r is 5, f is 1, onum is the reverse of the original num list, symb1 is num[0], symb2 is num[0], i is equal to n.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ii` will increment until it reaches `n-1`, making `ii` finally equal to `n` when the loop terminates. The value of `ck` will be either 4 or 3, depending on whether the condition `onum[ii] == onum[ii + 1]` was met during the last iteration. The values of `cn`, `r`, `f`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
