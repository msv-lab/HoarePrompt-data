Postcondition: `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is the count of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning of the list `onum`, and `cn` is increased by `ck`. This means that if `symb1` equals `symb2`, `ck` is added to `cn`, and if they do not equal, the condition for exiting the loop is met without changing `cn`.
