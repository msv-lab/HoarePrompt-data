Output State: **`ii` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to the length of the list `num`, `ck` is either 0 or 1, `cn` is equal to `ck`, `r` is 5, `f` is 0, `onum` is a list which is the reverse of the original `num` list.**

Explanation: The code `onum.reverse()` reverses the list `onum`. Since `onum` is a copy of the original `num` list, after reversing, `onum` becomes the reversed version of the original `num` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
