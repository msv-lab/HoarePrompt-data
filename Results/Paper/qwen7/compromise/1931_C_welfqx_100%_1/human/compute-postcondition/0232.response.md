Output State: **All iterations completed. The final output will be based on the last value of `n` provided as input, and the values of `cn` and `ck` calculated during the last iteration.**

**Explanation:**
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the final state will depend on the last value of `t` (the number of inputs), and the corresponding lists `num` and `onum` (the reversed version of `num`). The loop processes each input list to determine the maximum length of consecutive identical elements (`max(cn, ck)`) and then prints `n - max(cn, ck)` where `n` is the length of the input list. 

Since the loop iterates based on the value of `t`, and given that `t` is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the final output will be derived from the last input list processed. The variables `cn` and `ck` will hold their respective counts from the last iteration, and `symb1` and `symb2` will reflect the first element of the last processed list. The final output will be `n - max(cn, ck)`, where `n` is the length of the last input list.
