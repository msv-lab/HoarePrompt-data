Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself. This part is correct.

2. **Identical Elements Check**: 
   - The code checks if all elements in the array are identical by iterating through the array and breaking if any pair of consecutive elements differ. This is a valid approach but might not be the most efficient way to handle large arrays.

3. **Reversing the Array**:
   - The array is reversed to check for the longest sequence of identical elements from the end. This is a good idea to cover cases where the longest sequence starts from the beginning or the end of the array.

4. **Calculating Longest Identical Sequences**:
   - Two variables `cn` and `ck` are used to store the lengths of the longest sequences of identical elements starting from the beginning and the end of the array, respectively. This is correct.

5. **Handling Identical Start and End Symbols**:
   - If the first and last elements of the original and reversed arrays are the same, the code adds the lengths of the sequences from both ends. This is correct because it ensures that the entire array can be made uniform with a single operation.

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the minimum cost required to make all elements equal by subtracting the maximum of `cn` and `ck` from `n`. This is correct because it represents the minimum number of operations needed to make the array uniform.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like a single-element array or an array with all identical elements correctly by printing `0`.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It efficiently finds the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.

Correctness: **True**
