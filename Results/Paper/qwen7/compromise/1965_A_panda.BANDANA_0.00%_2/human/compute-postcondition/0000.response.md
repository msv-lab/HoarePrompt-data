Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is constrained to be between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), the updated state of `t` is an input integer within this range. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged, so the output state includes the updated value of `t` and maintains the original constraints on `n` and the list of integers.
