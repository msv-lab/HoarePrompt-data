Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), and `p`, a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer's absolute value is less than or equal to `n`. It returns the value of `dp` at index `final_sum`, where `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, and `dp` represents the cumulative effect of adding adjacent values from the previous state, taken modulo `MOD`.**
