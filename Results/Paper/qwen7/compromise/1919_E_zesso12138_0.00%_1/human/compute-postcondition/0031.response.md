Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for res in results:`. The only variable mentioned here is `res`, which is an element from the `results` list.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `results` list. Each iteration processes one element from `results`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
   - `index` is set to the initial value (though it is not used in the loop itself).
   - `t` is 0.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `res` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to adjust the state of `results`.
   - After processing one element from `results`, the list `results` will have one less element.
   - All other variables (`index`, `t`, `p`, and `data`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **New State:**
   - `results` will have one less element than before.
   - `index`, `t`, `p`, and `data` remain the same.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, p)` with one less element, `index` is set to the initial value, `t` is 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace**.
