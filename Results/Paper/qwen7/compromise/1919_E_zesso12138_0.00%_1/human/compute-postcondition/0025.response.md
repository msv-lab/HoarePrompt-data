Output State: **`index` is increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is an integer value equal to `data[index]`, `t` is greater than 0, `p` is now a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(data[index], p)` appended with `result`.**

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(n, p)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1(n, p)` to the variable `result`. It does not affect the values of `index`, `n`, `t`, `p`, `data`, or `results` directly, except that `index` is increased by `n` due to the precondition. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is equal to `data[index]`, and `p` remains the same list of integers. The `results` list is updated by appending the new `result` to it.
