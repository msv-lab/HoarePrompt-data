Output State: **`index` is 4 + n, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `result`, `p` is now a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `index` remains 4 + n, `n` is still an integer from `data[2]`, `t` must still be greater than 0, `n` is still a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is still a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is still a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, and `p` is still a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`.
