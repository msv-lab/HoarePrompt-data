Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    result = func_1(n, p)
    results.append(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `index` is 4 + n, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `result`, `p` is now a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `index` is 5 + `data[index]` + `data[index]`, `n` is `data[index]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + data[index] - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(data[index], p)` appended with `result`, and `results.append(result)` has been executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `index` is increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is an integer value equal to `data[index]`, `t` is greater than 0, `p` is now a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(data[index], p)` appended with `result`, `results` now contains one additional element which is the latest `result`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
