Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is simply `_` (which is a placeholder variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `index` is 4 + n
   - `n` is an integer from `data[2]`
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`
   - `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `result`
   - `p` is now a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, we need to ensure `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - The other variables (`index`, `n`, `p`, `data`, `results`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is `t - 1` (since `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue)

So, the updated state is:
State: **`index` is 4 + n, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `result`, `p` is now a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`**
