Output State: **`index` is 4 + `n`, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `result`, `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to the integer value of `data[index]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
