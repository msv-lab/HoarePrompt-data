Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `dp[j]` is greater than 0, and `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `j` is set to 1.
- The condition `j - 1 >= 0` is true since `j` is 1.
- The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
- Since `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0. Therefore, `new_dp[0]` is updated to `(new_dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
