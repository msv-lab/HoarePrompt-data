Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `i` is 3, `n` remains at least 1, and `new_dp` is a list of 0s with a length of `2 * n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `new_dp` as a list of zeros with a length of `2 * n + 1`. This means that `new_dp` is now a list filled with zeros, and its length is `2 * n + 1`. The values of `dp`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
