Output State: **`index` is 5 + `data[index]` + `data[index]`, `n` is `data[index]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + data[index] - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(data[index], p)` appended with `result`, and `results.append(result)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. However, since the actual value of `result` is not specified, we only note that the append operation has taken place. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `index` is updated to be `5 + data[index] + data[index]` due to the previous operations.
