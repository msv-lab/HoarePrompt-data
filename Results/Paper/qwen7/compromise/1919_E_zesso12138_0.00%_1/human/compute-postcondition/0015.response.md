Output State: **`index` is 5 + `n`, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `result`, `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was set to `4 + n`. After executing `index += 1`, the new value of `index` becomes `5 + n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
