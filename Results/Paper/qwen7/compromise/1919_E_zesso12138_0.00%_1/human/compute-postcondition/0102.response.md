Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop variable `j` ranges from `0` to `2 * n`. The relevant variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range `[0, 2 * n]`.

3. **Determine the New State of `j`:**
   According to the postcondition, `j` is an integer and equals the previous `j + 1`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.

4. **Determine the New State of `n`:**
   The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.

Given the above analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is the previous `j + 1`, `n` is greater than 0**
