Output State: **`index` is 5 + `n`, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + n` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `result`, `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]**.

Explanation: The code updates the list `p` by converting the elements in the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The other variables remain unchanged except for `n`, which is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
