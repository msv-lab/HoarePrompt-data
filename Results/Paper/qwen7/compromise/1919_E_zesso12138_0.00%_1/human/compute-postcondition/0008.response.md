Output State: **`index` is 4, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is an empty list**

The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 3, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
