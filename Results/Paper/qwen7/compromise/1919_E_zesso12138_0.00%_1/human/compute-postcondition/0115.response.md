Output State: **`final_sum` is `p[-1] + offset`, `i` is `n + 1`, `new_dp` is the final values of `dp` after all iterations, and the `dp` list reflects the cumulative effect of adding adjacent values from the previous state, taken modulo `MOD`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` list will contain the updated values according to the specified rule, `i` will be set to `n + 1`, and `final_sum` will be the sum of the last element of `p` and `offset`. The `new_dp` variable will hold the final state of the `dp` list.
