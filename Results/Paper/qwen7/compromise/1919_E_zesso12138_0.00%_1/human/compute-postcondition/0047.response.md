Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length `2 * n + 1`, and `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, and the current value of `j` satisfies `dp[j] > 0` and `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding the value of `dp[j]` to it and then taking the modulo with `MOD`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
