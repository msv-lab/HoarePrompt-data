Output State: **`j` is the previous `j + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Now, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.**

The code updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
