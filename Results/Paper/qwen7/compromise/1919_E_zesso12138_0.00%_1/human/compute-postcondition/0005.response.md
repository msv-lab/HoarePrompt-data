Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the existing variables (`index`, `t`, `n`, `p`, `data`). Therefore, their states remain the same as the initial state.
