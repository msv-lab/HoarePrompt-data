Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `res` and `results`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `results` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, p)` with one less element.
   - `index` is set to the initial value.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `results`, the variable `res` will be the next element in `results`.
   - After processing the current `res`, the length of `results` will decrease by one (since it was already one element shorter at the end of the previous iteration).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `results` will now have one less element than before.
   - `res` will be the next element in the updated `results` list.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, p)` with two less elements, `index` is set to the initial value, `t` is 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace**.
