Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of initial arrays `a` that result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not accurately simulate the process of generating prefix sums from an array `a` consisting of only 1 and -1.

Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Simulation of Prefix Sums**: The `func_1` function uses dynamic programming to simulate the generation of prefix sums, but it does not correctly handle the transitions between 1 and -1 values. The transitions should reflect the changes in the prefix sums based on the values in `a`, but the current implementation does not properly account for these changes.

2. **Offset Handling**: The offset handling in `func_1` is not appropriate for the problem. The offset is used to shift the indices, but the logic for updating the DP table does not correctly reflect the transitions between 1 and -1 values in the array `a`.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**: The final sum calculation in `func_1` assumes that the last element of `p` directly corresponds to the final position in the DP table, which is not necessarily true without proper simulation of the prefix sums.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  3
  -1 0 0
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  2
  ```

  The two possible arrays `a` that can result in the sorted prefix sum array `p = [-1, 0, 0]` are `[1, -1, 1]` and `[-1, 1, 1]`. However, the provided program does not produce the correct result for this case.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, hence the correctness is **False**.
