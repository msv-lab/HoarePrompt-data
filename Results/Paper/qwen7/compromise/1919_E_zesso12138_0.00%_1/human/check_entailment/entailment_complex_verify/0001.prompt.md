You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), and `p`, a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer's absolute value is less than or equal to `n`. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` and updates it through a series of iterations, where each element in `dp` is updated based on the sum of its adjacent elements from the previous iteration, taken modulo `MOD`. After completing the iterations, it calculates `final_sum` as `p[-1] + offset` and returns the value of `dp` at this index.

#Function 2:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the hidden array and a sorted list of integers, then calls another function `func_1` to compute some result based on these inputs. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies internal variables like `index`, `t`, `p`, and `results` to manage the data across test cases.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of possible initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only 1 and -1 such that the sorted prefix sum array `p` matches the given sorted prefix sum array.
   - The prefix sum array `p` is derived from `a` and then sorted.
   - The result should be returned modulo \(998,244,353\).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function attempts to simulate the process of generating the prefix sum array `p` from `a` and then counting the number of valid `a`.
   - It uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to keep track of the number of ways to reach each possible prefix sum value.
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a single element at the middle point (offset `n`), representing the starting point of the prefix sums.
   - For each position in the prefix sum array, it updates the `dp` array by considering the two possible values that can lead to the current position (i.e., adding 1 or -1).
   - Finally, it returns the value corresponding to the last element of the original prefix sum array `p`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases, the size of the array `n`, and the sorted prefix sum array `p` for each test case.
   - It then calls `func_1` and stores the results.

### Issues and Corrections

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization and Update:**
   - The initialization of `dp` with `[0] * (2 * n + 1)` and setting `dp[n] = 1` is correct.
   - However, the update logic in the loop seems to be incorrect. The function should consider the transitions from the previous state correctly, but the current implementation does not properly handle the transitions between prefix sums.

2. **Prefix Sum Array Generation:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the generation of the prefix sum array `p` from `a`. It should generate the prefix sums and then sort them to match the given `p`.

3. **Counting Valid Arrays:**
   - The function should count the number of valid arrays `a` that produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. This requires a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving combinatorial methods or dynamic programming with careful state transitions.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the current implementation of `func_1` is not correct for solving the problem as described. Therefore, the program as given is incorrect.
