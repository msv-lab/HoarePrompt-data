Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if both `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - A dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with a length of `2 * n + 1`.
   - The offset `n` is set, and `dp[n]` is set to 1, indicating the initial condition.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Update**:
   - The function iterates through each element of `dp` and updates it based on the sum of its adjacent elements from the previous iteration, taking the result modulo `MOD`.
   - This step ensures that the values in `dp` reflect the cumulative effect of adding adjacent values from the previous state, wrapped around the list boundaries using modulo arithmetic.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final sum `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
   - The function returns the value of `dp` at index `final_sum`.

### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function reads the entire input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary values (`n` and `p`) for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate values of `n` and `p`.
   - The result of `func_1` is stored in a list `results`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the function prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:
- The problem requires counting the number of initial arrays `a` such that the sorted prefix sum array `p` matches the given sorted prefix sum array.
- The provided solution uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to achieve the given prefix sum array `p` after sorting.
- The logic in `func_1` seems to correctly simulate the process of generating prefix sums and counting the number of valid initial arrays `a`.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
