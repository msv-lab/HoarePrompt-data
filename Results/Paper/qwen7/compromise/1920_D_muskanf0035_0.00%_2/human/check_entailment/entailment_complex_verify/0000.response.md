### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Analysis of `func_1` Function:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `array` starts as an empty list.
   - `result` starts as an empty list.

2. **Loop through Operations**:
   - For each operation:
     - If `op_type` is 1, append `value` to `array`.
     - If `op_type` is 2, extend `array` by repeating its current content `value` times.
   
3. **After Processing All Operations**:
   - `array` will contain the final state of the array after all operations have been processed.
   - `result` is constructed by taking elements from `array` based on the indices specified in `queries`, modulo the length of `array`.

4. **Issue with Current Implementation**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle the second type of operation (`op_type` == 2).
   - Instead of appending `x` copies of the current array, it simply repeats the entire array `x` times, which is incorrect.

#### Corrected Version:

The original assessment is correct in pointing out the issue. The provided implementation does not correctly simulate the appending of `x` copies of the current array. The corrected version should be:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend(array * value)
    result = []
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

This corrected version correctly handles both types of operations:
- Appending a single integer to the array.
- Extending the array by repeating its current content `x` times.

#### Verification Using Annotated Code:

The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points:
- Initially, `array` is empty.
- After processing all operations, `array` should contain the correct sequence of elements.
- The `result` list is constructed by taking elements from `array` based on the queries, modulo the length of `array`.

Given the corrected implementation, the program now correctly simulates the operations and produces the expected results.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the provided corrected version fixes the issue, making the program correct according to the problem description.
