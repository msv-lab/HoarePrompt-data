### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is flawed in how it handles the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations. Specifically, the modulo operation `((k - 1) % len(array))` only considers the current length of the array, which does not reflect the actual structure of the array after repeated extensions. This leads to incorrect results for large values of `k`.

To validate or challenge the original assessment, let's re-evaluate the function `func_1` and the overall program:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Type 1 Operation:** Correctly appends the value to the array.
   - **Type 2 Operation:** Correctly extends the array by repeating the current array `x` times.
   - **Query Handling:** The issue lies in the way the `k-th` element is determined. The modulo operation `((k - 1) % len(array))` returns an index within the current length of the array, but it does not account for the nested structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations. This means that for large values of `k`, the result will be incorrect.

2. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the example provided:
     - After the first type 1 operation, `array = [1]`.
     - After the second type 1 operation, `array = [1, 2]`.
     - After the third type 2 operation, `array = [1, 2, 1, 2]`.
     - After the fourth type 1 operation, `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.
     - After the fifth type 2 operation, `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.

   - For `k = 14`, the expected result is `2`, but the function returns `2` because `14 % 20 == 14`, and the 14th element in the current array is `2`. However, the actual structure of the array shows that the 14th element is part of the second repetition of the sub-array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`, which means the correct answer should be `3`.

   - Similarly, for `k = 15`, the expected result is `3`, but the function returns `3` because `15 % 20 == 15`, and the 15th element in the current array is `3`. However, the actual structure of the array shows that the 15th element is part of the third repetition of the sub-array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`, which means the correct answer should be `3`.

   - For `k = 16`, the expected result is `1`, but the function returns `1` because `16 % 20 == 16`, and the 16th element in the current array is `1`. However, the actual structure of the array shows that the 16th element is part of the fourth repetition of the sub-array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`, which means the correct answer should be `1`.

Therefore, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations, leading to incorrect results for large values of `k`.

### Final Evaluation

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the structure of the array after multiple type 2 operations.
