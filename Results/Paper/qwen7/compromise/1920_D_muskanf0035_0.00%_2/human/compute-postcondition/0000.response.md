Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, `operations` is a list of n lists, each containing two integers b and x where b ∈ {1, 2}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and `queries` is a list of q integers k_i such that 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after performing all n operations.**

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `t`. The values of `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` remain unchanged from their initial state.
