Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each of the `m` rounds can have at least one problem of each difficulty level. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the number of rounds `m` might require more problems than just ensuring each difficulty level appears at least once.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
10 2
BGECDCBDED
```

In this case, the program will output `2`, but the correct answer should be `4`. Here's why:

- The bank has 10 problems: B, G, E, C, D, C, B, D, E, D.
- To hold 2 rounds, we need at least 2 problems of each difficulty level ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G').

The current implementation only checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m` and adds the difference to the answer. However, it does not ensure that the total count of problems for each difficulty level is sufficient for `m` rounds.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the count of each difficulty level is at least `m`. If any difficulty level is missing, the program should add the necessary number of problems for that level.
