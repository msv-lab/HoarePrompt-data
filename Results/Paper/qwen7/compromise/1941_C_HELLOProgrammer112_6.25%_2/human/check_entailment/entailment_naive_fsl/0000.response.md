Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. It simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum, which does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions. For example, in the input "mmapnapie", the program would output 2, but removing only the 4th character ('a') would make the string beautiful, requiring only 1 deletion instead of 2.
