Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

2. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The expression `(1 << size + 1) - 1` represents a number that is \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\).
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` must be true.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `size` is 1.
   - `number` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq number \leq 1000\).
   - `sequence` is a list of integers where each element is within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

4. **Calculate the value of the loop condition**:
   - When `size` is 1, `(1 << size + 1) - 1` becomes `(1 << 2) - 1 = 3`.
   - Therefore, the condition simplifies to `3 <= number`.

5. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `number` must be at least 3 because the smallest possible value for the left-hand side of the inequality is 3.
   - Since `number` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, we need to ensure that `number` is at least 3.

6. **Final state before the loop**:
   - `size` remains 1.
   - `number` must be at least 3.
   - `sequence` does not affect the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be:

**State: `size` is 1, `number` must be at least 3**
