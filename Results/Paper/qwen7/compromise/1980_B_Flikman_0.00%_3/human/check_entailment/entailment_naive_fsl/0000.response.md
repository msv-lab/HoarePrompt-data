Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining whether the favorite cube will be removed is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
- Expected Output: `MAYBE`
- Program Output: `YES`

Hereâ€™s why the program fails:
- The favorite cube (index 2) shows the value 3.
- After sorting, the array becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
- The first two elements are `[4, 3]`, so the favorite cube could end up in the second or third position after sorting.
- If the favorite cube ends up in the second position, it will be removed because `k = 2`.
- If the favorite cube ends up in the third position, it will not be removed because only the first two cubes are removed.

However, the program incorrectly prints `YES` because it checks if the number of cubes greater than the favorite value plus the number of cubes with the same value is less than or equal to `k`. This condition is not sufficient to determine the outcome in all cases.

To correctly implement the logic, we need to check the exact position of the favorite cube after sorting and ensure that it falls within the range of indices that are removed.
