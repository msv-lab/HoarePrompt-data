Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `greater_count` is 0, `same_value_count` is equal to the total number of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f-1` in the list `a`, `n` retains its original value, `f` retains its original value, `k` retains its original value, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `t` remains unchanged, `_` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value > favorite_value:
        greater_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `value` is compared with `favorite_value`. If `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, `greater_count` is increased by 1. Since there is no else part, the value of `greater_count` is only affected when the condition is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `value` is an element of the list `a`, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and if `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, then `greater_count` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `value` is an element of the list `a`, `a` must have at least 2 elements, and `greater_count` is increased by 1 if `value` is greater than `favorite_value`. Otherwise, `greater_count` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
