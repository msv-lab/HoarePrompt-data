Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 0, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers inputted from the user, `a_i` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `_` is still 0. The list `a_i` is not modified and remains an empty list.
