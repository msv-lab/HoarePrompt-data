Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `same_value_count` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 0, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers inputted from the user, `a_i` is a list containing integers inputted from the user, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in the list `a_i`.
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value == favorite_value:
        same_value_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least one element, and `same_value_count` is incremented by 1 if the given `value` equals `favorite_value`. If `value` does not equal `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least one element, and if `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is incremented by 1. If `value` is not equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least one element, and `value` is the next element from the list `a`. If `value` equals `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` is increased by 1. If `value` does not equal `favorite_value`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
