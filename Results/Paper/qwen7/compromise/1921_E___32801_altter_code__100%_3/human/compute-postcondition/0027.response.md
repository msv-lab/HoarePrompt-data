Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is one more than its original value, `y1` is one less than its original value, `y2` is the same as the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is always greater than `x1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`.**

Explanation: The code `b = x2 - x1` calculates the difference between `x2` and `x1` and assigns it to `b`. No other variables are affected. The values of `t`, `r`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, and `y2` remain unchanged from their initial states. `x2` is still greater than `x1`, and `b` is now the value of `x2 - x1`.
