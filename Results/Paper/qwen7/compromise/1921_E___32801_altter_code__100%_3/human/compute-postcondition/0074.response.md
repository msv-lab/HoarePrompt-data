Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` plus `a`, `y1` is 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` minus `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x1` is less than or equal to `x2`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, `x2` is less than or equal to `n`, and `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`.**

In this output state, the value of `y1` has been explicitly set to 1, while all other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
