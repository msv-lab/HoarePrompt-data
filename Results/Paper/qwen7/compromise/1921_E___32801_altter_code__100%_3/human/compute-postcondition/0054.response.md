Postcondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is the third element of r, y1 is the fourth element of r, x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the sixth element of r, and (x2 - x1) % 2 == 0. The current value of y1 is equal to y2.**
