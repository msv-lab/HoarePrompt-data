Output State: **`r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is two more than its original value, `y1` is one less than its original value, `y2` is now equal to `m`, `x2` is always greater than `x1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, and `(x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n)` and `y2 > y1`.**

Explanation: The code `y2 = m` updates the value of `y2` to be equal to `m`. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, `y2` is now `m`, and the rest of the conditions and values stay as they were described in the initial state.
