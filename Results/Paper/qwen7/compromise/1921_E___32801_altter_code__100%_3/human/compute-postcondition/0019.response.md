Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each part to an integer.
- `n` is the first element of `r`.
- `m` is the second element of `r`.
- `x1` and `x2` are elements of `r`.
- `y1` and `y2` are elements of `r`.

From the conditions:
- `y1` is equal to `y2`.
- `x1` is one more than its original value.
- `y1` is one less than its original value.
- `y2` remains the same.

The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
