### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions and initial positions of Alice and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Conditions Check:**
   - The program checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints 'Draw' and returns, which is correct because Bob is already in the first row and cannot move further up.

3. **Odd Difference Check:**
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`, it means the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is odd.
     - If `y1 == y2`, Alice can always win by moving diagonally towards Bob, so it prints 'Alice'.
     - Otherwise, the program attempts to simulate moves to see if Alice can force a win. However, the logic here seems overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

4. **Even Difference Check:**
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, it means the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is even.
     - If `y1 == y2`, Bob can always win by moving towards Alice, so it prints 'Bob'.
     - Otherwise, the program again attempts to simulate moves to see if Bob can force a win. Again, the logic seems overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

5. **Simulated Moves:**
   - The program simulates moves by adjusting the positions of Alice and Bob and checking if Alice or Bob can force a win.
   - The logic for determining if a player can force a win seems to involve calculating distances and checking if certain conditions are met, but the implementation is not straightforward and may contain errors.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Edge Cases:
- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - The program does not explicitly handle boundary conditions for Alice and Bob. For example, if Alice reaches the bottom row (last row) or Bob reaches the top row (first row), the game should end in a draw. The current logic does not account for these scenarios.

- **Diagonal Moves:**
  - The program attempts to simulate diagonal moves but does not handle all possible diagonal paths correctly. For instance, if Alice and Bob are close to the boundary, the current logic might not correctly determine if Alice can force a win.

- **General Strategy:**
  - The logic for determining if a player can force a win is overly complex and may not cover all edge cases. For example, the condition `b // 2 > a and abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c` is not sufficient to guarantee a win in all scenarios.

### Correctness:
- **Incorrect Handling of Boundary Conditions:**
  - The program does not correctly handle scenarios where Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board. This leads to incorrect outcomes in many cases.

- **Complexity and Overlap:**
  - The logic for determining if a player can force a win is overly complex and may not cover all edge cases. The current implementation might lead to incorrect results in some scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the game rules and does not handle all edge cases properly. Therefore, the program is likely incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
