### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions and initial positions of Alice and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Conditions Check:**
   - The program checks if `x2 <= x1`. If true, it prints 'Draw' and returns, which is correct because Bob is already in the first row and cannot move further up.

3. **Odd Difference Check:**
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`, it means the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is odd.
     - If `y1 == y2`, Alice can always win by moving diagonally towards Bob, so it prints 'Alice'.
     - Otherwise, the program attempts to simulate moves to see if Alice can force a win. However, the logic here seems overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

4. **Even Difference Check:**
   - If `(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`, it means the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is even.
     - If `y1 == y2`, Bob can always win by moving towards Alice, so it prints 'Bob'.
     - Otherwise, the program again attempts to simulate moves to see if Bob can force a win. Again, the logic seems overly complex and may not cover all edge cases.

5. **Simulated Moves:**
   - The program simulates moves by adjusting the positions of Alice and Bob and checking if Alice or Bob can force a win.
   - The logic for determining if a player can force a win seems to involve calculating distances and checking if certain conditions are met, but the implementation is not straightforward and may contain errors.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it does not correctly handle scenarios where Alice or Bob is on the boundary of the board.
  - The logic for determining if a player can force a win is overly complex and may not be correct in all scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the game rules and does not handle all edge cases properly. Therefore, the program is likely incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
