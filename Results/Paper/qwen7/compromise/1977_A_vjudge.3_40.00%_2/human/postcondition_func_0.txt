The function processes a series of test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions. Specifically, it prints 'Yes' if `n` equals `m`, `m` is greater than `n` by exactly 1, both `n` and `m` are even, or both `n` and `m` are odd; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes with a series of 'Yes' and 'No' outputs corresponding to the conditions evaluated for each pair of `n` and `m`.
