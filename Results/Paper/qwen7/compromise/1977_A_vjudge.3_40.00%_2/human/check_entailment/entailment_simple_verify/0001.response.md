### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes, respectively.

2. **Conditions for "Yes":**
   - If `n == m`, it means that Nikita can simply add one cube at a time for `n` moves, resulting in `m` cubes. This condition is correctly handled.
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves, so the answer should be "No". This condition is also correctly handled.
   - If `m == n - 1`, Nikita can add one cube at a time for `n-1` moves and then remove one cube, resulting in `m` cubes. This condition is correctly handled.
   - If both `n` and `m` are even, Nikita can add and remove cubes in such a way that he ends up with `m` cubes. This condition is correctly handled.
   - If both `n` and `m` are odd, Nikita can also achieve `m` cubes through a combination of adding and removing cubes. This condition is correctly handled.

3. **Conditions for "No":**
   - All other cases where the conditions above do not match should result in "No". However, there is an issue in the logic. Specifically, the condition `elif m == n - 1:` is redundant because it is already covered by the general logic of adding and removing cubes. Also, the condition `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` and `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` are unnecessary and can be simplified.

4. **Simplified Logic:**
   - The program can be simplified to:
     ```python
     def func():
         t = int(input())
         for i in range(t):
             (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
             if n == m or (m == n - 1):
                 print('Yes')
             else:
                 print('No')
     ```
   - The conditions `if m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` and `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` are redundant because they are already covered by the general logic of checking if `n` and `m` are both even or both odd.

5. **Validation Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the program processes each test case correctly and prints "Yes" or "No" based on the conditions.
   - The state transitions described in the annotations match the expected behavior of the program.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original program handles all necessary conditions correctly but includes redundant checks. After simplifying the logic, the program still works as intended.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly handles all the necessary conditions and can be simplified without changing its functionality.
