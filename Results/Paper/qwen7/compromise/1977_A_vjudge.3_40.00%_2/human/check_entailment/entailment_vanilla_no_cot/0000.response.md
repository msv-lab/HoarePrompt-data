Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in its conditions. Specifically, the conditions for printing 'Yes' when `m` is less than `n` and both `m` and `n` are even or odd need to be more carefully considered.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Case where `n == m`:** This is correctly handled by printing "Yes".
2. **Case where `m > n`:** This is correctly identified as impossible, so "No" is printed.
3. **Case where `m == n - 1`:** This is also correctly identified as possible because Nikita can add and remove cubes to achieve this state.
4. **Case where `m` and `n` are both even or both odd:** This condition should not be used as a separate check. Instead, the key point is whether the difference between `n` and `m` is even. If the difference (`n - m`) is even, it means that the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in `m` cubes. Therefore, the correct condition should be `abs(n - m) % 2 == 0`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif abs(n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly handles all edge cases and provides the right output based on the problem statement.
