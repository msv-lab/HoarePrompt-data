Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' and 'No' responses based on the conditions evaluated in the loop for each pair of integers (n, m) entered during the iterations. Specifically, it will print 'Yes' if n equals m, if m is one less than n, if both n and m are even, or if both n and m are odd. Otherwise, it will print 'No'. The number of lines in the output will be equal to the value of t, which was initially assigned an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
