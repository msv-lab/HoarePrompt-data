Output State: The output state will consist of 10 lines, each containing two integers separated by a space. For each iteration `i` from 0 to 9, if the value at index `i` in list `x` is less than the value at index `i` in list `y`, the line will print `x[i]` followed by `y[i]`. Otherwise, it will print `y[i]` followed by `x[i]`.

For example, if `x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` and `y = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, the output would be:

```
1 10
2 9
3 8
4 7
5 6
6 5
7 4
8 3
9 2
10 1
```
