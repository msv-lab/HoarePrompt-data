Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `y` as an empty list, which does not affect the values of `t` or `x`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` remains an empty list, and `y` becomes an empty list.
