Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and splits it into a list of integers. This list is then assigned to the variable `nums`. The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `x` is now the maximum value in the list `nums` and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.
