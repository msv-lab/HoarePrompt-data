Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `e` is 0.
   - `l` is the length of the list `nums`.
   - `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`.
   - `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for e in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `e = 0` to `e < t`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `e`.
   - Since the loop starts with `e = 0` and increments `e` by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `e < t`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `e` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `e` should be set to 1.

6. **Other Variables:**
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `l` remains unchanged.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `y` remains unchanged.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `e` should be 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `l`, `x`, `y`) remain the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 1, `l` is the length of the list `nums`, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.**
