Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where t is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and for each test case, n is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function returns different outputs based on the input data.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases defined by the values of t and n, along with a list of n integers, and processes this input data according to its logic. However, since the specific logic for processing the data is not provided, the focus here is on describing the nature and constraints of the input data.
