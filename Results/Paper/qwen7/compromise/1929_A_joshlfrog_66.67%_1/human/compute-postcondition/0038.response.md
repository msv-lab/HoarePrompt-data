Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, `nums` is a list of integers created from user input.**

The code sets `y` to the value 100000000. This changes the value of `y` but does not affect the values of `t`, `e`, `l`, `x`, or `nums`. Therefore, the other variables retain their initial states.
