Output State: **`l` is a positive integer and at least 1, `x` remains the value of `nums[0]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `y` is `nums[i]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `y`. This does not affect the values of `l`, `x`, or `i`. The variable `y` now holds the value of `nums[i]`.
