Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of subsequent test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It finds the maximum and minimum values in the list of integers and prints the difference between these two values. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
