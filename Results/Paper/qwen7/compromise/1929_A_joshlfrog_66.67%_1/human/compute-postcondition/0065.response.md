Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, variable `x` will hold the maximum value found in the list `nums`, and `y` will hold the minimum value found in the list `nums`. The variable `l` will be equal to the length of the list `nums`, and `i` will be equal to `l - 1` (since the loop increments `i` at each iteration until it reaches the length of `nums`).**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will contain the largest number in the list `nums`, `y` will contain the smallest number in the list `nums`, `l` will be the total number of elements in `nums`, and `i` will point to the last index of the list `nums`.
