Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `l` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list, `x` will hold the maximum value found in the `nums` list, and `y` will hold the minimum value found in the `nums` list.

This means that `l` will reflect the total number of elements in the `nums` list, `x` will be the largest number among all elements in the list, and `y` will be the smallest number among all elements in the list.
