Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `e` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is 0.**

The code initializes `x` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `e`, `l`, or `nums`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
