Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `l-1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < l`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l` is a positive integer and at least 1.
   - `x` holds the value of `nums[i]`.
   - If `nums[i]` is less than `y`, then `y` is set to `nums[i]`. Otherwise, the values of `l` and `x` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `l-1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been `l-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `l`, but since `i` starts from `0` and goes up to `l-1`, the next valid value for `i` is `0` if `l > 1`, otherwise, the loop will terminate.
   - Therefore, `i` will be reset to `0` for the next iteration.
   - `l` remains unchanged because the loop condition is based on `i < l`, and `l` is not modified within the loop.
   - `x` will hold the value of `nums[0]` for the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `l` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `x` will now hold the value of `nums[0]` for the next iteration.
   - There is no change to `y` as it is not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`l` is a positive integer and at least 1, `x` holds the value of `nums[0]`**.
