Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `l` is greater than 0
   - If `nums[0]` is less than `y`, then `y` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `y` is `nums[0]`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop condition is `range(l)`, meaning the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i < l`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop runs as long as `i < l`, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - The condition `l > 0` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

4. **Considering the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if `nums[0]` is less than `y`, `y` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `y` is set to `nums[0]`.
   - This means `y` might change or remain the same depending on the value of `nums[0]`.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `l` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `y` could either remain the same or be updated to `nums[0]` based on the condition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 1
- `l` must still be greater than 0
- `y` could either remain the same or be updated to `nums[0]`

However, since we are asked to provide a specific state without knowing the exact value of `y`, we can generalize it as follows:

**State: **`i` is 1, `l` is greater than 0, `y` is either the same as before or `nums[0]`**
