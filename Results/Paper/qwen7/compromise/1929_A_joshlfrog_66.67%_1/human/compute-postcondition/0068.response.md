Output State: **`l` is an input integer**.

The code `l = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `l`. All other variables remain in their initial state, meaning they are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `l` now holds the integer value entered by the user.
