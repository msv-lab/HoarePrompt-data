Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 0, `l` is the length of the list `nums`, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the list `nums`. During each iteration, the variable `x` is updated to be the maximum value encountered so far, and `y` is updated to be the minimum value encountered so far. After all iterations, `x` will hold the maximum value in the list, and `y` will hold the minimum value in the list. The other variables (`t`, `e`, and `l`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
