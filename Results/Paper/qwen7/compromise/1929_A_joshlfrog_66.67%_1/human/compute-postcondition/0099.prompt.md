Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for e in range(t):
    l = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    x = 0
    y = 100000000
    for i in range(l):
        if nums[i] > x:
            x = nums[i]
        if nums[i] < y:
            y = nums[i]
    print(x - y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 0, `l` is the length of the list `nums`, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.

Explanation: 
- The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) as it was initially set.
- The variable `e` remains 0 as there is no operation that changes it.
- The variable `l` is set to the length of the list `nums` when the loop starts.
- The variable `x` is updated during each iteration to hold the maximum value encountered in the list `nums`.
- The variable `y` is updated during each iteration to hold the minimum value encountered in the list `nums`.

After all iterations of the loop, `x` will contain the highest value in the list `nums`, and `y` will contain the lowest value in the list `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all its iterations, variable `x` will hold the maximum value found in the list `nums`, and `y` will hold the minimum value found in the list `nums`. The variable `l` will be equal to the length of the list `nums`, and `i` will be equal to `l - 1` (since the loop increments `i` at each iteration until it reaches the length of `nums`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The variable `i` is equal to `l-1`, `l` is greater than 0, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
