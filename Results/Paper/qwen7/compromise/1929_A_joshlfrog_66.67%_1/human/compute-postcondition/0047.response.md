Output State: **`l` is a positive integer and at least 1, `x` holds the value of `nums[i]`, `y` is equal to `nums[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. The values of `l` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `l` remains a positive integer and at least 1, `x` still holds the value of `nums[i]`, and `y` is now equal to `nums[i]`.
