You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of subsequent test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It finds the maximum and minimum values in the list of integers and prints the difference between these two values. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `l` and the array elements `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two variables `x` and `y` are initialized. `x` is set to `0`, and `y` is set to `100000000` (a large number).

3. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Values:**
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and updates `x` to be the maximum value encountered so far.
   - Simultaneously, it updates `y` to be the minimum value encountered so far.

4. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - After the loop, the program calculates the difference `x - y` and prints it.

### Reasoning:

- The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
- To maximize this sum, we should arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
- The maximum possible difference between two numbers in the array is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.
- Therefore, setting `x` to the maximum value and `y` to the minimum value in the array and calculating `x - y` gives us the maximum possible beauty.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Test Case 1:** `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Maximum value (`x`) = 3
  - Minimum value (`y`) = 1
  - Beauty = `3 - 1 = 2`
  - The program correctly outputs `2`.

- **Test Case 2:** `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Maximum value (`x`) = 69
  - Minimum value (`y`) = 69
  - Beauty = `69 - 69 = 0`
  - The program correctly outputs `0`.

- **Test Case 3:** `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Maximum value (`x`) = 100
  - Minimum value (`y`) = 43
  - Beauty = `100 - 43 = 57`
  - The program correctly outputs `57`.

- **Test Case 4:** `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Maximum value (`x`) = 4
  - Minimum value (`y`) = 3
  - Beauty = `4 - 3 = 1`
  - The program correctly outputs `1`.

- **Test Case 5:** `[2, 1]`
  - Maximum value (`x`) = 2
  - Minimum value (`y`) = 1
  - Beauty = `2 - 1 = 1`
  - The program correctly outputs `1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. Therefore, the given program is correct.
