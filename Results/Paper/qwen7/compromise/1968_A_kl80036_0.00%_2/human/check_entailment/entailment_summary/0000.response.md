Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to check if the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, we need to verify if the program finds an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.

Let's analyze the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
3. It calculates \( y = x // 2 \) and prints \( y \).

Now, let's consider the condition \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) being maximized:
- If \( y = x // 2 \), then \(\gcd(x, y)\) will be at least 1 (since \( x \) and \( x // 2 \) share at least the factor 1).
- However, this choice of \( y \) does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). For example, if \( x = 10 \), then \( y = 5 \) gives \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\). But if \( y = 2 \), then \(\gcd(10, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4\), which is smaller. However, if \( y = 1 \), then \(\gcd(10, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\), which is even smaller.

In general, choosing \( y = x // 2 \) does not guarantee that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. There could be other values of \( y \) that yield a higher sum.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
