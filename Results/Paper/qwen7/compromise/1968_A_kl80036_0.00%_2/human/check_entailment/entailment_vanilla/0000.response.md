### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program takes an integer \( t \) as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then calculates \( y \) as \( \frac{x}{2} \) and prints this value.
3. **Evaluation of the Approach**:
   - The approach taken by the program is to set \( y \) to \( \frac{x}{2} \). This means \( y \) will be \( \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \).
   - However, this approach does not necessarily maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Example Analysis:
- For \( x = 10 \):
  - \( y = 5 \)
  - \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \)
  - But, \( y = 9 \) would give \( \gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10 \), which is the same but \( y = 9 \) is closer to the boundary condition.
- For \( x = 21 \):
  - \( y = 10 \)
  - \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11 \)
  - But, \( y = 18 \) would give \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21 \), which is better.

From these examples, we see that \( y = \frac{x}{2} \) does not always yield the maximum value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the chosen \( y \) maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
