Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all scenarios, particularly when the promotion price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than half the regular price of one yogurt (`B/2`). The logic in the `if` and `else` statements does not fully account for the optimal way to minimize the cost.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

1. Calculate the cost if all yogurts were bought individually.
2. Calculate the cost if pairs of yogurts are bought using the promotion.
3. Calculate the cost if the last yogurt is bought individually after buying as many pairs as possible with the promotion.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Cost if all yogurts are bought individually
        individual_cost = n * a
        
        # Number of pairs that can be bought
        pairs = n // 2
        # Remaining yogurts after buying pairs
        remaining = n % 2
        
        # Cost if pairs are bought with promotion
        promotion_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        
        # The minimum cost will be the lower of the two costs
        print(min(individual_cost, promotion_cost))
```

This corrected function ensures that the minimum cost is calculated by considering both the individual purchase and the promotional purchase options.
