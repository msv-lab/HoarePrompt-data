Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer input from the user, `q` is an integer input from the user**.

Explanation: The code `k, q = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `k` and `q` respectively. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
