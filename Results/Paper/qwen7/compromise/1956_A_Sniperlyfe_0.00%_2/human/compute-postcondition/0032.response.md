Output State: **`res` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for every `n` in `qs`, `t` is decreased by 1, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `k` and `q` from input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `k` and `q` are assigned the values of the first and second integers entered by the user, respectively. The values of `res` and `t` remain unchanged from their previous states.
