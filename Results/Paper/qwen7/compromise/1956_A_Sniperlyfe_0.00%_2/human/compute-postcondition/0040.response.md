Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `n` is the second element of `qs`, `res` is a list with two elements where the first element is the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the second element is also the result of `func_1(n, p)`.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Initially, `res` contains one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`. After executing `res.append(func_1(n, p))`, `res` now contains two elements, both being the result of `func_1(n, p)`. The values of `qs` and `n` remain unchanged.
