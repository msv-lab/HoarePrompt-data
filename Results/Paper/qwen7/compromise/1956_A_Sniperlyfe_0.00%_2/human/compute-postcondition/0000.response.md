Output State: **`k` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `p` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 <= `p[0]` < `p[1]` < ... < `p[k-1]` <= 100, `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers where 1 <= `qs[i]` <= 100 for all 0 <= `i` < `q`, `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain unchanged from their initial state.
