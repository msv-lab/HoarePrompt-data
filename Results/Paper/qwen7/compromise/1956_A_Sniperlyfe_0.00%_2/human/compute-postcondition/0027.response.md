Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for n in qs`. The variables involved in the loop head are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are values left in `qs`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` now contains the return value of `func_1(res[0], p)` appended to its previous contents.
   - `n` is the next value from `qs`.
   - `qs` must still have at least one value remaining.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `n` will be updated to the next value from `qs` in the next iteration.
   - `qs` will be updated to the remaining elements in the list after removing the current `n`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `res` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop head.
- `n` will be the next value from `qs`.
- `qs` will have one less element than it had at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`res` now contains the return value of `func_1(res[0], p)` appended to its previous contents, `n` is the next value from `qs`, and `qs` must have at least one value remaining (one less than before).**

State: **`res` now contains the return value of `func_1(res[0], p)` appended to its previous contents, `n` is the next value from `qs`, and `qs` must have at least one value remaining (one less than before)**.
