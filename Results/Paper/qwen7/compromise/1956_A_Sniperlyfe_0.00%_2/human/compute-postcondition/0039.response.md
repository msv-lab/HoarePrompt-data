Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for n in qs:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input and must have at least one element.
   - `n` is the first element of `qs`.
   - `res` is a list with one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `qs`.
   - In the previous iteration, `n` was the first element of `qs`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `n` is being reassigned to the next element in `qs` in each iteration, `n` will now be the second element of `qs`.
   - `qs` remains the same list but now `n` refers to the second element of `qs`.

5. **Ensure the loop condition is met**:
   - For the loop to continue, `qs` must still have at least one element (since it is a list and we are iterating through it).

6. **Update the state**:
   - `qs` remains a list of integers with at least one element.
   - `n` is now the second element of `qs`.
   - `res` is unchanged as it was determined by the previous value of `n`.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`qs` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `n` is the second element of `qs`, `res` is a list with one element which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`**.
