Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
- `n` is the third element of `qs`.
- `res` is a list with three elements where the first two elements are the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the third element is also the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `res` is a list with three elements.
2. The first two elements of `res` are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
3. The third element of `res` is also the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Let's denote the result of `func_1(n, p)` as `result`.

So, `res` would look like this:
```python
res = [result, result, result]
```

When `map(str, res)` is applied, it converts each element of `res` to a string. Therefore, `res` becomes:
```python
['result', 'result', 'result']
```

Then, `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these strings with a space in between, resulting in:
```
result result result
```

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **result result result**
