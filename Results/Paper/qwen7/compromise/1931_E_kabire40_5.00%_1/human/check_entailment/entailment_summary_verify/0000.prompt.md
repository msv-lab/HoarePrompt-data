You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
def func():
    for y in range(int(input())):
        rev_val = []
        rev_res = ''
        (list_len, max_power) = input().split()
        operational_list = input().split()
        for x in operational_list:
            x_rev = int(x[::-1])
            if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
                rev_res = rev_res + x
            else:
                rev_val.append(x[::-1])
        rev_val.sort()
        for x in range(len(rev_val)):
            if x % 2 == 0:
                val_in = int(rev_val[x])
                rev_res += str(val_in)
            else:
                val_in = rev_val[x]
                rev_res += val_in[::-1]
        if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers (list length and maximum power) and a list of integers. It reverses each integer in the list, sorts the reversed integers, and then constructs a new string by concatenating every even-indexed reversed integer and the reverse of every odd-indexed reversed integer. Finally, it compares this constructed string (interpreted as an integer) with \(10^{max\_power}\), printing 'Sasha' if the constructed string is greater, and 'Anna' otherwise. This process is repeated for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the game logic correctly. Specifically, the program does not simulate the turns of Anna and Sasha as described in the problem statement. Instead, it reverses the digits of all numbers in the list and then concatenates them in a specific order, which does not reflect the game rules.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Game Logic Not Implemented**: The program does not allow Anna to reverse a single digit in her turn. According to the problem, Anna must choose an element and reverse its digits. However, the program reverses all digits of all numbers in the list.

2. **Concatenation Logic**: The program concatenates the reversed numbers in a specific order, but it does not simulate Sasha’s turn where he needs to remove two elements and concatenate them. The program simply concatenates all reversed numbers without considering the removal of two elements.

3. **Win Condition Check**: The program checks if the resulting number is greater than \(10^m\) after Anna’s turn, but this is not how the game works. The game continues until Sasha cannot make a move, and the final number is checked against \(10^m\).

To correctly implement the game, the program should:
- Allow Anna to reverse a single number in her turn.
- Allow Sasha to remove two numbers and concatenate them in his turn.
- Continue the game until Sasha cannot make a move.
- Check the final number against \(10^m\) to determine the winner.

Since the provided program does not implement the game logic as described, it is incorrect.
