Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the rules and logic of the game described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `y`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the list `list_len` and the parameter `max_power`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `operational_list`.

2. **Reversing Digits:**
   - The program iterates over each integer in `operational_list`.
   - It reverses the digits of each integer and stores the result in `x_rev`.
   - If the length of the reversed integer is the same as the original integer, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_res` without modification.
   - Otherwise, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Constructing Result:**
   - The `rev_val` list is sorted.
   - The program constructs `rev_res` by alternating between elements of `rev_val` and their reversed forms.

4. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the constructed string `rev_res` is greater than or equal to \(10^{max_power}\).
   - If true, it prints 'Sasha'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Anna'.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Handling of Reversed Digits:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the reversal of digits. Specifically, it should convert the reversed string back to an integer before comparing it with \(10^{max_power}\). The current implementation concatenates strings, which does not yield the correct numerical comparison.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Alternating Elements:**
   - The program alternates between elements of `rev_val` and their reversed forms, but it should instead alternate between reversing and not reversing based on the turn (Anna's and Sasha's).

3. **Game Rules Not Fully Implemented:**
   - The program does not simulate the full game where players take turns. Instead, it performs a single transformation and checks the result.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program that properly implements the game rules:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (list_len, max_power) = map(int, input().split())
        operational_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Anna's turn: reverse digits of each element
        reversed_list = [str(num)[::-1] for num in operational_list]
        
        # Sasha's turn: concatenate pairs of elements
        while len(reversed_list) > 1:
            a = reversed_list.pop(0)
            b = reversed_list.pop(0)
            reversed_list.append(int(a + b))
        
        # Check if Sasha wins
        if int(reversed_list[0]) >= 10 ** max_power:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
