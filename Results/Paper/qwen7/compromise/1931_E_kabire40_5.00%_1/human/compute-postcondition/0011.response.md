Postcondition: `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of `x` (`'x_reversed'`), `rev_res` is either the original string `x` or an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input and must not be empty, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`, and the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is either equal to or not equal to the length of the original string `x`.
