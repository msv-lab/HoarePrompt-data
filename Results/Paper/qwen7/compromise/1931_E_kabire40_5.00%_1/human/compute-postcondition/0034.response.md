Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `rev_val`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `x` is less than `len(rev_val)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `len(rev_val)` must be greater than 0.
   - `x` is 0.

4. **Determine the next value of `x`**: Since `x` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `x` will be 1.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `x` must be less than `len(rev_val)`. Given that `x` is now 1, the condition will depend on the length of `rev_val`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `x` will be incremented to 1.
   - `len(rev_val)` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`len(rev_val)` must be greater than 0, `x` is 1**
