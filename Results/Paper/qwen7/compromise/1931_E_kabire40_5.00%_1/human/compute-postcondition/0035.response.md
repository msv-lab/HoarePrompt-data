Output State: **`len(rev_val)` must be greater than 0; `x` is 1; `val_in` is an integer from `rev_val[1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `rev_val[x]` (where `x` is 1) to the variable `val_in` and converts it to an integer using `int()`. Since `x` is 1, `val_in` will be the integer value of `rev_val[1]`. The precondition that `len(rev_val)` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
