Output State: **`rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string, `x` is incremented by 1, `val_in` is the element from `rev_val` at index `x`.**

Explanation: The code `val_in = rev_val[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of the list `rev_val` to the variable `val_in`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `rev_val` is still a non-empty list, `rev_res` is still a string, and `x` is incremented by 1.
