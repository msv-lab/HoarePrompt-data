Output State: **`x` is an integer equal to 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `max_power` is less than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The line `rev_res = ''` sets `rev_res` to an empty string. All other variables (`x`, `rev_val`, and `max_power`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
