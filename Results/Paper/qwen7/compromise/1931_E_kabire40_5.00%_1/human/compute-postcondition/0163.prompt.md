Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed forms of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed form has a different length than the original element.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string. If the index `x` is even, `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` concatenated with the string representation of the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`. If the index `x` is odd, `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus the reverse of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is an integer extracted from `rev_val` at index `x`, and `x` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` with the value of the element at index `x-1` in `rev_val` reversed and appended to it, and `x` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` concatenated with the string representation of the integer obtained from converting `rev_val[x]` to an integer. Otherwise, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` plus the reverse of the element from `rev_val` at index `x`. In both cases, `x` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
