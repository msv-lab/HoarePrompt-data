Postcondition: `rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is an integer extracted from `rev_val` at index `x`, and `x` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` with the value of the element at index `x-1` in `rev_val` reversed and appended to it, and `x` is incremented by 1.
