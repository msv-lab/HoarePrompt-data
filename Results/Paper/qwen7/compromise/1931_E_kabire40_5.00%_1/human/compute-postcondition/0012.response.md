Postcondition: `rev_val` is either an empty list or a list containing the reversed string of `x` ('x_reversed'), `rev_res` is either the original string `x` or an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input and must not be empty, and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the original string `x`, `rev_val` remains empty and `rev_res` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` contains `'x_reversed'` and `rev_res` remains an empty string.
