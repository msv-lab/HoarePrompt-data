Postcondition: **`x` is an integer equal to `len(rev_val)`, `rev_val` remains unchanged as a list, and `rev_res` is a string. For each index `i` in `rev_val`: if `i` is even, the string representation of `rev_val[i]` is appended to `rev_res`; if `i` is odd, the reverse of `rev_val[i]` is concatenated to `rev_res`. The condition `(10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res))` is satisfied.**
