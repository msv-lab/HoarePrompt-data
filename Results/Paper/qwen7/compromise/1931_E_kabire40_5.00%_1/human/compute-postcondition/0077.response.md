Output State: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` contains `x` if the length of `x` is equal to the length of `x_rev` and is an empty list otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends the reverse of `x` (denoted as `x[::-1]`) to the list `rev_val`. Since `x` was already defined in the initial state, its reverse is added to `rev_val`. The other variables (`x`, `x_rev`, and `rev_res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
