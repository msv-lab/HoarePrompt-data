Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `y` is `k + 1`, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is updated by adding `x` to it. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`. If the length of `x` is equal to the length of `x_rev`, `rev_res` contains `x` and `rev_val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_res` is empty and `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` contains `x` if the length of `x` is equal to the length of `x_rev` and is an empty list otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x` if the lengths of `x` and `x_rev` are not equal, otherwise `rev_val` remains an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
