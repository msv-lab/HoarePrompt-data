Output State: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` contains `x` if the length of `x` is equal to the length of `x_rev` and is an empty list otherwise, `rev_val` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` and converts it to an integer. This operation does not affect the lengths of `x` and `x_rev`, so `rev_res` remains unchanged (it still contains `x` if the lengths are equal and is an empty list otherwise). Since the reversal and conversion to integer did not make `x` itself a reversed list, `rev_val` remains an empty list.
