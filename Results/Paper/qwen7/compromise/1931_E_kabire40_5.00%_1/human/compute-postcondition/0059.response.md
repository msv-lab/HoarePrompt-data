Output State: **`y` is `k + 1`, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter.**

Explanation: The code `operational_list = input().split()` takes an input string and splits it into a list of substrings based on spaces. The original values of `y`, `rev_val`, `rev_res`, `list_len`, and `max_power` remain unchanged. The new variable `operational_list` is created and assigned the list of substrings obtained from the input.
