Output State: **`x` is an integer equal to 0, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `max_power` is less than or equal to 0, `list_len` is the first input value converted to an integer, `max_power` is the second input value converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts using the `split()` function and assigns them to `list_len` and `max_power`. Since the initial state of `x`, `rev_val`, `rev_res`, and `max_power` was known, these values remain unchanged except for `list_len` and `max_power`, which are now assigned the respective input values as integers.
