Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing three tuples `(v1, v2)`, `(v3, 0)`, and `(v1, 0)`, `p1` and `p2` are both empty sets, `v1` is now the fourth last element of `vx`, `v2` is now the third last element of `vx`, `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`, `vx` has removed the third last element (which was `v3`).**

Explanation: The code appends two tuples to the `ops` list: `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`. The values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, with `v1` being the fourth last element of `vx` and `v2` being the third last element of `vx`. The third last element of `vx` (which was `v3`) is removed from `vx`. The states of `p1` and `p2` remain unaffected.
