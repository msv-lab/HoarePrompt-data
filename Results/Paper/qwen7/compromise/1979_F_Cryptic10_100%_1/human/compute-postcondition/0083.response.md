Output State: `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list of tuples, `p1` is a list containing the result of the loop operations, and `p2` is a variable used within the loop but does not persist outside it.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `vx` remains an empty set because no elements are added to it within the loop. The `ops` list remains as it was initialized, but now it is fully processed. The `p1` list will contain the final state of the loop, where each tuple from `ops` is processed according to the condition `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)`. This means that for each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops`, either `p2` (if the last element of `p1` matches `v2`) or `p1` (if they do not match) will append `v1`. Since the loop processes each tuple in `ops` in reverse order, the final state of `p1` will reflect the cumulative effect of these operations based on the given conditions.
