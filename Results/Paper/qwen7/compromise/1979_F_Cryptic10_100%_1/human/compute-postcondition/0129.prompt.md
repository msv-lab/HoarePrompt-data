Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 for each test case, a lambda function `q` is defined which prints '? %d' % d followed by reading a line of input split into integers and returning them as a map object.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    vx, ops = set(i for i in range(1, int(input()) + 1)), []
    while len(vx) > 2:
        v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)
        vx.remove(v1)
        if v2 > 0:
            ops += [(v1, v2)]
        else:
            v3, _ = q(0)
            vx.remove(v3)
            ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]
    p1, p2 = list(vx), []
    for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
        (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)
    print('! %s' % ' '.join(map(str, p1[::-1] + p2)), flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`; `p1` is a list containing the first element of `vx` and an empty list; `p2` is a list containing all the elements from `ops` that were appended based on the condition (`p2` if `p1[-1] == v2 else `p1`).append(`v1`).

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, `vx` remains unchanged as it was initialized and not modified within the loop. The variable `p1` retains its initial structure with the first element of `vx` and an empty list. The variable `p2` collects all the elements that were appended according to the condition specified in the loop body, effectively accumulating all `v1` values that met the condition over all iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is an empty set and an empty list, and `p2` is the last tuple in `ops` if the last element of the last tuple in `ops` equals the second last element of `ops`, otherwise `p1` appends all `v1` values from `ops` to itself.

Explanation: After the loop executes all iterations, `vx` remains an empty set as it was never modified within the loop. The `ops` list becomes empty because we are iterating over `ops[::-1]` and consuming its elements. `p1` starts as an empty set and list, and `p2` starts as an empty set and list. For each iteration, `p2` is updated based on the condition `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)`. If the last element of `p1` equals `v2`, then `p2` is used; otherwise, `p1` appends `v1` to itself. By the end of the loop, `p2` will hold the last tuple from `ops` if the last element of that tuple equals the second last element of `ops`; otherwise, `p1` will contain all `v1` values from `ops`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `vx` will be an empty list, `ops` remains unchanged, `p1` contains the elements of the original `vx`, and `p2` remains an empty list.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the tuples in `ops` in reverse order, appending elements to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition. Since `vx` initially has exactly 2 elements, and the loop processes each tuple in `ops` by removing one element from `vx` per iteration, after processing all tuples in `ops`, `vx` will be completely emptied. The value of `ops` remains unchanged because the loop only modifies `p1` and `p2`. After all iterations, `p1` will contain the elements originally in `vx` (in the order they were removed), and `p2` remains empty as it was initialized.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
