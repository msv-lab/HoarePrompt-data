Postcondition: `vx` has at least 2 elements, `v1` is no longer in `vx`, `v2` is the new second last element of `vx`. If `v2` is greater than 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (`v1`, `v2`) and (`v2`, `v2`). Otherwise, `ops` is a list containing the tuples (0, 0) and (v1, 0). If `v2` is not greater than 0, `vx` does not contain `v3`, and `ops` is a list containing the tuples (v3, 0), (v1, 0), and whatever the original second tuple in `ops` was.
