Postcondition: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to at least 1, `ops` is a list containing either one tuple `(v1, v2)` or two tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` plus an additional tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`, otherwise it contains three tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `p1` is a list containing the first element of the updated `vx` and an empty list, `v1` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 1`, `v2` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 1` and is greater than 0 if the if part is executed, otherwise it is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the result of `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx` if the else part is executed.
