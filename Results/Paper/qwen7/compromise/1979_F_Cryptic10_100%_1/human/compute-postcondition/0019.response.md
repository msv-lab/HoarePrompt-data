Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n-2 excluding `v2`, `v1` is now `v2`, `v2` is the new second last element of `vx`, and `v3` is 0.**

Explanation: The code removes `v3` from the set `vx`. Since `v3` is 0, and `vx` originally contained integers from 1 to n-2 excluding `v1`, after removing `v3`, `vx` will contain integers from 1 to n-2 excluding `v2`. `v1` remains `v2`, and `v2` remains the new second last element of `vx`. `v3` is still 0, and `_` remains undefined.
