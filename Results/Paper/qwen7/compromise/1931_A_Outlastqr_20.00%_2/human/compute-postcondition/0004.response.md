Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an unspecified value for each test case where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and n is an integer between 3 and 78.**

Given the constraints, the function `func` does not accept any parameters directly mentioned in the provided code snippet. The parameters `t` and `n` are described in the problem statement but are not part of the function definition. The function's behavior is not specified beyond the constraints provided, so it simply accepts no parameters and returns an unspecified value for each test case based on the given ranges for `t` and `n`.
