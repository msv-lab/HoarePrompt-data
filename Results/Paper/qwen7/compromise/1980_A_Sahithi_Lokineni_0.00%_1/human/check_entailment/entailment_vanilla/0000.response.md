### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Data Structure Initialization**: The program uses a `defaultdict` initialized with `default_value` which is not defined anywhere in the code. This will cause a NameError when the program runs. It should be initialized with an appropriate default value, such as `0`.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: The program correctly reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.
4. **Counting Problem Difficulties**: The program iterates over the string `s` and counts the occurrences of each difficulty level using a `defaultdict`. This part is correct.
5. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed**: The program calculates the additional problems needed for each difficulty level. However, it only checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`. If a difficulty level's count is greater than `m`, it incorrectly assumes no additional problems are needed for that level.
6. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Issues:
- The `default_value` used in `defaultdict` is undefined, causing a `NameError`.
- The logic for calculating the additional problems needed is flawed. It does not correctly account for the fact that each round requires at least one problem of each difficulty level.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Initialize with 0 instead of default_value
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has issues due to the undefined `default_value` and incorrect logic for calculating the additional problems needed. After correcting these issues, the program should work as expected.

**Correctness: False**
