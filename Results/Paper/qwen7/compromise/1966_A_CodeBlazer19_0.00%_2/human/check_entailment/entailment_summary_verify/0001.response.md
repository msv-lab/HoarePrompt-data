### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards left after performing an operation any number of times. The operation involves choosing `k` cards with the same number and exchanging them for `k-1` new cards.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and a list of card numbers.
   - It then prints `k - 1` without considering the actual distribution of card numbers.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in the code does not account for the actual distribution of card numbers. It simply prints `k - 1` for every test case, regardless of the card numbers.
   - This means the code will always output `k - 1` as the result, which is incorrect because the actual minimum number of cards left depends on the distribution of card numbers.

4. **Examples**:
   - For the first example (`5 3` and `[4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`), the expected output is `2`, but the code outputs `2 - 1 = 1`.
   - For the second example (`1 10` and `[7]`), the expected output is `1`, but the code outputs `10 - 1 = 9`.

5. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary states that the function processes multiple test cases and prints `k - 1` for each test case. However, this summary does not reflect the actual requirements of the problem, which involve considering the distribution of card numbers.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not consider the actual distribution of card numbers. It always outputs `k - 1`, which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided code is incorrect because it does not account for the actual distribution of card numbers and always outputs `k - 1`.
