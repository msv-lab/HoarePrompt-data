Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, and `n` and `k` are the results of `func_4()` call.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_4()` calls the function `func_4()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since the exact implementation of `func_4()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `n` and `k`. However, we know that `n` remains within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^5, and `k` remains within the range of 0 to 10^12. The initial conditions for `n` and `k` are replaced by the values returned from `func_4()`.
