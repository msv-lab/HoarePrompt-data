Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but works with predefined integer variables n, t, u, v, and a list with exactly one element representing the starting node. It returns a value based on the conditions specified for these variables.**

This means the function `func_1` operates with several predefined integer variables: `n` (an integer between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\)), `t` (which is always 1), `u` and `v` (integers between 1 and `n`), and a list containing exactly one starting node. The function's behavior and return value are determined by these predefined variables and their relationships.
