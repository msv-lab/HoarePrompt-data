Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, the goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally against an opponent who also plays optimally. However, the provided program does not simulate the game or account for the strategic decisions made by both players.

The program instead counts the occurrences of each unique element in the input and divides by 3, which is irrelevant to the game described. Specifically, the program does not consider the following aspects:

1. The distribution of cards between you and Nene.
2. The optimal strategy for both players.
3. The fact that Nene always tries to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

Given these requirements, the program fails to address the core logic needed to determine the outcome of the game. Therefore, it is incorrect.
