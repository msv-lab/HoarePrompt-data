Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is not relevant to the problem. It processes an array but doesn't align with the game logic.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to solve the problem using recursion but has several issues:
   - It incorrectly assumes that the game state can be reduced to a simple parity check for two piles.
   - It does not handle the general case where more than two piles are involved.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the number of piles and the values in the piles is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to use the concept of Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes). The key insight is that a position is losing if and only if the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero. Here’s how you can implement it:

```python
def nim_game_winner(n, piles):
    # Calculate the Nim-sum of all pile sizes
    nim_sum = 0
    for pile in piles:
        nim_sum ^= pile
    
    # If the Nim-sum is zero, the current player (Alice) will lose if both play optimally
    if nim_sum == 0:
        return "Bob"
    else:
        return "Alice"

# Reading input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

t = int(data[0])
index = 1

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    piles = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    
    print(nim_game_winner(n, piles))
```

This code correctly determines the winner by calculating the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and checking if it is zero. If the Nim-sum is zero, the current player (Alice) will lose, otherwise, she will win.
