### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided functions do not implement the Nim-sum logic, which is crucial for determining the winner in this game. Let's break down why the original assessment is accurate:

1. **Nim-sum Logic**:
   - In the game described, the key to determining the winner is the Nim-sum (XOR of the sizes of the piles). If the Nim-sum is zero, the current player is in a losing position if the opponent plays optimally.
   - The function `func_2` does not compute the Nim-sum but instead uses a recursive approach to determine the winner based on the number of piles and the sizes of the piles. This approach is not sufficient because it does not account for the specific properties of the Nim-sum.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is not used in the main logic of determining the winner. Its purpose is unclear and does not contribute to the solution of the problem.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The base cases handle simple scenarios correctly.
   - The recursive case attempts to determine the winner by checking if the opponent can force a win or if the current player can force a win. However, this approach is incomplete and does not fully capture the Nim-sum logic.

4. **Recursive Approach vs. Nim-sum**:
   - The recursive approach in `func_2` does not directly use the Nim-sum to determine the winner. Instead, it relies on a series of conditions that may not always be equivalent to the Nim-sum logic.
   - The recursive approach might miss certain edge cases and does not generalize well for larger inputs.

Given these points, the original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the Nim-sum logic, which is essential for solving the problem.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the Nim-sum logic required to determine the winner in the game.
