Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to relate to the game rules at all. The game requires determining the winner based on the XOR of the sizes of the piles, not transforming the piles as `func_1` does or recursively checking moves as `func_2` attempts to do.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to compute the XOR of all pile sizes. If the result is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def game_winner(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        xor_result = 0
        for pile in a:
            xor_result ^= pile
        if xor_result > 0:
            results.append("Alice")
        else:
            results.append("Bob")
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
test_cases = [input().strip() for _ in range(t)]
game_winner(t, test_cases)
```

This program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the XOR of the pile sizes.
