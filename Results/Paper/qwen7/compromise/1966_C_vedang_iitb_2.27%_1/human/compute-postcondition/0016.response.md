Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and an integer `n` indicating the number of piles (with 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). It determines whether the player who starts can guarantee a win based on the current configuration of stone piles. If the starting player can guarantee a win, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns 2.**
