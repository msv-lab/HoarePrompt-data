Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(set_)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` starts from 1 because the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, len(set_))`.
   - `set_` is a list containing sorted unique elements from `arr`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be less than `len(set_)`.
   - Since `i` starts from 1, `len(set_)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` is initially set to 1.
   - `set_` must contain at least two unique elements for the loop to execute.

Given the above points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State:**
- `not_c` is True
- `arr` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, where the length of the list is `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9; `arr[0]` equals 1.
- `set_` is a list containing sorted unique elements from `arr`, and it must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.
- `i` is 1.

So, the final state is:
**State: **`not_c` is True, `arr` is a list of integers where `arr[0]` equals 1, `set_` is a list containing sorted unique elements from `arr` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**.
