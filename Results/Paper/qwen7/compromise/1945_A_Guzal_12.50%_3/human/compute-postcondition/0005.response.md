Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value \(k\) based on specific conditions. If certain constraints are not met, it prints \(-1\) instead. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated \(k\) or \(-1\) for each test case.**
