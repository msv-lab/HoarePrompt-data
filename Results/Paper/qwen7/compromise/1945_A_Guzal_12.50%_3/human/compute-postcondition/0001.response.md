Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute if `n` is at least 1. 

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition, its value does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. The starting value of `i` is 0 because `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (it must be greater than or equal to 1) and `i` (it starts at 0).

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0**
