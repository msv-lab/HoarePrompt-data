Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that each extrovert needs to be paired with two others, and the program does not ensure that this condition is met properly.

For example, consider the test case `1 4 1`:
- There is 1 introvert, 4 extroverts, and 1 universal.
- According to the problem description, the 4 extroverts need to be paired in groups of 3, which means we need at least 2 tents for the extroverts (one tent for 3 extroverts and another for the remaining 1 extrovert).
- The introvert needs a separate tent, and the universal can share a tent with one of the extroverts.
- Therefore, the minimum number of tents required is 3 (1 for the introvert, 1 for 3 extroverts, and 1 for the remaining extrovert and the universal).

However, the program outputs `-1` for this case because it checks if `(b + c) % 3 != 0` and prints `-1` without considering the possibility of using universals to form complete groups of 3 with extroverts.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it can form complete groups of 3 with extroverts and use universals appropriately to fill any remaining spots.
