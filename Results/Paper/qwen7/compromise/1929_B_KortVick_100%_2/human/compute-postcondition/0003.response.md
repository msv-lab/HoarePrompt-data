Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains either `k // 2 + 1` or `ceil(k / 2)`. Specifically, for each iteration of the loop, if `4 * n - 2 == k`, the output will be `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, the output will be `ceil(k / 2)`. The value of `t` is determined by the initial input, and each subsequent input pair `(n, k)` dictates the specific output for that iteration.
