Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either `k // 2 + 1` or `ceil(k / 2)`, depending on whether `4 * n - 2` equals `k` for each iteration. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`, which is provided at the start and represents the number of iterations in the loop. Each line's content depends on the specific values of `n` and `k` entered during each iteration.
