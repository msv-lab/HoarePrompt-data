You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains either `k // 2 + 1` or `ceil(k / 2)`. Specifically, for each iteration of the loop, if `4 * n - 2 == k`, the output will be `k // 2 + 1`; otherwise, the output will be `ceil(k / 2)`. The value of `t` is determined by the initial input, and each subsequent input pair `(n, k)` dictates the specific output for that iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by the number of tests \( t \). For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and outputs either \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) or \( k // 2 + 1 \) based on whether \( 4n - 2 \) equals \( k \). The final state of the program consists of \( t \) lines of output, each corresponding to one test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - A grid of size \( n \times n \) has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution uses the formula `k // 2 + 1` when `4 * n - 2 == k`.
   - For other cases, it uses `ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** When \( 4n - 2 = k \):
     - This means we need exactly \( k \) diagonals to have at least one colored cell.
     - Since each row and column contributes to multiple diagonals, coloring the center cell (if \( n \) is odd) or two cells (if \( n \) is even) can achieve this.
     - The formula `k // 2 + 1` correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed because:
       - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), then \( k // 2 + 1 = (4n - 2) // 2 + 1 = 2n - 1 \).
       - This ensures that all diagonals are covered, as each diagonal will intersect at least one of these cells.
   - **Case 2:** When \( 4n - 2 > k \):
     - Here, we need to cover fewer than all diagonals.
     - The formula `ceil(k / 2)` ensures that we cover at least \( k \) diagonals with the minimum number of cells.
     - This is because each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).

4. **Verification:**
   - The solution handles both edge cases and general cases correctly.
   - The logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.
