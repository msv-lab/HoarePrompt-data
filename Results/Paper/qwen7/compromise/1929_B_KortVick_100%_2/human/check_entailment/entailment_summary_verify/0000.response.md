### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given examples.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Sasha wants to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- The grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.
- The goal is to determine the minimum number of cells to color for each test case.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
- It calculates and prints the minimum number of cells to color using the formula \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) if \( 4n - 2 \neq k \), otherwise it uses \( k // 2 + 1 \).

#### Analysis:
1. **Case when \( 4n - 2 = k \):**
   - The function correctly outputs \( k // 2 + 1 \).
   - This is because when \( k = 4n - 2 \), each diagonal must have at least one colored cell, and the minimum number of cells required is \( (4n - 2) // 2 + 1 \).

2. **Case when \( 4n - 2 > k \):**
   - The function correctly outputs \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
   - This is because we need to color at least \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells to satisfy the requirement of having at least \( k \) diagonals with at least one colored cell.

3. **Case when \( 4n - 2 < k \):**
   - The function should not occur because \( k \) cannot be greater than \( 4n - 2 \) according to the problem constraints. However, the function summary does not explicitly mention handling this case, but it doesn't lead to incorrect results since the maximum value of \( k \) is \( 4n - 2 \).

Given the examples provided:
- For \( (3, 4) \): The output is \( 2 \), which is correct.
- For \( (3, 3) \): The output is \( 2 \), which is correct.
- For \( (3, 10) \): The output is \( 6 \), which is correct.
- For \( (3, 9) \): The output is \( 5 \), which is correct.
- For \( (4, 7) \): The output is \( 4 \), which is correct.
- For \( (7, 11) \): The output is \( 6 \), which is correct.
- For \( (2, 3) \): The output is \( 2 \), which is correct.

The program handles all the given test cases correctly. The original assessment incorrectly identified a potential issue with boundary conditions, but upon closer inspection, the program actually handles these cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.
