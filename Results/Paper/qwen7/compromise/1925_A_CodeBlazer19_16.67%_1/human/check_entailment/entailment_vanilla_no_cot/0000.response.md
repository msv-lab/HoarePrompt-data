Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly generate the required string `s` for all cases. Let's analyze why:

1. **Single Character Case (`k == 1`):**
   - The code prints `n * s`, where `s` is a string of length `k-97+1` (i.e., a single character). This works correctly for the case when `k == 1`, but it doesn't handle the scenario where `k > 1`.

2. **Multiple Characters Case (`k > 1`):**
   - For `k > 1`, the code generates a string `s` containing the first `k` lowercase letters. However, this approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase letters appear as subsequences.
   - For example, for `n=2` and `k=2`, the output should be `baab` to include both "aa" and "ab" as subsequences, but the code outputs `baba` instead.

To fix this, we need to construct the string `s` in a way that guarantees all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters appear in `s`. One effective method is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of a given length appears exactly once.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def de_bruijn(k, n):
    """Generates a de Bruijn sequence for alphabet size k and subsequences of length n."""
    a = [0] * k * n
    sequence = []

    def db(t, p):
        if t > n:
            if n % p == 0:
                for j in range(1, p + 1):
                    sequence.append(a[j])
        else:
            a[t] = a[t - p]
            db(t + 1, p)
            for j in range(a[t - p], k - 1):
                a[t] = j
                db(t + 1, t)

    db(1, 1)
    return ''.join(chr(i + 97) for i in sequence)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        print(de_bruijn(k, n))

func()
```

This function uses a recursive algorithm to generate a de Bruijn sequence, ensuring that all subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters appear in the generated string.
