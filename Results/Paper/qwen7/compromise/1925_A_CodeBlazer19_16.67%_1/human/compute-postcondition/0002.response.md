Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 676, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 676, and `i` remains 0. The values of `n` and `k` are the integers entered by the user.
