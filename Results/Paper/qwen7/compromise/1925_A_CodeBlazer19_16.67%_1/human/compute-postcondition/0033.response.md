Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 105, `s` is the string 'z' repeated 105 times, and `j` is 202.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If `k` is 1, then `s` remains 'z'. Otherwise, if `k` is not 1, `s` becomes 'z' repeated 105 times. In both cases, the other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
