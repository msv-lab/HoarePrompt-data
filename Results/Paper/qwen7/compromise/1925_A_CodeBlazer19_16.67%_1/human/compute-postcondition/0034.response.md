Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the first integer input (this variable is not directly involved in the loop condition).
   - `k` is 105.
   - `s` is the string 'z' repeated 105 times.
   - `j` is 202.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 105, `s` is the string 'z' repeated 105 times, and `j` is 202**.
