Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(97, k + 97)`. The variable `j` is the iterator in the loop.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\)
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is the first integer input
   - `k` is 105
   - `s` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 106 (which is 'j')
   - `j` is 106

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `97` to `k + 97 - 1`. Since `k` is 105, the loop runs from `97` to `201`.

4. **Determine the new state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 106.
   - For the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 107.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is 105, `s` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of 106, `j` is 107**
