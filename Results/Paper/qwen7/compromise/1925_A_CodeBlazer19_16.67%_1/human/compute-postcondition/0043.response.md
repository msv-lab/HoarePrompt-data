Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is 105, `s` is the string "bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", `j` is 122.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 97` to `j = 202 + 97 - 1 = 202`. Since the loop increments `j` by the default step of 1, it will run exactly 106 times (from 97 to 202 inclusive). Each iteration appends the character corresponding to the current value of `j` to the string `s`. Therefore, after 106 iterations, `s` will contain all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. The final value of `j` will be 122, which is the ASCII value for 'z'.
