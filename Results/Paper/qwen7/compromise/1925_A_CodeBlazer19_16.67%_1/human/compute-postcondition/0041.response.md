Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for j in range(97, k + 97)`. The only variable involved in the loop head is `j`.

2. **Determine the current value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 98.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `97` to `k + 97`. Given that `k` is 105, the range is `97` to `202`.

4. **Calculate the next value of `j`**: Since `j` starts at 98 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 99.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `202`. Since `j` is now 99, it is still within the range.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which will be incremented to 99.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is 105, `s` is the string "b", `j` is 99**
