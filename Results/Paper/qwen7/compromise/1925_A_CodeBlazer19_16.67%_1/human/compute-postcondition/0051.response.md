Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 676, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer, `s` is the string containing all lowercase letters from the 97th to the \(k+96\)th ASCII character, and `j` is the next ASCII character after `k` + 96.**

In this final state, the loop has executed 676 times. The variable `i` will be 676 because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. The variables `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last input provided during the loop's execution. The string `s` will contain all lowercase letters starting from the 97th ASCII character ('a') up to the `k+96`th ASCII character. The variable `j` will be set to the ASCII character following the last character added to `s`, which is `k + 96`.
