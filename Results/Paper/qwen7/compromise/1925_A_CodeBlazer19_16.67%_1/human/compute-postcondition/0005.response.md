Output State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a string containing 'a', `j` is 97**.

The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` (which is 97) to the string `s`. Since `j` is 97, it appends the character 'a' to `s`, making `s` equal to 'a'. All other variables remain unchanged.
