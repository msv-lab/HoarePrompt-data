Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 2, `z_l` is either increased by 1 or unchanged, `o_l` is unchanged, `o_r` is unchanged, `ans` is equal to `pos`, the condition `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)` is still true, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_l + o_l)` is still true, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true or false, the following conditions hold: `i` remains as the next element in `arr`, `pos` is incremented by 2, `z_l` either increases by 1 or stays the same, while `o_l`, `o_r`, and `z_r` remain unchanged. Additionally, `ans` is set to `pos`, and the conditions involving `o_r`, `z_l`, and `b_d` are preserved.
