Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop continues as long as `t` is non-zero.

2. **Current state**: 
   - `t` is `t - 1` (implying `t` was decremented in the previous iteration).
   - `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`.
   - `z_l` is equal to the count of zeros in `arr`.
   - `o_l` is equal to the count of ones in `arr`.
   - `z_r` is 0.
   - `o_r` is 0.
   - `ans` is equal to the last position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` were satisfied.
   - `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` found during the loop's execution.

3. **Determine what needs to change**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be non-zero. Since `t` is `t - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be set back to a positive value.

Given the current state, `t` is already `t - 1`, and there are no other variables in the loop head that can be adjusted directly to control the loop continuation.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive value**
