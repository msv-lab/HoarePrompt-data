Output State: **`t` must be a positive value, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers converted from each character in `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`.**

The code counts the number of zeros in the list `arr` and assigns this count to the variable `z`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
