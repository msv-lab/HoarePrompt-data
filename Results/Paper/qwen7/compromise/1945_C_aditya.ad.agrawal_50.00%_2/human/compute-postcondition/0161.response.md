Output State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is 0, `o_l` is increased by 1 if the second element of `arr` is not 0, `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`, `ans` is 3**.

Explanation: The line `ans = pos` assigns the value of `pos` (which is 3) to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
