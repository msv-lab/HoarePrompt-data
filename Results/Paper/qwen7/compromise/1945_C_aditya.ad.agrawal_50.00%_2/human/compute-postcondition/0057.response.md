Output State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 3, `z_l` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `o_l` and `o_r` may change by Â±1, `z_r` may decrease by 1, `ans` is equal to `pos`, and the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` are still true.**

Explanation: The line `ans = pos` assigns the current value of `pos` to `ans`. Since `pos` was already increased by 3, `ans` now holds the new value of `pos`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged as no other operations were performed on them.
