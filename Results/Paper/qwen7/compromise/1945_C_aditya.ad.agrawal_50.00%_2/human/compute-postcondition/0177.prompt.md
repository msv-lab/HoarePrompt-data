Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive value, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers converted from each character in `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)`, then `b_d` remains unchanged as `abs(n / 2)`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the first element of `arr`; `pos` is 1; `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is 0; `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2` and `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`; `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if the second element of `arr` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is 0, `o_l` is increased by 1 if the second element of `arr` is not 0, `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to `(z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - 3`, `ans` is 3 if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - 3))` is true, otherwise `ans` remains as previously defined based on the second element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 2 and `o_r` is decreased by 1, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
