Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    input_string = input()
    arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
    z = arr.count(0)
    o = arr.count(1)
    z_r = z
    o_r = o
    z_l = 0
    o_l = 0
    dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
        b_d = dist
    else:
        b_d = 30001
    for i in arr:
        pos += 1
        if i == 0:
            z_l += 1
            z_r -= 1
        else:
            o_l += 1
            o_r -= 1
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(
            n / 2 - pos):
            ans = pos
            b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is decreased by 1; `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`; `z_l` is the total number of 0s in `arr`; `o_l` is the total number of 1s initially minus the total number of 1s encountered; `o_r` is the total number of 1s initially minus the total number of 1s encountered; `z_r` is the total number of 0s initially minus the total number of 0s encountered; `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` was last satisfied; `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos` at the last iteration.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is `t - 1`, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_l` is equal to the count of zeros in `arr`, `o_l` is equal to the count of ones in `arr`, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 0, `ans` is equal to the last position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` were satisfied and `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` holds true, `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` found during the loop's execution.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: All elements in `arr` have been processed; `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`; `z_r` is equal to the initial value of `z` minus the count of 0s in `arr`; `o_r` is equal to the initial value of `o` minus the count of 1s in `arr`; `o_l` is equal to the count of 1s in `arr`; `z_l` is equal to the count of 0s in `arr`; `b_d` is the minimum value of `abs(n / 2 - pos)` where `pos` is updated in each iteration; `ans` is the position where the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` are satisfied and `b_d` is minimized, or it remains unchanged if no such position is found; `t` is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
