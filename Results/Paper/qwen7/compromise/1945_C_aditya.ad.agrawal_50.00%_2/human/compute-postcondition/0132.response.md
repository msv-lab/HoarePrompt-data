Output State: **`t` is a positive value, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers converted from each character in `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0**.

This output state reflects that the variables `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `ans`, and `pos` retain their initial conditions except for `dist`, `ans`, and `pos`, which are now set to `abs(n / 2)`, 0, and 0 respectively.
