Output State: **`o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2) - b_d`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, and `b_d` is `dist`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `dist` to `b_d`. Since `dist` is initially `abs(n / 2)`, `b_d` now holds this value. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `o_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `ans`, and `pos` retain their initial values, and `dist` is updated to `abs(n / 2) - b_d` because `b_d` was previously set to `dist`.
