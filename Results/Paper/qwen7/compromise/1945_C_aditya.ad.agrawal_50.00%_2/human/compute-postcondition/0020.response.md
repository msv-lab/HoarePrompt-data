Output State: **`i` is an element of `arr`, and `pos` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. Since `i` is an element of `arr` and the condition that `arr` must contain at least one element remains unchanged, the updated state includes that `pos` has been incremented by 1.
