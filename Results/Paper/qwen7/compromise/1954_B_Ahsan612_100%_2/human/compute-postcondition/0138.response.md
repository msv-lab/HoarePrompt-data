Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and 1, `same` is equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num` is not specified. If `minn` is infinity or `minn` is equal to the length of `ar`, no changes are made. Otherwise, the condition `minn` is neither infinity nor equal to the length of `ar` holds true.
