Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is equal to `ar[6]`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is 6.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[6]` to `num`. Since `i` is 6 and `same` is 2, the condition for `ar[i]` being equal to `num` is met. The other variables remain unchanged.
