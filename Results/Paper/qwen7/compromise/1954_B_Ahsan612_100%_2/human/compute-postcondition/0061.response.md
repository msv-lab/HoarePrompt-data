Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` must have more than one element, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[2]` to `num`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
