Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` must have more than 3 elements, `num` is now `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 1, `i` is 4 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to be the element at index `i` in the list `ar`. The value of `i` is determined based on whether `ar[2]` is equal to the original `num` or not. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
