Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `ar` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1, `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same` after all iterations, `n` is an input integer, `same` is equal to 1, `num` is not specified.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of `ar`. The variable `minn` will be updated with the minimum value between its current value and `same` after each iteration where `same` is reset to 1. The variable `same` will be set to 1 at the end of the loop, and `num` will not be specified as it is not used outside the loop body once the loop ends.
