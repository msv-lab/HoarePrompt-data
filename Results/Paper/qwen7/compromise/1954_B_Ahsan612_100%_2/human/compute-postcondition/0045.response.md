Based on the initial state provided:

- `same` is between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1.
- `num` is the first element of the list `ar` or any subsequent element that matches `same`.
- `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same` encountered during the loop.
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
- `minn` is not equal to infinity and is less than the length of `ar`.

The key point here is that `minn` is described as being less than the length of `ar` and not equal to infinity. This means that `minn` must have been updated during the loop to a value that is a valid index in the list `ar`.

Given this, the value of `minn` will be printed. Since the exact value of `minn` is not specified, we can only say that it is a valid index in the list `ar` and is less than the length of `ar`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value between minn and same encountered during the loop and is less than the length of ar)**
