Output State: **`minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `same`; `i` is increased by 1; `num` is equal to `ar[i]`; `same` is 1; `t`, `n`, and `ar` retain their initial values.**

Explanation: The variable `same` is explicitly set to 1. The values of `minn`, `i`, `num`, and the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `ar`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `same`, which is now 1. The variable `i` is increased by 1, and `num` is set to the value of `ar[i]`.
