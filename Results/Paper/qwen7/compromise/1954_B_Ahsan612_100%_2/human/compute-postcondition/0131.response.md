Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `ar` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1, `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same` for every iteration, `n` is an input integer, `same` is equal to 1, `num` is not specified.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `i` is now equal to the length of the list `ar`. The variable `minn` holds the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop's execution. The variable `same` is reset to 1 at the end of the loop, and `num` is no longer specified as it was not reassigned in the loop body.
