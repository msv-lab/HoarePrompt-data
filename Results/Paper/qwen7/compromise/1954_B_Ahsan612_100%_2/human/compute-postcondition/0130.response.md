Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `same` is equal to 1, `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and 1, `ar` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1, and `num` is not specified.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables (`same`, `minn`, `ar`, and `num`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The condition checking if `ar[i]` equals `num` and updating `same` accordingly does not occur because the increment operation is performed regardless of the condition.
