Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `ar` is a list of integers created from the input
   - `minn` is infinity
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `same` is 1
   - `num` is equal to the first element of the list `ar`

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `ar`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `i` is currently 1
   - We need to check the length of `ar` to see if `i < len(ar)` holds true.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` should be less than `len(ar)`.
   - Given `i` is 1, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the length of the list `ar`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `ar` is a list of integers created from the input and its length must be greater than 1, `minn` is infinity, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to the first element of the list `ar`**
