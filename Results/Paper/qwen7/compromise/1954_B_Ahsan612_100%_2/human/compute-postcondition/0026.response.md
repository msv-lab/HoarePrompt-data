Postcondition: `same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` retain their original properties as described in the precondition. If `ar[i] == num` (where `i` is 5), then `same` is 3, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`. Otherwise, if `ar[i] != num` (where `i` is 4 when `same` is 1), then `same` is 1, `num` is equal to `ar[6]`, `minn` is 2, and `i` is 6.
