Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers. It then finds and prints the smallest number of consecutive identical elements in the list `ar`. If no such sequence exists, it prints `-1`. The function implicitly accepts input through standard input and outputs results through standard output.**
