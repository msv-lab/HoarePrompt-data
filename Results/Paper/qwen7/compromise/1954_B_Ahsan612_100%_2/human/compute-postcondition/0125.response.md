Output State: **`i` is equal to its original value plus 1; `ar` is a list of integers with a length greater than 1; `num` is the integer at index `i` in the list `ar`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `i` in the list `ar` to the variable `num`. The value of `i` is updated to its original value plus 1, and the list `ar` remains unchanged.
