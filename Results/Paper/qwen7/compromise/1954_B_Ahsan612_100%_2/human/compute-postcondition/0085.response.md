Output State: `same` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer inputted by the user, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value encountered during the loop (initially the minimum of its original value and 1), `i` is the index of the last element checked in the list `ar`.

In this final state, the loop has iterated through all elements of the list `ar`. The variable `same` keeps track of consecutive occurrences of the current number (`num`) until it changes or reaches the end of the list. The variable `minn` stores the smallest value of `same` encountered during the loop's execution. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `ar` if the loop completes without prematurely breaking out due to a change in `num`. If `num` changes before the end of the list, `i` will be the index right after the last occurrence of `num`.
