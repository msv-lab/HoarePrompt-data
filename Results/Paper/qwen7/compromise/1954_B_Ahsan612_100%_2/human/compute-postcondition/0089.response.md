Based on the initial state provided:

- `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
- `same` is the total number of occurrences of the most frequent element in the list `ar`.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the integer inputted by the user.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1.
- `num` is the first element of the list `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`.
- `i` is the index of the next element in the list `ar` to be processed.
- Either `minn` is infinity or `minn` equals the length of the list `ar`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This print statement directly outputs the integer `-1` without any dependency on the values of other variables or objects.

Output: **-1**
