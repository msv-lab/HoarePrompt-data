Output State: **`i` is 2, `ar` is a list of integers created from the input with its length greater than 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`minn`) and the value of `same` (which is 1). The other variables remain unchanged.
