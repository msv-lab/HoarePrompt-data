Output State: **`same` is between 1 and 5 (inclusive), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar` or any subsequent element that matches `same`, `minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and `same` encountered during the loop, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and the current value of `same`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `minn` to be the minimum value between its original value and the current value of `same`. Since `same` is between 1 and 5 (inclusive), and `minn` was initially set to infinity, `minn` will now be the minimum value between infinity and the current value of `same`, which means `minn` will be the current value of `same` if it is less than infinity. The other variables remain unchanged.
