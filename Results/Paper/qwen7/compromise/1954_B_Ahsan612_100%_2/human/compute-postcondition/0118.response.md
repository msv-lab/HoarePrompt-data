Output State: **`i` is 4, `ar` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 1, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to `ar[3]`, and `ar[3]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The line `same = 1` updates the value of `same` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` remains 4, `ar` remains a list of integers with a length greater than 1, `minn` is now the minimum of its original value and 1, `n` remains an input integer, `same` is now 1, `num` is still equal to `ar[3]`, and `ar[3]` is still equal to `num`.
