Output State: **`same` is 2, `minn` is the minimum of its original value and 2, `i` is 4 if `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`, otherwise `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and `same`, which is 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged except for `minn`, which is now the minimum of its original value and 2.
