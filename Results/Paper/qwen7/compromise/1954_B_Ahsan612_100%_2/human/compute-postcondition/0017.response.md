Postcondition: `same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with a length greater than 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `i` is 3, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, then `same` becomes 2. Otherwise, `same` remains 1.
