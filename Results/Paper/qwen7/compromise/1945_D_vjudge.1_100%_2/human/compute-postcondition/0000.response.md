Output State: **`c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])` for `i` in the range `n`, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that `1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000`, `k` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`, and `b` is a list of `n` positive integers where `1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9`.**

This means that the list `c` has been created such that each element `c[i]` is the minimum of the corresponding elements `a[i]` and `b[i]` from the lists `a` and `b`, respectively. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
