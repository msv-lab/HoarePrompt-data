Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `n-1` down to `0`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts at `n-1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`, the initial value of `i` should be `n-1`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `n-1`.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`c`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `suff`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. They remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-1`**
