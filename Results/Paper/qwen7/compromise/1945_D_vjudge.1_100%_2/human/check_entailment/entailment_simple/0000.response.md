Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` from the standard input.
2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the parsed values, which is appropriate.
3. **Function Implementation**:
   - **Step 1**: It creates a list `c` where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. This step ensures that Kirill pays the minimum cost to swap positions.
   - **Step 2**: It calculates the suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`. This is done to efficiently calculate the total cost of moving Kirill to any position `i` using the previously computed sums.
   - **Step 3**: It initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates through the first `k` positions to find the minimum cost of moving Kirill to any of these positions. For each position `i`, it calculates the cost as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` and updates `ans` if this cost is lower than the current `ans`.
   - **Step 4**: Finally, it prints the minimum cost `ans`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. There are no logical errors or missing steps that would cause the program to produce incorrect results based on the provided problem description and example.
