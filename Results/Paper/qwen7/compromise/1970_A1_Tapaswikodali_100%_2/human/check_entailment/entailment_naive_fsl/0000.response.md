Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not handle the sorting of the balance information correctly. The sorting key should prioritize non-negative balances first and then sort by position in descending order within the same balance level. However, the current implementation sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order, which does not guarantee that prefixes will have non-negative balances.

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The expected balanced shuffle is `()(()())`, but the current implementation might produce an incorrect sequence due to the sorting logic. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:

1. **Compute Balance Information:**
   ```
   Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3
   Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
   Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )
   ```

2. **Sort by Balance and Position:**
   The current implementation sorts by `(balance, -position)`, which means it prioritizes negative balances over positive ones and sorts positions in descending order within the same balance level. This can lead to incorrect sequences.

3. **Expected Sorted Table:**
   ```
   Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3
   Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
   Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )
   ```

4. **Resulting Sequence:**
   The resulting sequence from the current implementation might not maintain the required non-negative balance property for prefixes.

To fix this, the sorting key should be adjusted to prioritize non-negative balances and then sort by position in descending order within the same balance level. Here’s a corrected version of the `func_2` function:

```python
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (max(x.balance, 0), -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)

class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
```

This corrected version ensures that the balance property is always non-negative and maintains the required order for correct balanced shuffles.
