Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires implementing a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle involves calculating the balance of each prefix, sorting based on this balance and position, and then reconstructing the sequence.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function compares two `BalanceInfo` objects. It returns the difference in balance if they differ, otherwise, it returns the difference in position. This function correctly handles the comparison logic required for sorting.
   - **func_2**: This function processes the input string `s` to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects. It then sorts this list based on the balance and position using the custom comparator from `func_1`. Finally, it constructs and prints the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.
3. **Verification**:
   - The input string `s` is processed to create `BalanceInfo` objects, which correctly capture the balance and position of each character.
   - These objects are sorted according to the specified criteria, ensuring that the sequence is reconstructed in the correct order.
   - The final output matches the expected behavior of the balanced shuffle operation.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
