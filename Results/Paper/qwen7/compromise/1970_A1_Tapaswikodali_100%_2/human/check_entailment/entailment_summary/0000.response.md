Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to implement the balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence.
2. We need to verify if the provided code correctly implements this operation.
3. The provided code consists of two functions:
   - `func_1`: A helper function used for sorting. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
   - `func_2`: The main function that performs the balanced shuffle operation.

Let's analyze `func_2`:
- It iterates through the input string `s` and calculates the balance at each position, storing the balance, position, and character in a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
- It then sorts this list using the custom comparator provided by `func_1`.
- Finally, it constructs a new string from the characters in the sorted list and prints it.

Now, let's check if this implementation meets the requirements:
- The balance calculation is correct and stored in the `BalanceInfo` objects.
- The sorting logic respects the problem statement: first by balance (non-negative balance), and then by position in descending order for ties.
- The construction of the result string from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects is done correctly.

Given the provided information and the analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
