Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object involved here is the result of `int(input())`, which we will denote as `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Ensure the loop condition is met**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, the initial value of `t` must satisfy \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, the initial state of `t` must be within the given range.

Based on the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
