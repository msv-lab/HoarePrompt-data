Postcondition: `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 8, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `n`, and if `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` remains unchanged; otherwise, the number of `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.
