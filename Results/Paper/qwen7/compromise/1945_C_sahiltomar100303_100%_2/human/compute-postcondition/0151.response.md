Postcondition: `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 8, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `n`, and `left` is 0, regardless of the value of `left` before the if statement as long as it is not 0 in the if part. If `left` is 0 in the else part, the value of `right` remains `n`.
