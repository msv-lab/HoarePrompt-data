Output State: **`right` is `right + 1`, `tleftZero` and `trightOne` satisfy their original conditions, and either `tleftZero` is increased by 1 while `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right - 1] == '0'`, or `tleftOne` is increased by 1 while `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `right` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain unchanged unless the character at the new position `s[right - 1]` (which was previously `s[right]`) is '0', in which case `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1, or if it is '1', in which case `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.
