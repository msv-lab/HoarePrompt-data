Output State: **`rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'**

Explanation: The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Since `tleftZero` was initially 0, after executing this line, `tleftZero` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
