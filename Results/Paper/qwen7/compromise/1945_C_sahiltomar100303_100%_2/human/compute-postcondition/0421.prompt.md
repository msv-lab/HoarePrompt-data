Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `leftMove` is 0, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` will be equal to the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` will be equal to the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`; `left` is set to `mid`.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `leftZero` is reduced by 1 if the character at `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1` plus 1, `left` is now `mid - 1`, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `leftZero` is reduced by 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `left` is now `mid - 1 - 1`, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must hold true for the next iteration. Additionally, if `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1; otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `leftZero` is reduced by 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `left` is now `mid - 2`, `mid` must be greater than 2, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must hold true for the next iteration. If `s[left - 1] == '0'`, then `rightZero` is 1 more than its previous value; otherwise, `leftOne` is reduced by 1 and `rightOne` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
