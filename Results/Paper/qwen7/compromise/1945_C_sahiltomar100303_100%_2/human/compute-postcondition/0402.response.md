Output State: **`leftMove` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `leftOne` is decreased by 1 is not directly mentioned in the output state but is implied by the code execution. The other conditions and values of the variables are kept as they were in the initial state.
