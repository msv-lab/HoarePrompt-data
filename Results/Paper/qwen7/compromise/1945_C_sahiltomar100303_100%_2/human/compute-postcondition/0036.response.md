Output State: **rightZero is 0, trightZero is 0, tleftOne is 3, trightOne is 0.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = mid - 1`. After each iteration, the value of `i` increases by 1. The loop increments `leftZero` by 1 if `s[i]` is '0' and `tleftZero` by 1 if `s[i]` is '0'. If `s[i]` is not '0', it increments `leftOne` and `tleftOne` by 1. Since the loop runs for `mid` iterations, `i` will eventually equal `mid`. Given the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer that `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are being incremented correctly based on the characters in the string `s`. By the end of all iterations, `tleftZero` will be equal to the number of '0's in the string `s` up to index `mid-1`, and `tleftOne` will be equal to the number of '1's in the string `s` up to index `mid-1`. Therefore, `tleftZero` is 3 and `tleftOne` is 0, while `rightZero`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain 0 as they are not affected by the loop.
