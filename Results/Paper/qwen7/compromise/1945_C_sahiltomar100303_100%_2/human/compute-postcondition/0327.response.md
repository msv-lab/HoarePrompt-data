Postcondition: **`right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`. Regardless of whether `left` is 0 or not, the values of `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain unchanged. If `left` is 0, `right` remains unchanged. If `left` is not 0, `right` becomes `n` if the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is greater than the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2`.**
