Output State: **`rightZero` is 3, `leftZero` is either `left - 3` or `left - 2`, `left` must be greater than 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` is either 3 or `trightOne - 13`, `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`, `rightOne` is 4.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` was initially either 3 or `trightOne - 13`, after the increment, `rightOne` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
