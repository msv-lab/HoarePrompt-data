Output State: **`rightZero` retains its initial value, `trightZero` retains its initial value, `tleftOne` retains its initial value, `trightOne` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `mid`, `leftZero` is `leftZero + 1`.**

In this scenario, the code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. All other variables (`rightZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `mid`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `i` must be less than `mid` is also preserved.
