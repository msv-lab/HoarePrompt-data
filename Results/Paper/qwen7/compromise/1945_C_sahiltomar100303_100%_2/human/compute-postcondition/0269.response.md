Output State: **`right` is less than `n`; `tleftZero` is increased by 1; `trightZero` is decreased by 1; either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remains valid as per the initial state.
