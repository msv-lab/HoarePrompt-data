Output State: **`left` is less than or equal to -1, `leftZero` is adjusted based on the characters encountered during the loop execution, `rightZero` is increased by the count of '0's encountered from the left side, and `rightOne` is increased by the count of '1's encountered from the left side, with `leftOne` being decreased by the count of '1's encountered from the left side; `right` is set to `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `right = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. This does not affect the values of `left`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, or `rightZero`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state, except for `right`, which is now set to `mid`.
