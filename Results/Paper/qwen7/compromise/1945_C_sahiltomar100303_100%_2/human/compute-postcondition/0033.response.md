Output State: **`rightZero` retains its initial value, `trightZero` retains its initial value, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, `trightOne` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. All other variables (`rightZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `mid`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
