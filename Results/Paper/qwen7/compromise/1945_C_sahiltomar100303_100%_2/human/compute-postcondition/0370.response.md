Output State: **`i` is `mid`, `n` must be greater than `mid`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is increased by 1 (so `rightZero` is now `rightZero + 1`).**

This means that the variable `rightZero` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
