Postcondition: `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `i`, and `mid` retain their initial values. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is incremented by 1 and `tleftZero` is also incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `i` is set to 0.
