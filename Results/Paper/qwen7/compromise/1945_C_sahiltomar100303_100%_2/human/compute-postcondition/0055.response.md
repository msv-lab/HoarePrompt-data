Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` such that `i < n`, `rightZero` is increased by 1, `rightOne` remains unchanged.**

The code `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `rightZero` being increased by 1, while `s`, `i`, and `rightOne` retain their original values.
