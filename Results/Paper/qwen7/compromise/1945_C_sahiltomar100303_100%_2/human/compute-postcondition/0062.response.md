Output State: **`rightZero` is 3, `trightZero` is 3, `tleftOne` is 6, `trightOne` is 2, `left` is equal to `mid`, `leftMove` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `leftMove = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `leftMove`. Since `left` was previously set to `mid`, this assignment does not affect `left`. All other variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
