Output State: **`rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0**

Explanation: The code sets `trightOne` to 0. This directly updates the value of `trightOne`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
