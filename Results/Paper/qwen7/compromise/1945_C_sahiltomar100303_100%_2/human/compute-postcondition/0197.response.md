Postcondition: **`rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is either 0, 1, or 2, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `i` is 4 or 2, `mid` must be greater than 0.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that all possible outcomes are covered. Specifically, if `s[i] == '0'`, `leftZero` can be 1, 2, or 3. If `s[i] != '0'`, `leftZero` can be 0, 1, or 2 and `leftOne` can be 1 or 3, while `tleftOne` is constrained to be 1.
