Output State: **`rightZero` is either 4 or 3; `leftZero` is either `left - 5`, `left - 4`, or `left - 3`; `left` is `left - 1`; `leftMove` remains 0; `trightZero` remains 3; `tleftOne` remains 6; `trightOne` is either 3 or `trightOne - 13`; `leftOne` is either `leftOne - 13` or `leftOne - 14`; both `leftZero` is at least `(left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne` is at least `(n - left + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `left` is decremented by 1, so `left` becomes `left - 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state conditions.
