Output State: **`rightZero` is 4, `leftZero` is 2, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` is 3, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `mid`, and `n` must be greater than 9, and the current value of `s[right]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `tleftZero` was 1, so after executing `tleftZero += 1`, its value becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
