Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(mid)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mid` is greater than 0.
   - If `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 3, `tleftZero` is 4.
   - Otherwise, `leftOne` is 4, `leftZero` is 2, and `tleftZero` is 3.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and the loop is iterating over `range(mid)`, the loop will continue as long as `i < mid`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.
   - The condition `mid > 0` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `mid` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - The values of `leftZero`, `leftOne`, and `tleftZero` do not change based on the loop head alone and are not part of the loop head conditions.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The new state should reflect the updated value of `i` and the unchanged condition on `mid`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 0**.
