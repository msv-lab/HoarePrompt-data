Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \) and a binary string \( a \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the number of zeros and ones in the first half and the second half of the string. It then determines and prints the index of the character in the string that minimizes the absolute difference between the count of zeros and ones in the two halves when that character is moved to the boundary. If there are multiple such indices, it prints the smallest one.**
