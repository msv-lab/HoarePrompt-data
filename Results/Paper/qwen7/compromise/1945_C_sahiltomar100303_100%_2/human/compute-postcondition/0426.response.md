Output State: **`leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `left + 1` + 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is now `0`, `mid` is 0, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and `right` is set to `mid`, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightOne` must be less than `(n + 1) // 2`, the current value of `s[right]` is '0'**

Explanation: The line `tleftZero += 1` increments `tleftZero` by 1. Since `tleftZero` was previously 0, it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
