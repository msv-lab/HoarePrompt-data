Postcondition: **`rightZero` is 3 or 4, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 1 or 2, `tleftOne` is 6 or 7, `trightOne` is 1 or 2, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `mid`, `n` must be less than or equal to 9, and `s[right]` is either '0' or not '0'.**

This postcondition summarizes both possible outcomes of the if-else block. If `s[right] == '0'`, then `rightZero` becomes 3 and `trightZero` becomes 1. Otherwise, `rightZero` remains 4 and `trightZero` remains 2, while other variables remain unchanged as specified in the else part.
