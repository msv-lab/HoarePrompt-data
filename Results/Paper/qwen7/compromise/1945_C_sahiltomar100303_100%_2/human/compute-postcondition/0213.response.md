Output State: **`rightOne` is 1 or 3, `rightZero` is either 0 or 1, `leftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is either 0 or 1, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `trightOne` is 1, `leftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `i` is `n // 2 + 1**.

Explanation: The line `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `trightOne` by 1. Since `trightOne` could initially be either 0 or 1, after executing this line, `trightOne` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
