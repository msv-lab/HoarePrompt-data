Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0**.

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is assigned the value 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `tleftOne` and retains the initial values of all other variables.
