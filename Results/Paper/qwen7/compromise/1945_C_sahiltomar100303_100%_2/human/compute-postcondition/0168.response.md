Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 8, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`**

Explanation: The line `rightZero = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `rightZero`. Since `rightZero` was already 0 before this assignment, its value remains unchanged. All other variables (`leftZero`, `left`, `leftMove`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `leftOne`, `right`, `mid`) are not affected by this line of code, so their values remain the same as they were in the initial state.
