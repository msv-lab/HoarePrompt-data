Output State: **`right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` must be such that `tleftZero < (right + 2) // 2`, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, and `trightOne` must be such that `trightOne < (n - (right + 1) + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. The conditions involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain unchanged, meaning `tleftZero` still needs to be less than `(right + 2) // 2` and `trightOne` still needs to be less than `(n - (right + 1) + 1) // 2`. The value of `right` and `n` remain as they were in the initial state.
