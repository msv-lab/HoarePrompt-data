Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0**

Explanation: The line `trightOne = 0` sets the value of `trightOne` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
