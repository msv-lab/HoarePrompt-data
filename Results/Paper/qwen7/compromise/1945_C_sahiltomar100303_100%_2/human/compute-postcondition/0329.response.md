Output State: **`right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `right`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
