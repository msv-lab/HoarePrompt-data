Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` is equal to `n`.
- `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`.
- The current value of `left` is 0.
- `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

The `print(left)` statement will print the value of the variable `left`.

Since the precondition explicitly states that the current value of `left` is 0, we can directly use this value.

Output: **0**
