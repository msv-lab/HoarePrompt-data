Output State: **`rightZero` is 4, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` is 3, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `mid`, `n` is greater than 9, `s[right]` is not '0', `tleftOne` is 7**.

The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Given that `tleftOne` was initially 6, after executing this line, `tleftOne` becomes 7. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
