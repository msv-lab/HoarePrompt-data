Output State: **`rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is either 1 or 2, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is either 0 or 2, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 3, `mid` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The line `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Since `tleftZero` was either 0 or 1 initially, it now becomes either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is also incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3.
