Output State: **`rightZero` is 3, `trightZero` is 3, `tleftOne` is 6, `trightOne` is 3, `left` is greater than 4, `leftMove` is 0, `s[left - 1]` is not '0', `leftOne` is 5**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Initially, `rightOne` is 2. After executing `rightOne += 1`, the value of `rightOne` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
