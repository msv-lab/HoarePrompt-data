Postcondition: `left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is adjusted based on whether `s[left - 1]` is '0' or not, and `rightOne` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is not '0'. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 1. Additionally, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0'.
