Output State: `rightOne` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `rightZero` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `leftZero` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `trightOne` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `leftOne` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `n` inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (from `mid` to `n-1`), `rightOne` and `rightZero` will count the number of '1's and '0's respectively in the substring starting from index `mid` to `n-1`. Similarly, `leftZero` and `leftOne` will count the number of '0's and '1's respectively in the substring from the start to `mid-1`. The variables `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` will also reflect the counts of '0's and '1's in their respective substrings. The variable `left` remains 0 throughout the loop, and `leftMove` remains 0 as well. The variable `right` is set to `n` initially and does not change. The variable `mid` remains `n // 2`, and `i` will be set to `n - 1` after the last iteration of the loop.
