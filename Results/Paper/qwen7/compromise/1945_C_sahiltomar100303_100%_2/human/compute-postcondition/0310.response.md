Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` is equal to `n`
- `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`
- `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`
- The value of `left` is 0
- `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`

The `print(left)` statement will print the value of the variable `left`.

Since it is explicitly stated that the value of `left` is 0, we can directly use this value in the output.

Output: **0**
