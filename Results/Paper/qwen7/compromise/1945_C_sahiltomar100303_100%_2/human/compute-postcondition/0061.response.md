Output State: **`rightZero` is 3, `trightZero` is 3, `tleftOne` is 6, `trightOne` is 2, `left` is equal to `mid`.**

The variable `left` is assigned the value of `mid`, but the value of `mid` is not specified in the initial state. Since no specific value for `mid` is given, `left` simply takes on the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
