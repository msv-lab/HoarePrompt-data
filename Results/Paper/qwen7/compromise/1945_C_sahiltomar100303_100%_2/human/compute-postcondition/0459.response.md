Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `leftZero`: Reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `n + 1` + 1.
   - `leftMove`: Remains 0.
   - `i`: Is 0.
   - `rightZero`: Total number of zeros from index `mid` to `0`.
   - `rightOne`: Total number of ones from index `mid` to `0`.
   - `left`: Now `0`.
   - `mid`: `0`.
   - `right`: Equal to `n`.
   - `tleftZero`: Incremented by 1 for each '0' encountered from `mid` to `0`.
   - `trightZero`: `rightZero - 1` if `s[0]` is '0'.
   - `trightOne`: Greater than or equal to half of `n`.

2. **Condition:**
   - `right == n` is true.

Given these conditions, let's analyze what `left` is set to:

- `left` is explicitly stated to be `0`.

Since the print statement is `print(left)`, and `left` is `0`, the output will be:

Output: **0**
