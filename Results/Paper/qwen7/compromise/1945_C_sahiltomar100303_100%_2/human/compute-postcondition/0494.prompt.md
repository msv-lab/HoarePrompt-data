Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if left != 0:
            print(left)
        elif tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 8, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `n`. If `right` equals `n` and `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then `rightOne` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` equals `n`, `left` becomes 0. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`, or the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right` is less than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`. Regardless of whether `left` is 0 or not, the values of `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain unchanged. If `left` is 0, `right` remains unchanged. If `left` is not 0, `right` becomes `n` if the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is greater than the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `n + 1` + 1, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is 0, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `0`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `0`, `left` is now `0`, `mid` is `0`, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 for each '0' encountered from `mid` to `0`, `trightZero` is `rightZero - 1` if `s[0]` is '0', and `trightOne` is `trightOne - 1` if `s[0]` is '1', and the condition for the loop to terminate is either `right` equals `n` and either `left` is not equal to 0 or `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - right + 1`, or `trightOne` is greater than half of `n - right + 1` and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
