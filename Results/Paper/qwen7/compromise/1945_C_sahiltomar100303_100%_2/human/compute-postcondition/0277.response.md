Output State: **`right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(right + 2) // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to `trightOne - 1 < (n - (right + 1) + 1) // 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is decremented by 1. The initial conditions for `right`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged. Therefore, `tleftZero` is still equal to `(right + 2) // 2`, and `trightZero` is now `trightOne - 1`, which must still satisfy the condition `< (n - (right + 1) + 1) // 2 - 1`.
