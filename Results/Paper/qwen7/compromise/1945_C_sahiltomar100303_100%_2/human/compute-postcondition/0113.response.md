Output State: **`right` must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code increments `tleftZero` by 1. The other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `right` must still be less than `n`, `tleftZero` is now one more than its previous value, and `trightOne` must still be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`.
