Output State: **`right` is less than `n` and `mid` is less than `n`; `right` is increased by 1, `s[right]` is '0' implies `trightZero` is decreased by 1, otherwise `right` is less than `n` and `mid` is less than `n`, `s[right]` is not '0', `tleftOne` is increased by 1, and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the value of `right` has been incremented by 1. The conditions regarding `s[right]` and its impact on `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged unless `s[right]` is specifically '0', in which case `trightZero` decreases by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` increases by 1 and `trightOne` decreases by 1.
