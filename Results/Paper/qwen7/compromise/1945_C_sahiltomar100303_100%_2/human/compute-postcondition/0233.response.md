Output State: **`left` is greater than 0 and equal to `left - 1`, and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0'; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The conditions and values of `left` and the character at index `left - 1` in the string `s` remain unchanged.
