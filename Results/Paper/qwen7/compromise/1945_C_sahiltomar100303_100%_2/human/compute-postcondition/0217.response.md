Output State: **`rightOne` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `rightZero` is either 1, 2; `leftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive); `left` is 0; `leftMove` remains 0; `trightZero` is either 0 or 1; `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive); `trightOne` is either 0 or 1; `leftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive); `right` is `n`; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `n // 2 + 2; `trightZero` is `trightZero + 1`.**

The value of `trightZero` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
