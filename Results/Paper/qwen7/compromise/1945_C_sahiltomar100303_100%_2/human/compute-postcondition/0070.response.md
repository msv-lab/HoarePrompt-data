Output State: **`rightZero` is 3, `trightZero` is 3, `tleftOne` is 6, `trightOne` is 2, `left` is greater than 4, `leftMove` is 0, `s[left - 1]` is not '0', `leftOne` is 5**.

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Initially, `leftOne` was 6, so after executing `leftOne -= 1`, `leftOne` becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or given states.
