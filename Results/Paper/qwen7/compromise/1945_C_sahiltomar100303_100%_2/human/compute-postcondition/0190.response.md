Output State: **`rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 1, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `mid` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Given that `tleftOne` was initially 0, it now becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
