Output State: **`right` must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `trightZero` is decreased by 1, `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `trightZero`.
