Output State: **`hmp` has at least one element, `i` is the first element of `hmp`, and the current value of `hmp[i]` is now updated to `hmp[i] + (m - hmp[i])`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `hmp[i]` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to it, which effectively sets `hmp[i]` to `m`. At the same time, `ans` is increased by the value of `m - hmp[i]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
