Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of m - hmp[i] for all keys i in hmp where hmp[i] is less than m)**

Explanation:
- `ans` is defined as the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.
- When the `print(ans)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `ans`, which is the computed sum based on the given formula.
- Since the exact values of `m` and the dictionary `hmp` are not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the formula used to compute it.
