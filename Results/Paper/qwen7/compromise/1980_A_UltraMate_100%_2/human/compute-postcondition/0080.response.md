Output State: **`i` is 'A', `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` is the value of `ans` before the addition plus the value of `m`.**

The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. Since no specific initial value for `ans` was given, we can only say that `ans` is now its original value plus `m`. The variables `i` and `hmp` remain unchanged from their initial state.
