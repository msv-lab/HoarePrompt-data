Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), and a string \( a \) consisting of \( n \) characters from 'A' to 'G'. It then calculates the sum of \( m - \text{count}(i) \) for all unique characters \( i \) in the string \( a \) where the count of \( i \) is less than \( m \). Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case.**
