Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in p:`. Here, `i` is the variable being iterated over, and `p` is the iterable.

2. **Understand the iterable `p`**: The value of `p` is given as `'ABCDEFG'`, which is a string containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over each character in `p`, the initial value of `i` should be the first character in `p`.

4. **List the objects that need adjustment**: The only object in the loop head is `i`, and it needs to be set to the first character in `p`.

5. **Adjust the state**: Given that `p` is `'ABCDEFG'`, the first character is 'A'. Therefore, `i` should be set to 'A'.

6. **Maintain other states**: The other states (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `ans`, and `hmp`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be 'A'.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 'A'**
