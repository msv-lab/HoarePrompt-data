Output State: **`ans` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t - 1` if `t > 0`, `s` is the input string from the user, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the count of each character in the string `s`.**

The code `hmp = Counter(s)` creates a Counter object named `hmp` which counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
