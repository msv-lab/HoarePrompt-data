Output State: **`hmp` contains at least one element, the current value of `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, and `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `m - hmp[i]` to it. Since `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `m - hmp[i]` is a positive value. The state of `hmp` remains unchanged, but `ans` is updated to include this new value.
