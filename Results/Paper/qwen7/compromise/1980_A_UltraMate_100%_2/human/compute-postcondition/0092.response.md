Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `hmp`. The loop iterates over each element in `hmp`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `hmp`. The variable `i` will take on each value from `hmp` in each iteration.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state given is that all characters in the string 'ABCDEFG' are checked against `hmp`. This means that `hmp` should contain some subset of these characters.

4. **Adjust the States**: For the loop to execute, `hmp` must have at least one element. The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `hmp` in the first iteration. The variable `ans` will be incremented by `m` if `i` (which is an element of `hmp`) is not found in the string 'ABCDEFG'.

5. **Final State Adjustment**: Since the loop will execute based on the presence of elements in `hmp`, we need to ensure that `hmp` has at least one element. Additionally, `i` will be set to the first element of `hmp` in the first iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `hmp` must have at least one element.
- `i` will be set to the first element of `hmp`.

Given this, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`hmp` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `hmp`**.
