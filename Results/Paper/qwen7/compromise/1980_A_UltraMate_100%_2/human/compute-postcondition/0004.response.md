Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is an integer from input, `s` is a string input by the user, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
