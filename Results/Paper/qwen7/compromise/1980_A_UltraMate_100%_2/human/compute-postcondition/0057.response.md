Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `hmp`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `hmp`**:
   - The initial state of `i` is not specified, but it will iterate over the keys of `hmp`.
   - The string `p` is 'ABCDEFG' and remains unchanged.
   - The value of `ans` will be `m * len(p)` after the loop completes, assuming no characters in `p` are in `hmp`.
   - The variables `m`, `n`, `t`, `s`, and `hmp` should retain their states from the last iteration of the loop.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `hmp` must contain at least one key (since `i` iterates over the keys of `hmp`).
   - The value of `ans` will be `m * len(p)` after the loop, which means `ans` should be initialized or updated correctly based on the loop's condition.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over the keys of `hmp`, `hmp` must have at least one key for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `ans` will be `m * len(p)` after the loop, so `ans` should be initialized or updated such that it reflects this condition.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `hmp`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the first key in `hmp`, `hmp` must have at least one key, ans is initialized or updated such that it will be `m * len(p)` after the loop, p is 'ABCDEFG', m, n, t, s, and hmp retain their states from the last iteration of the loop**.
