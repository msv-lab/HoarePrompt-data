Let's break down the problem and the given solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Breakdown
- We have `m` rounds to conduct.
- Each round requires one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
- We start with `n` problems of various difficulty levels.
- The goal is to find the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure we can conduct `m` rounds.

### Given Solution Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n`: Number of problems in the bank.
     - `m`: Number of rounds to conduct.
     - `s`: String representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `ans`: Variable to store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - `p`: String containing all possible difficulty levels ('ABCDEFG').

3. **Counting Problems:**
   - `hmp`: Counter object that counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string `s`.

4. **Calculating Additional Problems Needed:**
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G':
     - If the difficulty level is not present in `hmp`, it means no such problem exists in the bank. Therefore, we need `m` problems of this type.
     - If the difficulty level is present but the count is less than `m`, we need `m - hmp[i]` additional problems of this type.

5. **Output:**
   - Print the total number of additional problems needed for the current test case.

### Reasoning
- The logic correctly identifies the gaps between the required number of problems and the available ones.
- It handles all edge cases, including when certain difficulty levels are missing entirely.
- The approach ensures that the minimum number of additional problems is calculated accurately.

### Example Walkthrough
- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `s = "BGECDCBDED"`
  - Required difficulties: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'
  - Available: 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'C', 'B'
  - Missing: 'A', 'F'
  - Additional problems needed: `2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `s = "BGECDCBDED"`
  - Required difficulties: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G' for both rounds
  - Available: 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'C', 'B'
  - Missing: 'A', 'F' for each round
  - Additional problems needed: `5`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `s = "BBCDEFFGG"`
  - Required difficulties: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'
  - Available: 'B', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'G'
  - Missing: 'A'
  - Additional problems needed: `1`

### Conclusion
The given solution correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case based on the provided requirements and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
