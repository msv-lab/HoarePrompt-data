### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to understand its behavior and correctness.

#### Initial Observations:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` followed by `n` integers.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function processes each test case and determines if the array can be sorted after performing the allowed operations.
3. **Variable `b`**: It stores the result for each test case (1 if the array can be sorted, 0 otherwise).
4. **Operations**: The function attempts to process each number greater than 10 by splitting it into its digits and appending them to a new list `c`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and then reads the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The function `func_1` is called `m` times, once for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, the function reads `k` (which is actually `n`), and then reads the array `a` as a single string.
   - The array `a` is split into individual digits and converted to integers.

3. **Digit Extraction and Insertion**:
   - The function iterates over the array `a`. For each element greater than 10, it extracts the last digit (`x`) and the preceding digit (`y`).
   - It then checks if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in the list `c` (if `c` is not empty). If true, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`. Otherwise, it appends the entire number.
   - For the first element, it handles the extraction similarly.

4. **Sorting Check**:
   - After processing all elements, the function sorts the list `c`.
   - It then checks if `c` is equal to its sorted version. If true, it appends 1 to `b`; otherwise, it appends 0.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value stored in `b`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Initialization**: The variable `b` is initialized as an empty list before the loop, so it is correctly used to store the results.
- **Logic**: The logic inside `func_1` correctly simulates the described operation of splitting numbers greater than 10 into their digits and appending them to a new list.
- **Sorting Check**: The program correctly checks if the modified list `c` is sorted.
- **Test Cases**: The program processes each test case correctly and stores the result in `b`.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the problem's requirements. It reads the input, processes each test case, and checks if the resulting array can be sorted after performing the allowed operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem statement and the provided annotations.
