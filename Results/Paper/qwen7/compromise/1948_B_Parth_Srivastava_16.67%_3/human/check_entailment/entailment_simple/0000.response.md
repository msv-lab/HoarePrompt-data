Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not handle the operations correctly as described in the problem statement.
2. The main issue lies in the `func_1()` function. It processes the input array but does not actually perform the digit-splitting operation as specified. Instead, it seems to be checking if the resulting array is sorted without performing the necessary operations.
3. The program reads the number of test cases (`m`) and initializes an empty list `b`. Then, for each test case, it calls `func_1()`, but the function itself does not modify the array to reflect the digit-splitting operation. Instead, it checks if the array is already sorted and appends a 1 or 0 to `b` based on this check.
4. After processing all test cases, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the digit-splitting operation as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
