Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the original string `a` and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is the total number of elements added to list `c` after processing all elements in `a`, `c` is a list of integers where integers greater than 10 have been processed according to the given rules.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the original string `a` and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is the total number of elements added to list `c` after processing all elements in `a`, `c` is a list of integers where integers greater than 10 have been processed according to the given rules, `d` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of list `c`, `b` is a list containing either the integer 0 or 1 depending on whether `c` is equal to `d` or not.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each integer greater than 10 in the list `a`, it extracts the last digit and the preceding digit, then appends them to a new list `c` according to specific rules. After processing all integers, it sorts the list `c` and checks if `c` is equal to its sorted version. If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function ultimately returns the list `b`.
