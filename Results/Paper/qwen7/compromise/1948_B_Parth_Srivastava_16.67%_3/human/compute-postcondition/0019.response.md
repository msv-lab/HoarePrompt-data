Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each integer greater than 10 in the list `a`, it extracts the last digit and the preceding digit, then appends them to a new list `c` according to specific rules. After processing all integers, it sorts the list `c` and checks if `c` is equal to its sorted version. If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function ultimately returns the list `b`.**
