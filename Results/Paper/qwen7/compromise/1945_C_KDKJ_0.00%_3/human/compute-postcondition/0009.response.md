Output State: `satisfy` is 0, `ans` is the index `i` that minimizes the difference between `i` and `n/2` while satisfying the condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, where `left` is the count of '0's up to index `i`, `lsum` is the total count of '0's plus '1's up to index `i`, `right` is the count of '1's from index `i+1` to the end, and `rsum` is the total number of characters minus `lsum`.
