Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `S` is a list containing `n+1` sublists. The first sublist is `[0, 0]`, and each subsequent sublist contains two integers where the first integer is the count of '0's encountered up to that point in the string `a`, and the second integer is the count of '1's encountered up to that point.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `S`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The output state includes all the unchanged variables and the new state of `ans`.
