Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the optimal position \(i\) for a road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side of the street. The goal is to find the position that minimizes the absolute difference between \(i\) and \(n/2\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly computes the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each house.
   - It iterates through each possible position \(i\) and checks if placing the road after house \(i\) satisfies the condition for both sides.
   - If the conditions are met, it updates the answer to the current position \(i\) if it is closer to \(n/2\) or equal to the current closest position.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

4. **Overall Program Behavior**:
   - The program correctly processes each test case by determining the optimal position for the road.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the conditions for satisfaction are checked and the optimal position is found.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as expected.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
