Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.
- It then compares `x` and `y` and prints the minimum value followed by the maximum value.
- The logic inside the loop checks if `x > y` and prints accordingly. If `x <= y`, it prints `y` followed by `x`, which is the correct order for the minimum and maximum values.

Given this analysis, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
