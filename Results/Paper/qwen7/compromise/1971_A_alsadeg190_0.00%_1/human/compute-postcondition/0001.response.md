State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.
2. The loop `for i in range(x):` will execute as long as `x` is a positive integer.
3. Before the loop starts, `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting value of the range function).
4. Since the loop depends on `x` being a positive integer, `x` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 0, `x` must be greater than 0, and `t` remains as given since it does not affect the loop's execution.
