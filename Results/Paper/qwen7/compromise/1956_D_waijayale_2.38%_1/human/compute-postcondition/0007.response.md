Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It then calls another function `func_2` with the list `a`, which returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`. The function prints `s` and `m`, and for each operation in `ops`, it prints the indices `l+1` and `r+1`. After completing these actions, the function concludes without returning any value.**
