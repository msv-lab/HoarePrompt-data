You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)
    if a[l] != r - l + 1:
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
        func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)

#Function 2:
def func_2(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []

    recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)
    return (sum(a), len(ops), ops)

#Function 3:
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
    else:
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if pos != l:
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        if pos != r:
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)

#Function 4:
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (s, m, ops) = func_2(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the user. It then calls another function `func_2` with the list `a`, which returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`. The function prints `s` and `m`, and for each operation in `ops`, it prints the indices `l+1` and `r+1`. After completing these actions, the function concludes without returning any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have an array `a` of integers.
   - We can perform operations where we choose a subarray `[l, r]` and set all elements in this subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Functions Breakdown**:
   - **func_1**: This function is supposed to set all elements in the subarray `[l, r]` to the MEX of that subarray. However, the implementation seems incomplete and might not work as intended.
   - **func_2**: This function initializes the process and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum**: This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray `[l, r]`. If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\), it sets all elements to \(r - l + 1\). Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively maximizes the left and right parts.
   - **func_3**: This function reads input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - **func_1**: The function is incomplete and does not correctly compute the MEX and update the array.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum**: The logic to find the MEX and update the array is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that setting all elements to the maximum value in the subarray will maximize the sum, which is not always true.
   - **Overall Logic**: The approach to finding the MEX and updating the array is not correct. The MEX should be computed properly, and the array should be updated accordingly to ensure the maximum sum.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified in the functions, particularly in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, the program is not correctly solving the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
