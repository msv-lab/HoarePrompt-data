Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly handles the base case where `l == r`. If `a[l]` is not zero, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends the operation to `ops`. For the case where `l < r`, it recursively processes the range `[l, r]` and ensures that the elements within this range are set to `r - l + 1` if they do not already match this value. This helps in maximizing the sum of the array by setting all elements in a range to the highest possible value within that range.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array. It then returns the sum of the array, the length of the operations list, and the operations list itself. The function `func_2` ensures that the operations are recorded and the final state of the array is correct.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**: This function correctly identifies the range `[l, r]` and processes it by setting all elements to `r - l + 1` if the sum of the range is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the range and recursively processes the subranges excluding the position of the maximum value. This ensures that the sum of the array is maximized by setting elements to the highest possible value within each range.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the necessary outputs, and prints them along with the operations. It correctly handles the input and output as per the problem statement.

Given the detailed analysis of each function, the overall logic of the program correctly maximizes the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations and recording the necessary operations in the `ops` list. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
