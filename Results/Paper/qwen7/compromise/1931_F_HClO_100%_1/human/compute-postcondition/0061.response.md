Output State: **We break out of the loop or if statement we were inside.**

Explanation: The code `break` is used to exit the innermost loop or if-else statement. Since there are no variables being updated or modified by this statement, the only change is that we exit the current loop or conditional block. All other variables retain their previous states.
