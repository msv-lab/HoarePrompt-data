Postcondition: `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `i + max(p1, p2)`, `m` equals 2, the list `val` is updated with integers from the input, and `a3` is the first element of the unpacked list while `l3` contains the rest of the elements. The index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`.
