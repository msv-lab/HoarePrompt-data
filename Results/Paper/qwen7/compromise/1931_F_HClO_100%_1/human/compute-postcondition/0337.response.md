Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable mentioned here is `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. This means `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `m` is 2.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 2. Since `m` is currently 2, it needs to be incremented to at least 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final State**: After incrementing `m` to 3, the condition `m - 2 > 0` will be satisfied, allowing the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`m` is 3**
