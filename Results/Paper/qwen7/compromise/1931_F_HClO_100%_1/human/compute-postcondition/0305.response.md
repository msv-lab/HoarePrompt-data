Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `val` is a list containing two tuples `[(a3, l3)]`, `_` is `m - 2`**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple `(a3, l3)`. After appending, `val` now contains two tuples. All other variables remain unchanged.
