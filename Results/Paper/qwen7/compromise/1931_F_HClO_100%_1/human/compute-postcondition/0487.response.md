Postcondition: `val` must still contain more pairs. If `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that filters out elements not equal to `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to the filtered list, then nothing changes regarding the condition that `val` must still contain more pairs.
