Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers. For each test case, it checks if certain conditions are met and modifies the lists accordingly. If all conditions are satisfied without any contradictions, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function ensures that for each element `a3` and its corresponding list `l3` in a validation list `val`, the list `l3` matches the modified list `l` after removing `a3`.**
