Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for (a3, l3) in val:`. This means the loop will iterate over each tuple in the list `val`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `val`**: According to the provided state before the loop, `val` contains `m-2` tuples, each consisting of an `a3` and corresponding `l3` from each iteration. Since `m` is initially less than or equal to 2, `val` will have 0 or 1 tuples if `m` is 2, or 1 tuple if `m` is 1.

3. **Initial values of loop variables**: In the loop head, `a3` and `l3` are the variables being iterated over. Each tuple in `val` will assign a value to `a3` and `l3` in each iteration.

4. **Adjusting the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `val` contains at least one tuple. Given that `m` is initially less than or equal to 2, we need to ensure `m` is at least 1 so that `val` has at least one tuple.

5. **Final state after the loop**: The variable `_` will be set to `m-2` after the loop completes, indicating the number of iterations performed. Since `m` is initially less than or equal to 2, `_` will be 0 or 1.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple (a3, l3), `_` is 0 or 1**.
