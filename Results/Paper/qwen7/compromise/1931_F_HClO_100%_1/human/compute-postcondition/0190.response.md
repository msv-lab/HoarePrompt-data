Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be at least 5.
- The loop runs `m-2` times, taking inputs but not storing or using them.
- After the loop, `t` remains 1.
- `val` consists of `m-2` tuples, each with an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers.
- `n` retains its original input integer value.
- `a1` retains the integer value read from input in the first iteration.
- `a2` retains the integer value read from input in the second iteration.
- `l11` retains the list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`.
- `l22` retains the list comprehension resulting in a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
