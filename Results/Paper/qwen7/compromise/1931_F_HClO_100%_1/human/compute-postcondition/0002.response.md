Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
