Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value of `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` is set to `i` if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0, and `idx2` is set to `i` if `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Both `p1` and `p2` remain 1.
   - If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, we break out of the loop.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The conditions involving `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` do not change the loop control variables directly.

5. **New State**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - The conditions involving `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration**.
