Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` remains as the integer read from input in the first iteration, `a2` remains as the integer read from input in the second iteration, `l11` remains as the list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` remains as the list comprehension resulting in a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, either `idx1` is `i + 1` and `p1` is 1, or `idx2` is `i + 1` and `p2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is encountered, it means that we exit the loop or conditional block without any further changes to the variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged except for the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
