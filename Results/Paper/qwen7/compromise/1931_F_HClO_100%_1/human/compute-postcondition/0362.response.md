Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, the elements at indices `i + p1` in lists `l1` and `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal to `a2` and `a1`, respectively, and the value of `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`.**

Explanation: The line `idx1 = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 0) to `idx1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
