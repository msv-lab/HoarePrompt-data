Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` is met, or if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
