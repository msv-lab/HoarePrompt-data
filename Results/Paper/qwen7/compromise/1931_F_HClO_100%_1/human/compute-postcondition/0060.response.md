Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `idx1` is `-1` or `i`, `idx2` is `-1` or `i`, `p1` is `1` or `0`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `n` is greater than `1`, and either both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to `0` (in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement) or the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is met and we break out of the loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` from its previous value.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - The other variables (`idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged unless they are modified inside the loop body, but since no such modifications are mentioned, they stay the same.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement remain the same.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`idx1` is `-1` or `i + 1`, `idx2` is `-1` or `i + 1`, `p1` is `1` or `0`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `n` is greater than `1`, and either both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to `0` (in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement) or the condition `l1[i + 1 + p1] != l2[i + 1 + p2]` is met and we break out of the loop or if statement.**
