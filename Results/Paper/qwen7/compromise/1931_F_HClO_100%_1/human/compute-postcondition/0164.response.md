Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(a3, l3)` from the iterable `val`.

2. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `val` has at least one tuple remaining.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `val` must have at least one tuple.
   - `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`.

4. **Condition for breaking out of the loop**: If `l3` is not equal to a list containing elements of `l` excluding `a3`, then the loop breaks. Otherwise, no action is taken regarding `a3` and `l3`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `val` has at least one tuple, `val` must still have at least one tuple.
   - `a3` will be updated to the first element of the next tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` will be updated to the second element of the next tuple in `val`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `val` still has at least one tuple, and `a3` and `l3` are updated accordingly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`val` must have at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`**.
