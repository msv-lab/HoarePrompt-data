Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`. Therefore, the variables that need to be considered are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 0` because `range(n - 1)` generates values from `0` to `n - 2`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be set to `0`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`idx1`, `idx2`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
