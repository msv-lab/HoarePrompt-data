Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple (a3, l3), `_` is 0 or 1, and the current value of `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that excludes all elements of `a3` from `l`.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, the initial conditions remain unchanged.
