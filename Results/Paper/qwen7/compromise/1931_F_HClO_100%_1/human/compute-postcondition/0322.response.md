Output State: **We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the loop or conditional block it is within to terminate. Since there are no variables defined or modified before the `break` statement, the only information we can provide is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
