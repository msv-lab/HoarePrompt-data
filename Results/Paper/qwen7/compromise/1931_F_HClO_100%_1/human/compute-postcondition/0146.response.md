Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`)**.

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple with elements `a3` and `l3`. After appending, `val` now contains two tuples: the first tuple remains the same, and the second tuple is `(a3, l3)`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
