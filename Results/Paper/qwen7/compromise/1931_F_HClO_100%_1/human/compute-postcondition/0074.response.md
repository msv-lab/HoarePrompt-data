Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx1` is equal to `i` if `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0, and `idx2` is equal to `i` if `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0. Both `p1` and `p2` remain 1.**
