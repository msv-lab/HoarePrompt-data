Output State: **`idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2, `p1` is 1 or 0, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than i + max(p1, p2), `idx1` is less than `idx2`, and the list `val` now contains the element `a2` at index `idx1`.**

This means that the list `val` has been modified by inserting the element `a2` at the index `idx1`, which is `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
