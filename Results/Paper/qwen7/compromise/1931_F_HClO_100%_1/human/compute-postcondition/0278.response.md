Output State: **`idx2` is `n - 2`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, and `p2` is 1, and we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to jump back to the beginning of the loop, skipping any remaining code in the current iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The condition `idx1 >= idx2` still holds true, and `m` equals 2.
