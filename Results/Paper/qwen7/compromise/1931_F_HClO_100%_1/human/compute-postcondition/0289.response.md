Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `a3` is an integer read from input, `l3` is a list of integers read from input, and `l` is a list equal to `l2`.**

Explanation: The code `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. No other variables are affected. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p2`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.
