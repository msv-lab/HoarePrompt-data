Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `a3` is an integer read from input, `l3` is a list of integers read from input, `l` is `l1`.**

The code `l = l1` simply assigns the value of `l1` to the variable `l`. This does not change the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p2`, `a3`, or `l3`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
