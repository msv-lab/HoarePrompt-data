Output State: **`t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is an input integer, `a1` is an integer read from input, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is an integer read from input, `l22` is a list comprehension resulting in a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` which contains only the elements of `l2` that are not equal to `a1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
