Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and equals 1, and the program continues to wait for user input.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables or affect the initial conditions. It simply moves to the next iteration of a loop (if the code was inside one). Since no such loop context is provided, the only valid interpretation is that the program continues to wait for user input as before.
