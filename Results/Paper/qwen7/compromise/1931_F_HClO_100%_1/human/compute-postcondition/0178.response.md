Output State: **`t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is an input integer, `a1` is an integer read from input and `l1` is a list of integers read from input, and the program continues the loop or iteration it was inside, as `m` equals 1.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts them to integers. The first element is assigned to `a1`, and the rest are assigned to `l1` as a list. The values of `t`, `val`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the program continues the loop or iteration it was inside.
