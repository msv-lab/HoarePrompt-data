Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, in which case the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Additionally, the elements at indices `i + p1` in list `l1` and `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal to `a2` and `a1`, respectively. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `p1` is 1. Otherwise, `p2` is 1 and `idx2` is 0.
