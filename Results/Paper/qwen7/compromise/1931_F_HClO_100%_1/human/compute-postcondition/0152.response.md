Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the tuple `(a3, l3)` from the list `val`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `a3` is the first element of the tuple `(a3, l3)`.
   - `l3` is the second element of the tuple `(a3, l3)`.

3. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The list `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, where `m` is greater than or equal to 2 plus the number of iterations the loop has executed.
   - This means that `val` must have at least one tuple for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the tuples in `val`, the initial state of `a3` and `l3` can be any valid values from the first tuple in `val`.
   - We need to ensure that `val` has at least one tuple for the loop to start.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `val` must have at least one tuple.
- `a3` and `l3` can be any values from the first tuple in `val`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`val` must have at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`**.
