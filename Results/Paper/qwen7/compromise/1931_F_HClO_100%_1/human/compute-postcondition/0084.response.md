Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` is 1, `p2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `a1` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `a2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code sets `p1` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous values.
