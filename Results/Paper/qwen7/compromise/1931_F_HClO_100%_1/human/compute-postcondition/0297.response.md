Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The variables involved here are `_` (which is just a placeholder), `m`, and the loop itself.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state given is that `idx1` and `idx2` are both `n - 2`, and `p2` is 1. Additionally, there are postconditions based on the values of `idx1` and `idx2`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `m - 2` iterations. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 2. This is because the loop runs from `0` to `m - 3`, inclusive, which means `m - 2` iterations.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `m` is greater than 2.

Given the postconditions and the loop condition, the only variable that needs adjustment is `m`.

**Final State**:
- `idx1` and `idx2` are both `n - 2`.
- `p2` is 1.
- `m` must be greater than 2.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are both `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2**.
