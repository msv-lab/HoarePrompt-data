State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine the number of iterations.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a non-negative integer, but since the loop is inclusive of 0 (it will run 0 times if `t` is 0), we need to ensure `t` is strictly greater than 0 for the loop to run at least once.
3. No other variables or states outside the loop head (`_`) need adjustment as they are not referenced within the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.
