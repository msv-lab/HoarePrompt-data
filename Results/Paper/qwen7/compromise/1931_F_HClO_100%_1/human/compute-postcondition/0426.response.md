Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and `val` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `idx2 = n - 2` updates the value of `idx2` to be `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
