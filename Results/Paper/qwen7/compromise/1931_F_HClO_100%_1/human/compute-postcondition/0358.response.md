Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and either the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or the sum does not equal `n - 1`, in which case the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Additionally, the elements at indices `i + p1` in lists `l1` and `l2` are not equal to `a2` and `a1`, respectively.
