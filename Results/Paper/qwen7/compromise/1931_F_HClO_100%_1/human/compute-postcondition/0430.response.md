Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and `val` is an empty list, `l2` has a new element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value `a2` into the list `l2` at the index `idx1`. Since `idx1` is equal to `n - 2`, the value `a2` is inserted at position `n - 2` in the list `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
