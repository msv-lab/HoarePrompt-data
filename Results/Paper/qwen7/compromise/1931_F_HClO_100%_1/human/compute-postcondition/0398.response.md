Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(n - 1)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`, and `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2 if the loop were to continue.

4. **Determine the Condition for Continuing the Loop**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the condition `i < n - 1` will be true if `n > 2`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue (since `i` is now 2 and `i < n - 1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**.
