Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Parity:**
   - The condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` checks if the total number of moves (`b`) and the desired number of cubes (`c`) have the same parity (both even or both odd). However, this alone is not sufficient to determine if the desired configuration is possible.
   
2. **Missing Consideration of Positive Moves:**
   - The program should consider that every move either adds or removes one cube. Therefore, the difference between `b` and `c` must be even for the operation to be possible since each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1.

3. **Simpler and Correct Logic:**
   - A simpler and more correct approach would be to check if the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is even. This ensures that the number of moves can balance out to achieve the desired number of cubes.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if abs(b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the absolute difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which is the correct condition for the operations to be possible.
