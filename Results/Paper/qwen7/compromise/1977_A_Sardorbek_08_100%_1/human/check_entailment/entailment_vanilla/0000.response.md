Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop from `0` to `a-1`.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `b` equals `c`. If true, it prints 'YES'. This condition is correct because if the number of moves (`b`) equals the number of cubes (`c`), then it is possible to have exactly `c` cubes.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'. This condition is also correct because if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, it is impossible to achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - The program then checks if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). If they do, it prints 'Yes'. This condition is incorrect because having the same parity does not guarantee that `b` can be transformed into `c` through the allowed operations (adding or removing one cube at a time).
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'. This part is correct but redundant since the previous conditions cover all possibilities.

### Correctness Check:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `b = 3`, `c = 3`
  - `b == c` is true, so it prints 'YES'.
  - **Correct.**

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `b = 2`, `c = 4`
  - `b < c` is true, so it prints 'NO'.
  - **Correct.**

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `b = 5`, `c = 3`
  - `b > c` and `b % 2 != c % 2`, so it should print 'NO'.
  - However, the program incorrectly prints 'Yes' because of the parity check.
  - **Incorrect.**

### Conclusion:

The program fails to correctly handle the parity check, leading to incorrect results for certain test cases. Therefore, the given program is not fully correct.

**Correctness: False**
