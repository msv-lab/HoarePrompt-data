Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `a` times, reading pairs of integers `(b, c)` for each test case.

2. **Conditions for Output**:
   - If `b` (number of moves) equals `c` (desired number of cubes), the program prints 'YES'. This condition checks if the number of moves is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes, which is logically correct.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, the program prints 'NO'. This condition checks if the number of moves is insufficient to achieve the desired number of cubes, which is also correct.
   - If `b` is greater than `c` and both `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), the program prints 'Yes'. This condition checks if the number of moves is sufficient and the parity matches, which is correct because adding or removing cubes alternately will maintain the parity.
   - Otherwise, the program prints 'No'. This covers all other cases where the conditions above do not hold, ensuring a comprehensive check.

### Testing the Conditions:

- **Case 1**: `b = 3`, `c = 3`
  - `b == c`: True, so the program prints 'YES'.
- **Case 2**: `b = 2`, `c = 4`
  - `b < c`: True, so the program prints 'NO'.
- **Case 3**: `b = 5`, `c = 3`
  - `b > c` and both `b` and `c` have different parities, so the program prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the given test cases according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
