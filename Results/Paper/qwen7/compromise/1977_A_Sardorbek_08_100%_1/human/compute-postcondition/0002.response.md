Output State: **The output state will consist of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. The specific sequence of these outputs depends on the values of `b` and `c` entered during each iteration. Since the initial value of `t` does not affect the loop itself, the output state will be determined solely by the loop's execution.**

This description explains that the output will be a series of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' based on the conditions inside the loop, with no specific final state given since it varies with user input.
