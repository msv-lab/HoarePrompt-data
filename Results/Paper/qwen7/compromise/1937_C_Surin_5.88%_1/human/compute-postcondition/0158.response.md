Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `n` must be at least 2 (though its exact value is not specified, it does not affect the printed output directly)
- `r` is the input string (though its value is not needed for the print statement)
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is `n - 1`
- `v2` is `n - 1`
- `prev` is 1

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here's the breakdown of the values that will be printed:
- `{v1}`: Since `v1` is `n - 1`, and `n` is at least 2, `v1` will be `1` (assuming the minimum value for `n`).
- `{i}`: The value of `i` is 2.
- `{v1}`: Again, this is `1` because `v1` is `n - 1`.
- `{prev}`: The value of `prev` is 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 1 2 1 1**
