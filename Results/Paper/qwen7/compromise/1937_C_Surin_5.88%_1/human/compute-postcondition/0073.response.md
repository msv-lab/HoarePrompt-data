Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1, `v2` is 4, `r` is an input string from the user and its value is currently equal to '<'.**

Explanation: The code `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 4) to `v2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` stays as 4, `n` remains greater than 1, `v2` is now 4, and `r` still holds the value '<' as it was not affected by the code.
