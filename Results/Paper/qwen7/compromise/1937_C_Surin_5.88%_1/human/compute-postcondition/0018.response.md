Output State: **`i` is 2, `v2` is 2**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is an operation related to I/O and does not change the values of `i`, `v2`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of `i` and `v2` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
