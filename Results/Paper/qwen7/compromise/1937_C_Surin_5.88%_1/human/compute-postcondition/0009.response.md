Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `v2` is 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is actually displayed. However, since no print statements were executed before this line, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
