Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `r` is an input string from the user (no change needed as it's not part of the loop head)
   - `g` is 0 (no change needed as it's not part of the loop head)
   - `v1` is `n - 1` (no change needed as it's not part of the loop head)
   - `v2` is `n - 1` (no change needed as it's not part of the loop head)
   - `prev` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `r` equals '>' or not (no change needed as it's not part of the loop head)

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each time, the loop will execute again if `i` is 3.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` needs to be 3.
   - `n` must still be at least 2 (since no change is required for `n`).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2**
