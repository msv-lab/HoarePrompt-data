Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though `n` is not used in the print statement)
- `v2` is 3

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

From the statement, it's clear that `v1` is not defined in the given initial state. Since `v1` is not explicitly defined and no default value is provided, we cannot determine its value from the given information. Therefore, the placeholder `{v1}` will remain as is in the output.

Given this, the output will be:
Output: **'? {v1} {v1} 3 3'**
