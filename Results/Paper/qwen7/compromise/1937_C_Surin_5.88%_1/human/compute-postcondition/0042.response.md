Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `r` is an input string
   - If the current value of `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is 1. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - The value of `r` and `prev` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `r` remains an input string.
   - If the current value of `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is 1. Otherwise, no additional changes occur.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is an input string, and if the current value of `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is 1. If the current value of `r` is not equal to '>', no additional changes occur.**
