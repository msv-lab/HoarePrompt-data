Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is displayed immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or their states are altered, the initial conditions remain unchanged.
