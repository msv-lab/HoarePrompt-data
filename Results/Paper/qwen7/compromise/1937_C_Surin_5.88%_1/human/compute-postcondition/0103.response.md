Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `r` is an input string, and `prev` is unchanged unless `r` equals '>', in which case `prev` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `r = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `r`. The initial values of `i`, `n`, and `prev` remain unchanged unless `r` is specifically set to '>'. Since the value of `r` is not specified, `prev` remains as it was initially, either 0 or unchanged if it was not previously set to 1.
