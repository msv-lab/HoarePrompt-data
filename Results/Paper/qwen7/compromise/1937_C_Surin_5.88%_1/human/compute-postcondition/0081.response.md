Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `v2` is 4 (not part of the loop head)
   - `v1` remains unchanged as 4 (not part of the loop head)

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 4, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 5.
   - `n` must still be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4**
