Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `n` must be at least 2
- `r` is an input string (though its value is not needed for this specific print statement)
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is `n - 1`
- `v2` is `n - 1`
- `prev` is 0

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Let's break it down:

1. `v1` is defined as `n - 1`. Since `n` is at least 2, the smallest possible value for `v1` is 1.
2. `i` is explicitly given as 1.
3. `v1` again is `n - 1`, so it has the same value as above.
4. `prev` is explicitly given as 0.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 1 1 1 0**
