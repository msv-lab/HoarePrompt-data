Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is an integer greater than 4
   - `r` is an input string
   - `prev` remains unchanged unless `r` equals '>', in which case `prev` becomes 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be 3) must still be less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 4, this condition will be satisfied.
   - The value of `r` and `prev` remain unchanged unless `r` equals '>', which does not affect the loop continuation condition.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 3
- `n` is an integer greater than 4
- `r` is an input string
- `prev` remains unchanged unless `r` equals '>', in which case `prev` becomes 1.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `r` is an input string, and `prev` remains unchanged unless `r` equals '>', in which case `prev` becomes 1.**
