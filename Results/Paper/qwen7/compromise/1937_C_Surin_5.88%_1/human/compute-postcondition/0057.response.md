Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is set to 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (though its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement).
   - `r` is an input value.
   - If `r` equals `'>'`, then `prev` is set to 3; otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `prev` will be either 3 (if `r == '>'`) or whatever its previous value was (if `r != '>'`). Since no other value for `prev` is mentioned, we assume it is 3 if `r == '>'`.
- `v1` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. However, since the print statement does not depend on `v1` being defined, we can proceed with the assumption that `v1` is a valid variable that will be used in the print statement.

Given the conditions, let's consider both scenarios for `r`:
- If `r == '>'`, then `prev` will be 3.
- If `r != '>'`, then `prev` will remain unchanged, but since no other value is specified, we assume it is still 3.

Since the problem does not specify the value of `v1`, we will leave it as `v1` in the output.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **! 3 v1**
