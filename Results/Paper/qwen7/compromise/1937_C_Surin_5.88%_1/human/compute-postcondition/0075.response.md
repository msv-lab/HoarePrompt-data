Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 1, `v2` is 4, `r` is an input string from the user and its value is currently equal to '<'.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or conditions. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the standard output. Since no variables are assigned new values or conditions altered, the initial states remain unchanged.
