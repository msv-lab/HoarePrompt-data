Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `r` is an input string from the user, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `r` equals `>` or not.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are modified by this command, the initial state remains unchanged.
