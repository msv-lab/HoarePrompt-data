Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, `v2` is 1, and `prev` remains unchanged (still 0)**.

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously written output is actually sent to the terminal or file. Since no variables are modified, the initial state remains unchanged.
