Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 4**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that any pending output is written to the console immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or their states altered by this command, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
