Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `r` is a string equal to '<', `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 1, and `prev` remains unchanged (still 0).**

Explanation: The code `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Since `v2` was initially set to 1, `v1` is now also 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
