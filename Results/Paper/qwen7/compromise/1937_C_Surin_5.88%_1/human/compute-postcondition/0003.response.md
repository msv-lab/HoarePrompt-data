Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and converts it to an integer using `int()`. Since the initial state mentions that `int(input())` must be greater than 0, the value of `n` will be an integer greater than 0. The variable `kp` remains unchanged and is still 0.
