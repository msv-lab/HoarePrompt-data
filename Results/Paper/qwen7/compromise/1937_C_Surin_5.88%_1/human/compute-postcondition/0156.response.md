Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `r` is the input string (unchanged)
   - `g` is 0 (unchanged)
   - `v1` is `n - 1` (unchanged)
   - `v2` is `n - 1` (unchanged)
   - `prev` is `i` (unchanged)

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - `n` must remain at least 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the other states**:
   - `r`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and `prev` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `r` is the input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is 1.**
