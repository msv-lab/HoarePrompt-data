Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `r` is a string
   - `g` is 0
   - `v1` is 1
   - `v2` is 1
   - `prev` remains unchanged (still 0)

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < n` must be true.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The values of `r`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and `prev` are not part of the loop head and thus remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `r` is a string, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 1, and `prev` remains unchanged (still 0)**
