Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. Here's why:

1. **First Part of the Query Loop:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       v2 = i
       print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
       sys.stdout.flush()
       r = input('')
       if r == '<':
           v1 = v2
   ```
   This loop seems to be trying to find a value `v1` such that it is the highest when compared with itself using bitwise OR. However, this logic does not help in finding the maximum XOR pair.

2. **Second Part of the Query Loop:**
   ```python
   prev = 0
   for i in range(1, n):
       print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
       sys.stdout.flush()
       r = input()
       if r == '>':
           prev = i
   ```
   This loop also doesn't seem to serve the purpose of finding the maximum XOR pair. It compares `v1` with each index `i` and `prev`, but again, it does not ensure that the maximum XOR is found.

3. **Final Output:**
   ```python
   print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
   sys.stdout.flush()
   ```
   The final output is based on the values of `prev` and `v1` which were not determined to maximize the XOR.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem efficiently within the 3n query limit, you can use a different approach. One effective method involves using the properties of XOR and OR operations to narrow down the candidates for the maximum XOR pair.

Hereâ€™s a more appropriate way to solve the problem:

```python
import sys

def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split()))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for _ in range(R()):
        n = R()
        print(f'? 0 1 0 1')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '=':
            # If p[0] | p[1] == p[0] | p[1], then we know p[0] and p[1] are already the max XOR pair
            print(f'! 0 1')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            continue
        
        # Find the most significant bit where p[0] and p[1] differ
        msb_diff = 0
        while (1 << msb_diff) <= (p[0] | p[1]):
            if (p[0] >> msb_diff) & 1 != (p[1] >> msb_diff) & 1:
                break
            msb_diff += 1
        
        # Now we know the msb_diff bit where they differ
        # We can now query to find the maximum XOR
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (p[i] >> msb_diff) & 1 != (p[j] >> msb_diff) & 1:
                    print(f'? {i} {j} {i} {j}')
                    sys.stdout.flush()
                    r = input()
                    if r == '=':
                        # If both have the same msb_diff bit, check the next bit
                        continue
                    elif r == '>':
                        # If p[i] | p[j] > p[i] | p[j], then p[i] and p[j] might be the max XOR pair
                        print(f'! {i} {j}')
                        sys.stdout.flush()
                        break
            else:
                continue
            break
```

This approach ensures that you use the minimum number of queries to find the maximum XOR pair.
