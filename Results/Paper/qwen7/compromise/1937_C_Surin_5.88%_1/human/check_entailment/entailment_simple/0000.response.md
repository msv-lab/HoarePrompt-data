### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query compares the result of the bitwise OR operation on pairs of elements from the permutation \(p\).

2. **Analyze the Code**:
   - The code iterates over test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes some variables and then performs a series of queries.
   - The key part of the code is where it asks queries and updates `v1` and `prev`.

3. **Query Analysis**:
   - The first loop (`for i in range(1, n)`):
     - It prints a query `? v1 v1 v2 v2`.
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `v1` to `v2`.
   - The second loop (`for i in range(1, n)`):
     - It prints a query `? v1 i v1 prev`.
     - If the result is `>`, it updates `prev` to `i`.
   - Finally, it prints the answer `! prev v1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of updating `v1` and `prev` seems to be aimed at finding the indices with the highest possible bitwise OR result.
   - However, the logic does not fully utilize the information from the queries to maximize the XOR result.
   - The code does not seem to consider the actual values of the permutation \(p\) or their bitwise XOR directly, which is necessary to find the maximum XOR pair.

5. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - Given the example test case:
     - Hidden permutation is \(p = [0, 3, 1, 2]\).
     - The queries and updates do not correctly identify the indices that maximize the XOR.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
