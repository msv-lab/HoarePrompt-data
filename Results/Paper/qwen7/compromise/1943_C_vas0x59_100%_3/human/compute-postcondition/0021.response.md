Output State: The loop will execute `n-1` times. After all iterations, `n` must be greater than 1, `u` will be the first integer input decreased by `n-1`, `v` will be the second integer input decreased by `n-1`, and both `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` will contain each other as elements. This means that the list `u2vs[u]` will include `v` and vice versa, indicating a bidirectional connection between nodes `u` and `v` in a graph represented by `u2vs`.
