You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3, u2vs is a list of length n where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree, and the input consists of n-1 lines describing the edges of the tree.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `n-1` times. After all iterations, `n` must be greater than 1, `u` will be the first integer input decreased by `n-1`, `v` will be the second integer input decreased by `n-1`, and both `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` will contain each other as elements. This means that the list `u2vs[u]` will include `v` and vice versa, indicating a bidirectional connection between nodes `u` and `v` in a graph represented by `u2vs`.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute \( n-1 \) times, after all iterations, \( n \) must be greater than 1, \( u \) will be the first integer input decreased by \( n-1 \), \( v \) will be the second integer input decreased by \( n-1 \), and both \( u2vs[u] \) and \( u2vs[v] \) will contain each other as elements. The variables \( d \) and \( previous \) are the results of the `bfs` function call `bfs(a)`, and \( a \) is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`; \( b \) is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the value of \( b \); \( n \) is updated to be `previous[path_ba[-1]]` until it becomes -1, at which point the loop breaks; `path_ba` will contain a sequence of values representing the path from \( b \) back to \( a \) through the graph defined by the `previous` array.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `path_ba` will contain a list of nodes starting from `b` and ending at `a`, following the shortest path determined by the `previous` array from the BFS function. The length of this list will be \( n \), where \( n \) is the number of steps taken to reach from `b` to `a` in the graph. The values of \( u \), \( v \), \( u2vs \), \( d \), and \( previous \) will remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, and `a` and `b` will still hold the results of `func_1(d)`.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: The variable `ci` is equal to `ci + (ci + 1)`, which simplifies to `2 * ci + 1`. The list `ops` contains tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`, inclusive. All other variables (`u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, `path_ba`) retain their initial values.
    else :
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]
        c2 = path_ba[ci2]
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `path_ba` must have at least 3 elements, `i` will be equal to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, `ops` will be a list containing tuples where the first element alternates between `c1` and `c2`, and the second element increments by 2 starting from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.
        #
        #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `path_ba` will still have at least 3 elements. The variable `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed, which is `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`. The list `ops` will contain a series of tuples, with the first element being either `c1` or `c2` alternating between them, and the second element being every odd number starting from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.
    #State: `path_ba` will still have at least 3 elements. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` will be equal to `2 * ci + 1`, and `ops` will be a list of tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`, inclusive. Otherwise, `i` will be equal to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, and `ops` will be a list of tuples where the first element alternates between `c1` and `c2`, and the second element is every odd number starting from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`. All other variables (`u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `ops`) will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(path_ba) // 2 + 1 (if the length of path_ba is odd) or len(path_ba) // 2 (if the length of path_ba is even)
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: c 0\n c 1 (if the length of path_ba is odd)\nc1 1\nc2 3\nc1 5\nc2 7\nc1 9\nc2 11... (if the length of path_ba is even)
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10³, and a list `u2vs` of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. The function also processes `n-1` lines describing the edges of the tree. After executing the function body, it returns None.
