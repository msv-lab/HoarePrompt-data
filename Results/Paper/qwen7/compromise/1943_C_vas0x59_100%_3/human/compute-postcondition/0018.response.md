Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u` is the first integer input decreased by 3, `v` is the second integer input decreased by 3, `u2vs[u]` contains the value `v` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list located at the index `u` in the dictionary `u2vs`. Since `u` and `v` are defined as the first and second integer inputs respectively, decreased by 3, the list at index `u` in `u2vs` now includes `v`. The conditions and values of `n` remain unchanged.
