Postcondition: **`path_ba` will still have at least 3 elements. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` will be equal to `2 * ci + 1`, and `ops` will be a list of tuples `(c, i)` for every integer `i` from `0` to `ci`, inclusive. Otherwise, `i` will be equal to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, and `ops` will be a list of tuples where the first element alternates between `c1` and `c2`, and the second element is every odd number starting from 1 up to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`. All other variables (`u`, `v`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`, `b`, `path_ba`, and `ops`) will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.**
