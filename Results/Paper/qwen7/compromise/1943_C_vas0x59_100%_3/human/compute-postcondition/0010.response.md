Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u` is the first integer input decreased by 2, `v` is the second integer input decreased by 1, `u2vs[v]` is a list containing the value of `u-1`.**

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decreases the value of `u` by 1. Since `u` was initially the first integer input decreased by 1, now `u` becomes the first integer input decreased by 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
