Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u` is the first integer input decreased by 3, `v` is the second integer input decreased by 3**.

Explanation: The code `v -= 1` decrements the value of `v` by 1. Initially, `v` was the second integer input decreased by 2. After executing the code, `v` becomes the second integer input decreased by 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
