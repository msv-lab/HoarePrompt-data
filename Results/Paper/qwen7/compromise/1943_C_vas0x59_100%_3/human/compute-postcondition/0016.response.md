Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `u` is the first integer input decreased by 3, `v` is the second integer input decreased by 2.**

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decreases the value of `u` by 1. Initially, `u` was the first integer input decreased by 2. After executing the code, `u` becomes the first integer input decreased by 3. The value of `v` remains unchanged as it was the second integer input decreased by 2. The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
