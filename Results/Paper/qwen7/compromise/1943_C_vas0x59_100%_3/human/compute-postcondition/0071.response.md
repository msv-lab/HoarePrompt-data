Output State: `path_ba` must have at least 3 elements, `i` will be equal to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`, `ops` will contain tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every even `i` starting from 2 up to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `path_ba` must still have at least 3 elements. The variable `i` will take on the value of the last iteration, which is `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1`. The list `ops` will include tuples where the first element alternates between `c1` and `c2`, and the second element increases by 2 starting from 2 up to the final value of `i`.
