Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(ci + 1)`. This means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = ci`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ops` has a new element appended which is a tuple containing `c` and `i`.
   - We need to determine the value of `ci` from the context of the previous iteration.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = ci`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to `ci`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `ci + 1`.
   - The value of `ci` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but based on the given information, it stays as it was at the start of the current iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented to `ci + 1`.
   - The variable `ci` remains unchanged.
   - The list `ops` has a new element appended, but since the loop condition is based on `i` and not directly on `ops`, the state of `ops` does not change for the loop execution.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ops` has a new element appended which is a tuple containing `c` and `i`, `i` is `ci + 1`, `ci` must be the same as before**. 

However, since the exact value of `ci` is not specified in the problem statement, we can only express it in terms of its previous state.

Final State: **`ops` has a new element appended which is a tuple containing `c` and `i`, `i` is `ci + 1`, `ci` must be the same as before**.
