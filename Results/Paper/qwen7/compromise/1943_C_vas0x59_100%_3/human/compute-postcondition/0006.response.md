Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[u]` is a list that now contains `v`.**

Explanation: The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list located at index `u` in the dictionary `u2vs`. Since `u` and `v` are both integers derived from user inputs and decreased by 1, the list at index `u` in `u2vs` now includes `v`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
