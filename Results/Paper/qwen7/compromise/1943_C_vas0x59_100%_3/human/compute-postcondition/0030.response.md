Output State: **The loop will execute \( n-1 \) times, after all iterations, \( n \) must be greater than 1, \( u \) will be the first integer input decreased by \( n-1 \), \( v \) will be the second integer input decreased by \( n-1 \), and both \( u2vs[u] \) and \( u2vs[v] \) will contain each other as elements. The variables \( d \) and \( previous \) are the results of the `bfs` function call `bfs(a)`, and \( a \) is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`; \( b \) is assigned the result of `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the value of \( b \); the current value of \( n \) is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or if statement without changing the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as before the `break` statement was executed.
