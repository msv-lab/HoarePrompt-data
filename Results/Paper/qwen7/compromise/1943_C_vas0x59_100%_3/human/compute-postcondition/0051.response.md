Output State: **`ops` has a new element appended which is a tuple containing `c` and `i`.**

This means that the list `ops` now includes an additional tuple, where the first element of the tuple is the variable `c` and the second element is the variable `i`. The values of `c` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states.
