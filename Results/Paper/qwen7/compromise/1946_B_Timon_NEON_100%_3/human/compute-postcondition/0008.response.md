Output State: **`max_sum` is the sum of the largest subarray with non-negative elements, `arr` is the original list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the range of the largest subarray with non-negative elements as [start_index, end_index], `segments_variants` is a list of all subarray ranges with non-negative sums, and `segments_variants` now includes `[max_segment[0], max_segment[1], len(arr) - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `new_segment` plus the length of `arr` minus one to `segments_variants`. Since `new_segment` is an empty list, appending it to anything just adds the second element. Therefore, `segments_variants` now includes the range from `max_segment[0]` to `max_segment[1]` and then the length of `arr` minus one. All other variables remain unchanged.
