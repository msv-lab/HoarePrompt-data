The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. Each element in `arr` is in the range of \([-10^9, 10^9]\). The function then returns the range (difference between the maximum and minimum values) of the largest subarray among all subarrays in `segments_variants` with a length greater than 1.
