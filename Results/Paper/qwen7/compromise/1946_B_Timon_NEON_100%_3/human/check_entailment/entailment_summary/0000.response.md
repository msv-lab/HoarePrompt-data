### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing \( k \) operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Key Insights**:
   - The key insight here is that the best strategy is to either:
     - Insert the sum of the entire array \( k \) times (if the array sum is positive).
     - Or, if the array sum is negative, try to maximize the sum by inserting the sum of the largest non-negative subarray \( k \) times.
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to find the largest non-negative subarray, but the code provided in `func_2` seems to be flawed. It does not correctly identify the largest non-negative subarray and instead seems to be calculating some kind of prefix sums.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly calculates the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - **func_2**: The provided implementation of `func_2` is incorrect. It does not correctly find the largest non-negative subarray. Instead, it seems to be accumulating sums in a way that does not reflect the largest non-negative subarray.
   - **func_3**: This function is not used in the provided code and appears to be a placeholder or unused function.

4. **Given Code Behavior**:
   - The main logic of the program relies on `func_2` to find the largest non-negative subarray. However, since `func_2` is incorrect, the program may produce incorrect results.
   - Specifically, if the array sum is negative, the program should ideally insert the sum of the largest non-negative subarray \( k \) times. But due to the incorrect implementation of `func_2`, this is not achieved.

5. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case, the program should handle the empty subarray insertion correctly, but since `func_2` is incorrect, it might not produce the expected result.
   - For other test cases, similar issues might arise if the array sum is negative and the largest non-negative subarray is not correctly identified.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided code uses an incorrect implementation of `func_2`, which is crucial for identifying the largest non-negative subarray, the overall program is likely to produce incorrect results for many test cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
