Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days with constraints on daily ticket purchases and price increases.
2. The program correctly processes multiple test cases, reading `n`, `m`, and `k` for each case, followed by the list of ticket prices `a`.
3. It sorts the list of prices, which is a valid approach to minimize costs by purchasing tickets on the cheapest days first.
4. The program iterates through the sorted list of prices, determining the number of tickets (`s`) to buy each day based on the minimum between `m` and the remaining tickets `k`. It then updates the cumulative cost `c` and the accumulated price increase `t`.
5. The logic for updating the cumulative cost and the number of tickets to buy each day appears to follow the problem's constraints accurately.
6. The final output matches the expected format and values as seen in the provided examples.

Given these points, the program seems to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
