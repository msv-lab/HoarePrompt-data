### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which are the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the number of tickets to be bought, respectively.
   - It also reads the list of ticket prices `a` for each of the upcoming `n` days and sorts this list in ascending order.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `t` is used to accumulate the total cost.
   - `s` is used to keep track of the number of tickets to be purchased on the current day.
   - `c` is used to accumulate the total cost of tickets purchased so far.
   - `c` is initialized to 0.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each day `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Inside the loop, `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`, ensuring that no more than `m` tickets can be purchased on any single day.
   - The cost for purchasing `s` tickets on the current day is calculated as `s * (l[i] + t)`, where `l[i]` is the price of a ticket on day `i` and `t` is the additional price increase due to previous purchases.
   - The total cost `c` is updated by adding the cost of the tickets purchased on the current day.
   - The number of tickets left to be purchased `k` is reduced by `s`.
   - The price increase `t` is updated by adding `s`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop completes, the total cost `c` is printed, which represents the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the main loop. Specifically, the variable `t` is being updated incorrectly. The variable `t` should represent the cumulative price increase due to previous purchases, but it is being incremented by `s` instead of being adjusted based on the number of tickets purchased on the current day. This means that the price increase `t` is not correctly reflecting the actual price increase caused by the tickets purchased on previous days.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- Input: `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`, `a = [8, 6, 4, 2]`
- The sorted list `l` is `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
- The correct approach would be to purchase 2 tickets on the first day, then 1 ticket on the second day, and no tickets on the third day, resulting in a total cost of `2*8 + 1*(4+2) = 16 + 6 = 22`.

But the current implementation would incorrectly calculate the cost as:
- Day 1: `2 * (2 + 0) = 4`
- Day 2: `2 * (4 + 2) = 12`
- Day 3: `1 * (6 + 4) = 10`
- Total cost: `4 + 12 + 10 = 26`

This is clearly incorrect because the price increase should only apply to the remaining days after the tickets are purchased.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. The variable `t` is being updated incorrectly, leading to an incorrect calculation of the total cost.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
