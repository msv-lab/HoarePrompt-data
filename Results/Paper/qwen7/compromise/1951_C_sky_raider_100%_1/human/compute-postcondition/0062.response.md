Output State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k` - `s`, `t` is increased by `s`, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `k -= s` subtracts `s` from `k`. Here, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`. After executing this line, the new value of `k` is `k - s`. The other variables (`c`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
