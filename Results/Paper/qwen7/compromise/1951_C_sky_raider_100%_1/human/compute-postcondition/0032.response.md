Output State: **`c` is 0, `i` is `n`, `t` is 0, `s` is 0, `k` is `k - n * s`, `n` is an input integer, `m` and `k` are integers split from the input, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The line `c = 0` sets the variable `c` to 0. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
