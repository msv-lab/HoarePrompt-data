Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` will be the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` will be the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration, `t` will be the cumulative sum of `s` for each iteration, and `k` will be decreased by `s` for each iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The index `i` will match the total number of iterations (`n`).
- The variable `n` should still be greater than 0.
- `s` will hold the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
- The variable `c` will contain the accumulated value of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration.
- The variable `t` will be the sum of `s` for all iterations.
- The variable `k` will be reduced by `s` for each iteration.
