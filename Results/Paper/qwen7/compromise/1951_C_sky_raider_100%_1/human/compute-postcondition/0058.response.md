Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `n` is the input value.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` will take values from 0 up to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, it doesn't need adjustment.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
