Output State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is `s * (l[0] + n - 1)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - (n-1) * s`, `c` is the sum of `c + s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `k - n * s`, `n` is updated to the integer input, `m` and `k` are updated to the integers split from the input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. This updates the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `i`, `t`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged based on the initial conditions provided.
