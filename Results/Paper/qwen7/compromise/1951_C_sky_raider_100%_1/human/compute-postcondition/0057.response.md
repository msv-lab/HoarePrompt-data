Output State: **`c` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the input value, `m` is the second input value, `k` is the third input value, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `t` is 0, `s` is 0.**

The code simply initializes the variable `c` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
