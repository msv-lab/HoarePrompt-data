Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged, and only the list `l` is updated to be sorted.
