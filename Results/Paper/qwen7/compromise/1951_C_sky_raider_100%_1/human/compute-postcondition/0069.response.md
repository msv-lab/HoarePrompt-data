Output State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i_prev + 1] + t)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, `t` is increased by `s`, `k` is decreased by `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2` and `s` is updated to be the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`.**

This means that the value of `s` has been updated to be the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, while the other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
