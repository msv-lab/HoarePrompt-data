Output State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i_prev + 1] + t) + s * (l[i] + t)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`, `t` is increased by `2s`, `k` is decreased by `s`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= s` decreases the value of `k` by `s`. The other variables (`c`, `s`, `t`, `m`, `l`, `i_prev`, `i`, `n`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state. The only change is in the value of `k`, which is now `k - s`. Additionally, `t` is increased by `s` twice, making it `t + 2s`.
