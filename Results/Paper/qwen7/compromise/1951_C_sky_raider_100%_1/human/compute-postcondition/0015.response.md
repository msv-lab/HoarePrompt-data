Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `s * (l[0] + 1)`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t)`, `k` is `k - 2s`**

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by `s`. Initially, `t` was defined as `s * (l[0] + 0)`, which simplifies to `s * l[0]`. After executing `t += s`, `t` becomes `s * l[0] + s`, which can be rewritten as `s * (l[0] + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
