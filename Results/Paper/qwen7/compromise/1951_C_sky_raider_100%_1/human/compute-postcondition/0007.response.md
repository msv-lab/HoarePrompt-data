Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the input split by spaces.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Therefore, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since `i` is already set to 0, we only need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (it must be greater than 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `s` is 0, `c` is 0, `m` is an integer obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is an integer obtained from the input split by spaces, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.
