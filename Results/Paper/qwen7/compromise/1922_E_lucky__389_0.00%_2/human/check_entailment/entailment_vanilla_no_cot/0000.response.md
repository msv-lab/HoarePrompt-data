Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequence Lengths**: The program attempts to decompose `x` into powers of 2 minus 1, which is not a valid approach for generating an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic for determining the lengths of the subsequence is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Array Construction**: The constructed array does not necessarily have the required number of increasing subsequences. The program constructs an array based on the decomposition of `x`, but this does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is small or when it is not possible to construct an array with the exact number of increasing subsequences.

To solve this problem correctly, one needs to use combinatorial methods to ensure that the constructed array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. A more appropriate approach would involve constructing the array using a specific pattern that guarantees the desired number of increasing subsequences.
