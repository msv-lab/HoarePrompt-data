Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not handle the case where `X` is a prime number. For a prime number `X`, it is impossible to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences because the number of increasing subsequences is related to the factorization of `X`. Specifically, if `X` is prime, the only way to achieve exactly `X` increasing subsequences is to have an array of length 1 with a single element, which would give exactly 1 increasing subsequence, not `X`.

The program subtracts `2^i - 1` from `x` in each iteration, which is designed to work for composite numbers. However, it fails to handle the case where `X` is prime, leading to incorrect results. For example, if `X = 3`, the program will output an array of length 1 with a single element, which is incorrect since it should output `-1` indicating that no such array exists.

To fix this, the program needs to check if `X` is prime and handle that case separately, returning `-1` if `X` is prime.
