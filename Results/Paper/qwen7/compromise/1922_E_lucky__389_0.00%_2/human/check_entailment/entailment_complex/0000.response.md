### Reasoning:

The annotated program attempts to solve the problem of finding an array with exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. The logic used in the program is based on the binary representation of \(X-1\). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Subsequence Length Calculation**:
   - For each test case, the program subtracts 1 from \(X\) to get \(X-1\).
   - It then finds the binary representation of \(X-1\).
   - The program iteratively determines the highest power of 2 that fits into \(X-1\) and records the position of this power.
   - This process continues until \(X-1\) is fully decomposed into powers of 2.
3. **Constructing the Array**:
   - Based on the recorded positions, the program constructs an array where each unique position corresponds to a different integer.
   - Specifically, the array contains repeated occurrences of the largest position found, followed by the other positions in decreasing order.
4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the constructed array and then prints the array itself.

Given the problem constraints and the logic used, the program correctly implements the solution for generating an array with exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. The provided example and the state annotations confirm that the program behaves as expected.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly solves the problem as per the given constraints and examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is verified.
