Output State: **`i` is at least 2**

Explanation: The initial state says that `i` must be at least `i + 1`. This implies that `i` is at least 2 because if `i` were 1, then `i + 1` would be 2, which contradicts the initial state. After executing `i += 1`, `i` is incremented by 1, making it at least 2. Therefore, the updated state is that `i` is at least 2.
