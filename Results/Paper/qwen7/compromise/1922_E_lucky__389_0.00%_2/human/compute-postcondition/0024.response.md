Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

2. **Current values before the loop**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is at least 1023.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `subseq_lens` is an empty list.

3. **Substitute the current values into the loop condition**:
   - Substituting `i = 0` into the condition gives us \(2^{(0 + 1)} \leq x + 1\), which simplifies to \(2^1 \leq x + 1\), or \(2 \leq x + 1\).

4. **Simplify the condition**:
   - The condition \(2 \leq x + 1\) simplifies to \(1 \leq x\).

5. **Check the given information about `x`**:
   - We know that `x` is at least 1023, which means \(x \geq 1023\).

6. **Determine if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - Since \(x \geq 1023\), the condition \(2 \leq x + 1\) is always true because \(1023 + 1 = 1024\), and \(2 \leq 1024\) is true.

Given that the loop condition is already satisfied with the current values of `i` and `x`, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `x` is at least 1023, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**
