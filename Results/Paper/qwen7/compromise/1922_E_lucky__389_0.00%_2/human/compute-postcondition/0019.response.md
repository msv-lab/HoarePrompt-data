Output State: **`i` is 10, `x` is 1022, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decreased by \(2^i - 1\), where `i` is 10. So, \(2^{10} - 1 = 1024 - 1 = 1023\). Therefore, `x` becomes `x - 1023`. Given that `x` must be at least 1023 initially, after subtracting 1023, `x` becomes 1022. The other variables remain unchanged.
