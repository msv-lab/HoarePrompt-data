Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `x` is 0
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing [10, 10, 10]
- `mx` is 10
- `ansv` is a list containing [10, 10, 10]

The `print(ansv[i], end=' ')` statement will access the `i`-th element of the `ansv` list. Since `i` is 0, it will print the first element of the `ansv` list, which is 10.

Output: **10**
