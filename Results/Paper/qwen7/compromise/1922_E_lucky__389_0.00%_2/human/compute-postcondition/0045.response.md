Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

2. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable involved in the loop condition is `i`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: `i` is increased by 1.

4. **Loop Condition Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1` must be true.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was increased by 1. Let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` was increased by 1, the new value of `i` is `i_new = i + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that the condition `2 ** (i_new + 1) <= x + 1` holds true for the next iteration.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The new value of `i` should be such that the condition is met. Given that `i` was increased by 1, we need to ensure that `i` is at least one more than the previous value to satisfy the condition for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` must be at least `i + 1` to ensure the loop can execute again.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` must be at least `i + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be at least `i + 1`**
