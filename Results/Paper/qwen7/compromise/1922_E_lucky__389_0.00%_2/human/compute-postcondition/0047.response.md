Output State: `i` is 10, `x` is 1022.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(2^{(i+1)} \leq x + 1\). Given that `x` remains 1022 throughout the loop and starts at `i` = 0, we need to find the value of `i` when the condition no longer holds. 

Starting with `i` = 0:
- After the first iteration, `i` becomes 1.
- After the second iteration, `i` becomes 2.
- This process continues until \(2^{(i+1)} > 1022 + 1 = 1023\).

We know that \(2^{10} = 1024\) and \(2^9 = 512\). Therefore, the loop will run until `i` reaches 9, making \(2^{(i+1)} = 2^{10} = 1024\), which is just greater than 1023. Thus, the loop will execute 10 times, setting `i` to 10. The value of `x` remains unchanged at 1022.
