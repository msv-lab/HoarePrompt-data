Output State: `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `subseq_lens` is a list containing 10, and `mx` is 10.

Explanation: The loop continues to subtract \(2^i - 1\) from `x` until `x` becomes 0. Given that `i` starts at 10 and `x` is initially set to 1023 (or more), the loop will execute 10 times, each time reducing `x` by \(2^{10} - 1 = 1023\). After 10 iterations, `x` will become 0, and the loop will break. During these iterations, `subseq_lens` will contain 10 as it is appended once per iteration, and `mx` will also remain 10 since `i` never exceeds 10.
