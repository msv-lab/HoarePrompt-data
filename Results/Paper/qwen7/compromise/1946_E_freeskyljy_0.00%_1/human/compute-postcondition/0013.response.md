Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, either `L[0]` is equal to 1 or `R[0]` is equal to `N`. `M1` is greater than 1, `M2` is greater than 1, and the second last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`.
