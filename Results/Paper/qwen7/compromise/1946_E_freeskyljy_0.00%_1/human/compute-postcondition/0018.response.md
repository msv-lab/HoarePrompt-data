Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `R` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, either `L[0]` is equal to 1 or `R[0]` is equal to `N`. Moreover, `M1` is less than or equal to 1 or `M2` is less than or equal to 1 or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`; `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been calculated using the combination function from the `math` module, specifically `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
