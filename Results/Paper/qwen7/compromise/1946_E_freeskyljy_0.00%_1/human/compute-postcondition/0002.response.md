Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, R is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `R = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `R`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
