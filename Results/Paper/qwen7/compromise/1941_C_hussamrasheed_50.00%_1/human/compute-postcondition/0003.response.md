Output State: The output state will consist of a list of integers, where each integer is the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in the respective strings provided for each iteration of the loop. For each input integer `t`, the loop will process `t` lines, where each line starts with an integer `n` followed by a string `s`. The output will be the count of 'map' plus the count of 'pie' in each string `s`, printed for each iteration.
