Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables that are relevant for the loop's execution. In this case, the loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in range(20):
   ```
   The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(20)`, which means `0 <= j < 20`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: From the postcondition given, we know:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `20` is 20 (though this seems redundant since it's just a constant).
   - `ans` is a list containing the values `[1, 2]`.
   - The condition `j != i` is true (though `i` is not mentioned, we assume it's irrelevant for this specific adjustment).

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented from its current value of 1 to 2. Therefore, the new value of `j` should be 2.

5. **Maintain Other States**: The other states (`20` and `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `20` is 20, and `ans` is a list containing the values [1, 2]**.
