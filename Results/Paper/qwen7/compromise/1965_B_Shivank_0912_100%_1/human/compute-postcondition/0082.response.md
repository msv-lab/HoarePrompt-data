Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is 19 and `ans` is a list containing the values from 1 to 20, as long as `i` is not equal to `j`. If `i` is equal to `j`, the list `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The loop runs 20 times (from `j = 0` to `j = 19`). In each iteration, if `j` is not equal to `i`, the value `1 << j` (which is equivalent to `2^j`) is appended to the list `ans`. After 20 iterations, `j` will be 19. Since `i` is 10, `j` is not equal to `i` in any iteration, so `ans` will contain the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288]`. However, since the initial `ans` is given as `[1023, 1025, 2049]`, these values remain unchanged because they were already present in the list before the loop started. Therefore, the final `ans` will be `[1023, 1025, 2049, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288]`, but since the problem statement asks to describe the output state after all iterations considering only the appending logic, we can simplify it to the described form.
