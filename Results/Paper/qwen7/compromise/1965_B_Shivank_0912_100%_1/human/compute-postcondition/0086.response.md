Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes three integers: t (a positive integer between 1 and 1000), n (a positive integer between 2 and 10^6), and k (a positive integer between 1 and n). The function processes these test cases and returns different values based on the conditions specified for n and k.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each containing three integers (t, n, k) with specific constraints. The function processes these inputs and returns outputs based on the relationships between n and k.
