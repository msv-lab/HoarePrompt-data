Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`, and it ranges from `0` to `19`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `j` is 1
   - `ans` is a list containing the values 1 and 2, as long as `j` is not equal to `i`. If `j` is equal to `i`, the list `ans` remains unchanged.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 20.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be 2.

5. **Condition Check**: We need to check if `j` is equal to `i` to determine if `ans` should remain unchanged or include the new value (which would be 3).

6. **Adjusting States**: The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the condition related to `i` and `ans`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` and ensure the condition for `ans` is correctly set based on the value of `i`.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 and becomes 2, and assuming `i` is not 2 (since `ans` would remain unchanged if `j` equals `i`), `ans` will now contain the values 1, 2, and 3.

**Final State**:
- `j` is 2
- `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and 3 (assuming `i` is not 2)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values 1, 2, and 3 (if `i` is not 2)**
