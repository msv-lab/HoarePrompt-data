Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `20`. However, `20` is a constant and does not change within the loop. Therefore, the only variable that changes within the loop is `j`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `20`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.

3. **Update the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

4. **Check the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that if `j` equals `i`, no change is made to `ans`. Since `i` is not mentioned in the loop head, we assume it remains unchanged from the previous iteration. If `i` was 0 (as it is likely initialized to 0), then `j` being 1 does not equal `i`, so `ans` will be updated to include the value 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 1, `20` is 20, and `ans` is a list containing the value 1**
