Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an index `i` to 0.
   - The loop `while 1 << i + 1 <= k:` finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This is stored in `i`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed as follows:
     - `ans[0] = k - (1 << i)` ensures that the sum `k` cannot be formed using this element alone.
     - `ans[1] = k + 1` ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + 1`.
     - `ans[2] = k + 1 + (1 << i)` ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.
     - For the remaining indices, it appends powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19` (up to 20 elements).

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the sequence `ans` is printed.
   - The sequence `ans` is printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - The element `k - (1 << i)` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` because adding any other element would result in a sum greater than `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Other Values:**
   - The sequence includes all powers of 2 up to `1 << 19`, which covers a wide range of sums.
   - By combining these powers of 2, any value from 1 to `n` (where `n` is large enough to cover the range) can be formed as a subsequence sum.

3. **Sequence Length:**
   - The sequence length is fixed at 23 (3 predefined elements + 20 powers of 2).
   - Since the problem allows sequences of length up to 25, this fits within the constraint.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other values from 1 to `n` to be formed as subsequence sums.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
