### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given example cases.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- We need to generate a sequence \( a \) of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
  1. No subsequence of \( a \) has a sum equal to \( k \).
  2. For all \( 1 \le v \le n \) where \( v \ne k \), there is a subsequence of \( a \) with a sum of \( v \).

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)
```

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: \( t \) (the number of test cases), \( n \) (the size of the set), and \( k \) (an integer within the set).
- For each test case, it calculates a list of integers and prints the length of this list followed by the list itself.
- The list contains all integers from 1 to 20, excluding the integer at index `i`, where `i` is determined based on the value of \( k \).

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Initial Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed using specific values derived from \( k \) and powers of 2.
   - The sequence includes:
     - \( k - (1 << i) \)
     - \( k + 1 \)
     - \( k + 1 + (1 << i) \)
     - Powers of 2 from \( 1 << 0 \) to \( 1 << 19 \), excluding the power of 2 at index `i`.

2. **Verification Against Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: No subsequence sum equals \( k \).
     - The sequence includes \( k - (1 << i) \) and \( k + 1 \), which ensures that no subsequence can sum to \( k \) because \( (k - (1 << i)) + (1 << i) = k \).
   - **Condition 2**: All integers from 1 to \( n \) (excluding \( k \)) can be represented as subsequence sums.
     - The sequence includes all powers of 2 from 1 to 20, which allows constructing any sum from 1 to 20 (and thus any sum from 1 to \( n \) if \( n \leq 20 \)).
     - For \( n > 20 \), the sequence can still represent all sums from 1 to 20, and additional values can be constructed using the available powers of 2.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the required conditions for all test cases. The sequence construction logic ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \) and that all integers from 1 to \( n \) (excluding \( k \)) can be represented as subsequence sums.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.
