Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, the problem requires checking if the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. 

For example, consider the input `2 6`. According to the problem description, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return 'no' for this case because `b % 2 == 0` is true but the logic does not account for the possibility of forming a different rectangle by cutting and rearranging.

A correct implementation should check if either `a` or `b` is greater than 1 and if the other dimension is even, or if both dimensions are greater than 1. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if a > 1 and b % 2 == 0:
        return 'yes'
    if b > 1 and a % 2 == 0:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))
```

This corrected version checks if either dimension is greater than 1 and the other dimension is even, which covers the necessary conditions for forming a different rectangle.
