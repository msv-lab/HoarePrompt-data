Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
2. The provided solution checks if \(b\) is even. If \(b\) is even, it returns 'yes', indicating that Bob can form a different rectangle. If \(b\) is odd, it returns 'no'.
3. Let's analyze why this logic works:
   - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle along the \(b\) dimension into two smaller rectangles of dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\). These two smaller rectangles can then be arranged to form a new rectangle of dimensions \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\), which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.
   - If \(b\) is odd, the only way to cut the rectangle is into two \(a \times 1\) rectangles, and these cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle without a 90-degree rotation, which is not allowed according to the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the function correctly identifies whether Bob can form a different rectangle based on the parity of \(b\).

Correctness: **True**
