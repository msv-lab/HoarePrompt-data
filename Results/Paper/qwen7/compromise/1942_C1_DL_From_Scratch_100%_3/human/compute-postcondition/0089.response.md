Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it receives integers n, x, and y (with y always being 0), where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value are not described here as per the instruction to focus only on parameters and return value.
