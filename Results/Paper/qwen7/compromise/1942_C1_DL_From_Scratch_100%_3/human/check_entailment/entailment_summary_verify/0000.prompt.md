You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers n, x, and y (where y is always 0), along with a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list and adds one more if the gap between the smallest and largest elements in the list is also 1. Finally, it prints the calculated count plus (x - 2) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that the chosen vertices can form triangles with the remaining vertices in a way that maximizes the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Consider the following test case:
```
4 2 0
1 3
```

The program's output for this case is `2`, which seems correct at first glance because it suggests that two triangles can be formed using the two chosen vertices and the remaining vertices. However, the program does not consider the possibility of forming triangles with the edges of the polygon itself.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of gaps between the chosen vertices and using these gaps to determine the maximum number of triangles that can be formed. For the given example, the correct output should be `2` because the two chosen vertices can form two triangles with the remaining vertices, but the program does not account for this correctly.

Here’s a brief outline of how a correct solution might look:
1. Calculate the number of gaps between the chosen vertices.
2. Use these gaps to determine the maximum number of triangles that can be formed.

Since the provided program does not implement this logic, it is incorrect for the given problem description.
