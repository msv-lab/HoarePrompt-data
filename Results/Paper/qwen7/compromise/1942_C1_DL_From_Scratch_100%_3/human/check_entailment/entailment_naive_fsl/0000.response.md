Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that the chosen vertices can form triangles with the remaining vertices in a way that maximizes the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Consider the following test case:
```
4 2 0
1 3
```

The program's output for this case is `2`, which seems correct at first glance because it suggests that two triangles can be formed using the two chosen vertices and the remaining vertices. However, the program does not consider the possibility of forming triangles with the edges of the polygon itself.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of gaps between the chosen vertices and using these gaps to determine the maximum number of triangles that can be formed. For the given example, the correct output should be `2` because the two chosen vertices can form two triangles with the remaining vertices, but the program does not account for this correctly.

Hereâ€™s a brief outline of how a correct solution might look:
1. Calculate the number of gaps between the chosen vertices.
2. Use these gaps to determine the maximum number of triangles that can be formed.

Since the provided program does not implement this logic, it is incorrect for the given problem description.
