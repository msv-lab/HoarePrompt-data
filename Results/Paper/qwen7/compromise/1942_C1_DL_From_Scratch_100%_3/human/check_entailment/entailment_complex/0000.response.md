Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices.
2. The solution logic in the provided code is as follows:
   - It sorts the list of chosen vertices.
   - It counts the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list.
   - It adds one more to the count if the gap between the smallest and largest elements in the list is also 1.
   - It prints the calculated count plus (x - 2) for each test case.
3. This approach is correct because:
   - Sorting the list ensures that we correctly count the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - Counting the gaps of size 1 helps in determining how many triangles can be formed without intersecting diagonals.
   - Adding one more if the gap between the smallest and largest elements is 1 accounts for the possibility of forming an additional triangle at the boundary.
   - The formula `count + x - 2` correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
