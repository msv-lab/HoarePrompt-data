You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of pairs of integers printed based on the comparison of the integers provided in each input line for `x` iterations. For each iteration, if the first integer is less than the second integer, the first integer is printed followed by the second integer; otherwise, the second integer is printed followed by the first integer. The total number of printed pairs will be equal to `x`. The specific values printed will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases (t) where each case involves two integers (x and y). For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9, it performs some operation or returns a result based on these inputs, though the specific operation is not detailed here.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
