Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, x is a series of integers entered by the user during the loop iterations.

Explanation: The loop iterates `x` times, where `x` is an input integer. During each iteration, it takes two integers as input, `x` and `y`, and prints them either in ascending or descending order based on their comparison. Since the value of `x` changes with each input, the final state of `x` will be the last integer entered by the user. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
