Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It reads a single integer `x` at the beginning, which is supposed to be the number of test cases, but then it processes only one pair of integers `(x, y)` without looping over all `t` test cases. This means it will only process the first test case and ignore the rest, leading to incorrect results for the remaining test cases. For example, if the input is:

```
3
1 9
8 4
1 4
```

The program will only output:

```
1 9
```

And ignore the other two test cases, which violates the problem description.
