Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the loop and the conditions used to calculate `suma` do not align with the problem statement requirements. Specifically, the calculation of `x` and the conditions for adding to `suma` are incorrect.

Here's a brief outline of why it's incorrect:
1. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` seems unrelated to the problem constraints.
2. The conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` are not relevant to the problem.
3. The overall approach to counting valid pairs (a, b) does not match the required conditions.

To correctly solve this problem, you should iterate through possible values of `a` and `b`, check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, and count the valid pairs accordingly. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This solution iterates through all possible pairs (a, b) within the given ranges and checks if they satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. If so, it increments the count. This approach ensures correctness according to the problem statement.
