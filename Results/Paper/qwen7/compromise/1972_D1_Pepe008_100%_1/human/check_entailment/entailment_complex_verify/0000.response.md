### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using a different approach, which involves iterating over values of \(i\) and calculating a value \(x\). However, the logic used in the loop does not correctly reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Here is the problematic part of the program:
```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
    x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
    if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
        suma += x
        if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
            suma += 1
```

This loop does not correctly handle the gcd condition and the modulo condition required by the problem. Instead, it uses a formula that does not match the problem requirements.

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the example test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- Valid pairs according to the problem statement:
  - \((1, 1)\)
  - \((2, 1)\)
  - \((2, 2)\)
  - \((3, 1)\)
  - \((4, 1)\)
  - \((5, 1)\)
  - \((6, 1)\)
  - \((6, 2)\)
  - \((6, 3)\)
  - \((7, 1)\)
  - \((8, 1)\)
  - \((9, 1)\)
  - \((10, 1)\)
  - \((10, 2)\)

- Total valid pairs: 14

The program outputs 14 for this case, which seems correct initially. However, upon closer inspection, the program's logic does not correctly account for all valid pairs due to the incorrect formula used.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. It fails to correctly handle the gcd condition and the modulo condition. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

### Final:
Final: **False**
