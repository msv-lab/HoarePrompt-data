Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\), and `suma` is increased by 1 if \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i**.

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\). The value of `b` remains at least 1, and `suma` is increased by 1 if the condition \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i\) is true. The initial conditions for `b` and the expression for `x` remain unchanged, and the state of `suma` is updated based on the condition.
