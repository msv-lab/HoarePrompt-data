Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `suma` is increased by 1, and `x` is equal to \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i\)**

Explanation: The code `suma += 1` increases the value of `suma` by 1. The values of `b` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `b` must still be at least 1, `suma` is increased by 1, and `x` is still equal to \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i\).
