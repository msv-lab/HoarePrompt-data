Output State: **`b` is greater than 5, `i` is 6, `x` is 2, `suma` is increased by 6.**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` increments the value of `suma` by the value of `x`. Given that `x` is 2, `suma` is increased by 2. Since `suma` was initially increased by 3, the new value of `suma` is increased by 6 (3 + 2). The other variables (`b`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
