Output State: **`b` must be greater than 7, `i` is 6, `x` is 3, `suma` is increased by 10**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` increases the value of `suma` by the value of `x`. Given that `x` is 3, `suma` is increased by 3. Since `suma` was initially increased by 7, the new value of `suma` is 10. The other variables (`b`, `i`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
