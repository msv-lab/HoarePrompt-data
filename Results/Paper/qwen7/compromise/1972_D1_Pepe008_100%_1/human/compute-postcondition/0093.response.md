Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `b`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `b` is greater than 5.
   - `i` is 6.
   - `x` is 2.
   - `suma` is increased by 7.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i in range(1, b + 1)`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `b + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 6, and `b` is greater than 5.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `b + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is currently 6, for the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be greater than 7 (because `i` needs to be less than `b + 1`).
   - The other states (`x` and `suma`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

So, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:

- `b` must be greater than 7.
- `i` remains 6.
- `x` remains 2.
- `suma` remains increased by 7.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`b` must be greater than 7, `i` is 6, `x` is 2, `suma` is increased by 7**
