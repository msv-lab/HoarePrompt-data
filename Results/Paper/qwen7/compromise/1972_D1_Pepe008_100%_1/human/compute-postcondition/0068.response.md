Based on the initial state provided:

- `b` is greater than or equal to 4.
- `i` is 5.
- `x` is 4.
- `suma` is 15.

The print statement is `print(suma - 2)`. 

Given that `suma` is explicitly stated to be 15, we can directly substitute this value into the expression `suma - 2`.

So, `suma - 2` evaluates to `15 - 2`, which is `13`.

Output: **13**
