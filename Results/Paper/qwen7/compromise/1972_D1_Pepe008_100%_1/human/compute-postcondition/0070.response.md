Output State: **`b` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 5, `x` is 4, `suma` is 15, `t` is `t_prev + 1`, `info` is a list of strings from the input split by spaces.**

The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The original values of `b`, `i`, `x`, `suma`, and `t` remain unchanged. The new variable `info` is created and assigned the result of splitting the input string.
