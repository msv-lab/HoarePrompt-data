Output State: **`suf[31][1]` is 29, `ans` is increased based on the condition (either `pre[4][0] * suf[31][0] + pre[4][1] * 5` or `2 * suf[31][0] + pre[4][1] * 5`), `pre[4][1]` is 5, `suf[31][1]` is 29, `k` remains 4, `j` becomes 31.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[31][1]` by 1, changing its value from 30 to 29. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `ans` remains the same, with `pre[4][1]` being 5 and the new value of `suf[31][1]` being 29.
