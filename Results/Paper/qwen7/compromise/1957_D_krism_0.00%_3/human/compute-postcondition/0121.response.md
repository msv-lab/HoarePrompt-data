Postcondition: `j` is 2, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `suf[0][1]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `pre[1][0]` is either 1 or 2, `suf[1][0]` is either 0 or -1, `suf[1][1]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged, and `suf[2][0]` is either decremented by 1 or remains unchanged. If `c >> 2 & 1` is true, then `suf[2][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `pre[1][0]` is set to 2 and `suf[1][0]` is set to -1.
