Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 32.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `suf[j][1]` is 1 (since the bit at position `j` in `i` was 1).
   - `suf[j][0]` is 1 (since the bit at position `j` in `i` was 0).

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 31.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know it checks the bit at position `j` in `i`.
   - If the bit is 1, `suf[j][1]` is incremented.
   - If the bit is 0, `suf[j][0]` is incremented.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is 32.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `suf[0][1]` is 1.
   - `suf[0][0]` is 1.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 1.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `j`.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `suf` does not change because the loop body is not executed yet; it will be executed when `j` becomes 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 32, `j` is 1**
