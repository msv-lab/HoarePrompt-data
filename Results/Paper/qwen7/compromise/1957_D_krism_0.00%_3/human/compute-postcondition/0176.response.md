Output State: **`ans` is increased based on the condition (either `pre[4][0] * suf[4][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][1]` or `2 * suf[4][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][1]`), `pre[4][1]` is 5, `suf[31][1]` is 30, `k` remains 4, `j` becomes 31.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 31, `pre[31][1]` is increased by 1. Since `pre[4][1]` was previously increased by 1 in the initial state, it is now 5. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
