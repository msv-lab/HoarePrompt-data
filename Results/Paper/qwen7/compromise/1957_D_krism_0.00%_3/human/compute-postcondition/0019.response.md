Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `pre` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [1, 0].
   - `suf` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [0, 0].
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is 32.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `range(32)`, meaning it will run from `i = 0` to `i = 31`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`, which is 3.
   - The values of `pre` and `suf` do not change within the loop based on the given information.
   - The value of `n` remains constant at 32.

5. **Formulate the new state**: After the next iteration starts, the state will be:
   - `pre` remains a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [1, 0].
   - `suf` remains a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [0, 0].
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `n` is still 32.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`pre` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [1, 0], `suf` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [0, 0], `i` is 3, `n` is 32**.
