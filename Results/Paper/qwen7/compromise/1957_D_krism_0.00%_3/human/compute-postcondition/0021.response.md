Output State: `pre` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [32, 0]; `suf` is a list of lists containing 32 elements, each of which is [0, 0]; `i` is 32; `n` is 32.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all 32 iterations, each element in the `pre` list will have been incremented 32 times in the first position (since `pre[i][0] += 1` is executed for each iteration), resulting in each sublist being `[32, 0]`. The `suf` list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to 32 because the loop increments `i` from 0 to 31, and then exits, so `i` becomes 32. The value of `n` remains 32 as it is not affected by the loop.
