Output State: **`prefix` is [0, v ^ 0], `arr` must contain at least one element**

Explanation: The code `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])` appends to the list `prefix` the value of `v` XORed with the last element of `prefix`. Since `prefix` initially contains only the value 0, `prefix[-1]` is 0. Therefore, `v ^ prefix[-1]` simplifies to `v ^ 0`, which is just `v`. So, `prefix` becomes `[0, v]`. The condition that `arr` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
