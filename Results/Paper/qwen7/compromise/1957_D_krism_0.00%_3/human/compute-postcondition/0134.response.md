Output State: **`j` is 0; `pre[j][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0 and the initial value of `(c >> j & 1)` is 0, the initial value of `pre[0][0]` must also be 0 (since `(c >> j & 1)` evaluates to 0). After executing `pre[j][0] += 1`, the value of `pre[0][0]` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
