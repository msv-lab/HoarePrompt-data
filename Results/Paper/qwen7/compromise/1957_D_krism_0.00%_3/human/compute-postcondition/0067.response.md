Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 31
   - `j` is 31
   - For each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`
   - This means the loop starts with `i = n` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` reaches 0.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 31.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the next value of `i` will be `31 - 1 = 30`.

4. **Adjusting Other Variables:**
   - The variable `j` is not affected by the loop itself; it remains 31 unless explicitly changed within the loop body.
   - The array `suf` is not modified by the loop head; its values remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

5. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 30.
   - `j` will still be 31.
   - The values in `suf` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 30, `j` is 31, and for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range.**
