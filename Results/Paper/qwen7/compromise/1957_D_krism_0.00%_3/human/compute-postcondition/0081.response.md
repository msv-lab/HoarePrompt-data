Output State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 32, `cur` is the value of `prefix[30]`, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31 plus 1, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the count of bits set to 0 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31 by 1 for each `j` from 0 to 31. The values of `i`, `j`, `cur`, and the structure of `suf` remain unchanged except for the increment in the count of bits set to 0 (`suf[j][0]`).
