Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 31.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to 31. Therefore, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than 32.

4. **Adjust the state of `j`**: Since the loop will execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value of 31 to 32.

5. **Check other variables**: The other variables (`i`, `cur`, `suf`) are not directly affected by the loop itself and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition alone. They retain their values from the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `j` will be 32 (since it is incremented from 31).

The final state can be summarized as follows:

**State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 32, `cur` is the value of `prefix[30]`, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range. If the bit at position 31 in `cur` is set to 1, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1.**
