Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is unchanged, `suf[0][1]` is unchanged, `pre[1][0]` is 1, and `suf[1][0]` is 0; `pre[1][1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, the specific variable affected is `pre[1][1]`. Since `pre[0][1]` and `suf[0][1]` are stated to be either incremented or unchanged, and no change is explicitly mentioned for them, they remain unchanged. The other variables (`j`, `c`, `pre[1][0]`, and `suf[1][0]`) are also unchanged.
