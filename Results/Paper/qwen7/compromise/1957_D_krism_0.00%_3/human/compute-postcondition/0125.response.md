Output State: **`i` is 32; `y` is `arr[31]`**

Explanation: The code `y = arr[i - 1]` assigns the value of `arr[i - 1]` to `y`. Given that `i` is 32, `i - 1` equals 31. Therefore, `y` is assigned the value of `arr[31]`. The initial state of `i` being at least 32 remains valid, but the exact value of `n` is not relevant to the calculation of `y`.
