Output State: `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `cur` is the value of `prefix[0]`, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the total count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur`, and `suf[j][0]` contains the total count of bits set to 0 in the same range.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all 32 iterations, `i` will be 0 (one past the last index processed in the loop), and `j` will be 0 (as the loop decrements `j` from 31 to 0). The variable `cur` will hold the value of `prefix[0]` since `cur` is initialized with `prefix[i]` and `i` starts from 32 and decreases to 0. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` will contain the total number of 1s in the binary representation of `cur` (since it counts 1s from position `j` to 31, and after 32 iterations, this covers all bits), and `suf[j][0]` will contain the total number of 0s in the same range.
