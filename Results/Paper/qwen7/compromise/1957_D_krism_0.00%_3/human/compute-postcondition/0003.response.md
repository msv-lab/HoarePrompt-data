Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing only the value 0.**

Explanation: The line of code `prefix = [0]` initializes the list `prefix` with a single element, which is the integer 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, the list `a`, or the list `arr`. Therefore, the only change is that `prefix` now contains the value `[0]`.
