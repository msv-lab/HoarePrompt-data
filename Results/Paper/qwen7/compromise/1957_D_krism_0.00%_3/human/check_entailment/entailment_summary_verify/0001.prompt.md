You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

- Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    print(arr, prefix)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    print(pre)
    print(suf)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list of integers \( a \). It computes the cumulative XOR of elements in the list \( a \) and then calculates a specific value based on the counts of 0s and 1s in certain bit positions. The function ultimately returns the computed value \( ans \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array itself.
   - It computes the prefix XOR values and stores them in the `prefix` list. This part is correct.

2. **Initialization of Pre and Suffix Arrays:**
   - The `pre` and `suf` arrays are initialized to store counts of zeros and ones for each bit position (0 to 31).
   - The `pre` array is initialized with all 1s at the first index, which is unnecessary but does not affect the logic.
   - The `suf` array is filled from right to left, counting the number of 0s and 1s for each bit position. This is also correct.

3. **Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The program iterates through each possible `y` value (from 1 to n).
   - For each `y`, it calculates the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` using the `pre` and `suf` arrays.
   - The logic for updating the `pre` and `suf` arrays seems to be incorrect. Specifically, the updates should reflect the current prefix XOR up to the current index `i`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Update Logic for `pre` and `suf`:**
   - The program updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays based on the current prefix XOR value `c`. However, the updates do not correctly reflect the cumulative effect of the prefix XOR values.
   - The `pre` and `suf` arrays should be updated based on the current prefix XOR value `c` and the previous counts, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The formula used to count valid tuples `(x, y, z)` is incorrect. The logic should consider the cumulative effect of the prefix XOR values correctly.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly count the valid tuples, we need to maintain a cumulative count of prefix XOR values and use these counts to determine the number of valid tuples. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(prefix[-1] ^ v)
    
    # Initialize pre and suf arrays
    pre = [0] * 32
    suf = [0] * 32
    
    # Count initial state
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i] += 1
    
    # Fill suf array
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k] * suf[k]
        
        # Update pre and suf arrays
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j] += 1
                suf[j] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j] -= 1
                suf[j] += 1
    
    print(ans)
```
