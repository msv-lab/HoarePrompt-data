You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` list and prints the corresponding value from the `sum_values` list. Since `numbers` remains unchanged and the loop does not modify any of the other variables (`total`, `values`, or `sum_values`), their states remain the same after the loop execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to precompute the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to the maximum value in the input, which is not necessary and leads to incorrect results for larger values of `n`.

For example, consider the input `n = 1434`. According to the problem description, we need to replace each integer from 1 to 1434 with the sum of its digits and then compute the sum of these new values. However, the provided program tries to precompute the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to 1434, which is not the correct approach.

A correct implementation would involve iterating through each number from 1 to `n` and calculating the sum of its digits directly, without precomputing sums for all numbers up to the maximum value. This ensures that the program works correctly for any value of `n` within the given constraints.
