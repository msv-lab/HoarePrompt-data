Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to replace each integer with the sum of its digits.
3. Instead of calculating the sum of digits for each number from 1 to \( n \), the code initializes some lists and tries to reuse previously computed values, which is not appropriate for the given problem.
4. The code does not handle the digit sum calculation for numbers greater than 9 properly.
5. The `sum_values` list is populated in a way that doesn't reflect the required computation for the problem.

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
