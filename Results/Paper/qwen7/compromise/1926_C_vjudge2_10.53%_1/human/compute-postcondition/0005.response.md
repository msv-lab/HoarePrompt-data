Output State: **`numbers` is a list containing t integers; `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `values` with a length equal to the maximum value found in the list `numbers` plus one, and all elements in `values` are set to 0. The original list `numbers` and its contents remain unchanged.
