Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `A` is undefined, `B` is undefined

Explanation: The given code reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2` and prints the result. However, since the initial state does not specify any particular values for `A` and `B`, and these variables are not used in the loop, their values remain undefined after the loop completes. The value of `t` remains unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
