Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The formula used in the program is \( ans = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2 \).

Let's break down the logic:
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor \) gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period of \(m+1\) minutes.
- \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor \) gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the same visibility period.
- Adding 2 accounts for the fact that the first and last fireworks from both installations could overlap in their visibility periods, thus being visible at the same time.

Given the constraints \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\), the program correctly uses integer division to compute the number of fireworks launched by each installation during the visibility period. The addition of 2 ensures that overlapping fireworks are counted correctly.

The program processes up to 10,000 test cases as specified and outputs the correct result for each test case.

Based on the provided execution summary and the logic explained above, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
