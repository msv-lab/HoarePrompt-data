### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given example.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Players take turns moving through a permutation `p` and collecting scores from the array `a`.
- Both players start at specified positions and move according to the rules.
- The goal is to determine the winner after `k` turns.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function constructs two paths for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions.
- It calculates the maximum possible scores for each path under the constraint `k`.
- It compares the scores and outputs the result.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input for each test case.
   - It handles the constraints and initializes necessary variables.

2. **Path Construction:**
   - For Bodya and Sasha, the program constructs paths by following the permutation `p` and collecting scores from `a`.
   - This part seems to be correct as it follows the rules of the game.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible scores for each path.
   - However, the key issue lies in the way the scores are calculated and compared.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Score Calculation:**
  - The program uses a greedy approach to calculate the scores by simply adding the scores collected along the path without considering the optimal strategy.
  - For example, in the given counterexample:
    - Bodya starts at position 3 and collects scores from positions 3 and 3 (staying at 3 for both turns).
    - Sasha starts at position 2 and collects scores from positions 2 and 2 (staying at 2 for both turns).
  - This approach does not account for the possibility of moving to different positions to maximize the score.

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - The program does not explore all possible moves for Sasha, such as moving from position 2 to position 4 and then back to position 2, which would yield a higher score of `2 + 3 + 2 = 7`.

#### Conclusion:
- The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" because it does not account for all possible optimal strategies for the players.
- The original assessment correctly identifies this issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible optimal strategies for the players, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
