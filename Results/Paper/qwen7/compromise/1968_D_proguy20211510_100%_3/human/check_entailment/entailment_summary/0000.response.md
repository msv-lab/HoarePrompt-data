Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
2. It initializes the necessary variables and constructs the paths for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the permutation.
3. The program uses a while loop to follow the permutation and append scores to the respective paths until a cycle is detected.
4. After constructing the paths, it calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha using a forward approach, considering the constraint \( k \).
5. Finally, it compares the scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic required to determine the winner of the game. There are no apparent errors in the logic or implementation based on the provided information.

Correctness: **True**
