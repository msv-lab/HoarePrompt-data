Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is less than 4, `curr` is `pres` + `paths[3]` * (`k` - 3)**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` based on the current values of `pres`, `paths[i]`, and the expression `k - i`. Since `i` is 3, `paths[i]` becomes `paths[3]`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it, and it is still less than 4. The value of `pres` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
