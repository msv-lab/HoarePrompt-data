Output State: **`curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is increased by `paths[i]`, `i` is the length of `paths`, and `i` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer less than `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `pres += paths[i]` increments the value of `pres` by `paths[i]`. The other variables (`curr`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
