Output State: **`vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of the variables; instead, it indicates that the execution has exited the loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `vis[ps - 1]` and `ps` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
