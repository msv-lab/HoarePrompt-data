Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `n` is an integer from the first input string, `k` is an integer from the second input string, `pb` is an integer from the third input string, `ps` is an integer from the fourth input string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the first input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `preb`, `resb`, `ress`, `n`, `pb`, `ps`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
