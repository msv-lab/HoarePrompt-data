Output State: **`i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Since no other variables are modified by this statement, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains 0, and we break out of the loop or conditional statement.
