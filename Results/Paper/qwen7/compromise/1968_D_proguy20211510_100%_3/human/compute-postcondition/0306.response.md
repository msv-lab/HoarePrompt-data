Output State: **`i` is 2, `curr` is `pres` + `paths[2]` * (k - 2), `pres` is `pres` + `paths[0]` + `paths[1]`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. Given the initial state, `i` was 1, so after executing the line of code, `i` becomes 2. The value of `curr` is now updated to `pres + paths[2] * (k - 2)`. The values of `pres` and `ress` remain unchanged from their initial state.
