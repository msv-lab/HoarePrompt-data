Postcondition: `pres` is increased by `paths[len(paths)]`, `i` is `len(paths) + 1`, `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, `pres` is increased by `paths[len(paths)]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as above when the if condition is not met.
