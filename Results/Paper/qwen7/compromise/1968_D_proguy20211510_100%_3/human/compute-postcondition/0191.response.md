Output State: **`curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `i` is the length of `paths`, and `i` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer less than `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. Since `i` is the length of `paths`, it remains unchanged. The value of `k` also remains unchanged as it is less than `i + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `curr` is calculated using the given formula, while the other conditions remain the same.
