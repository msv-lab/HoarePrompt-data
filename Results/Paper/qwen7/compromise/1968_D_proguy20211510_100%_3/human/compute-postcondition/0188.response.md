Output State: **`i` is the length of `paths`, and `i` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer less than `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `k`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the lengths and conditions of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the program exits the loop or conditional block it was in.
