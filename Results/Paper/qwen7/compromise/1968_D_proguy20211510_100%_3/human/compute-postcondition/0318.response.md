Postcondition: **`i` is equal to the total number of elements in the `paths` list, `curr` is `pres` plus the last element of `paths` multiplied by the difference between `k` and the index of the last element, `pres` is the sum of all elements in the `paths` list, `ress` is the maximum value calculated from `ress` and `curr` during each iteration, and `resb` is greater than `ress`.**
