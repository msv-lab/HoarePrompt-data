Output State: **`curr` is `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is increased by `paths[i]`, `i` is the length of `paths`, `k` is an integer less than `i + 1`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`**.

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates `ress` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`. The values of `curr`, `pres`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `curr` remains as `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is increased by `paths[i]`, `i` is the length of `paths`, and `k` is an integer less than `i + 1`. The only new information is that `ress` now holds the maximum value between its original value and `curr`.
