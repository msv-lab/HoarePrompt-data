Postcondition: `input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, where `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` appended with `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, and `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
