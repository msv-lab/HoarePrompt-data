Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is less than 2, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[1]`, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only causes the program to exit the current loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within the scope of the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the original conditions and adds the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
