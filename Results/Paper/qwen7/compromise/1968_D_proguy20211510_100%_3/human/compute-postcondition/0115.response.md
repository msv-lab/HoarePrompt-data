Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `n` is converted to an integer from the first input string, `k` is converted to an integer from the second input string, `pb` is converted to an integer from the third input string, `ps` is converted to an integer from the fourth input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet converts the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from their original string values to integer values. The lengths of `paths`, the sum of elements in `pathb`, and the maximum values of `curr` and `ress` remain unchanged.
