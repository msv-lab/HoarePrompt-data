Output State: **`i` is `len(paths) + 2`, `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i-1] * k`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pres` by adding `paths[i]` to it. Since `i` is initially `len(paths) + 2`, the value of `i-1` is `len(paths) + 1`. However, since `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`, the value of `curr` remains unchanged as the calculation for `curr` involves `k` and not the updated `pres`. Therefore, `curr` is still `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` but with `i` replaced by `i-1` in the calculation.
