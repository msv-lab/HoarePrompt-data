Output State: **`vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and `paths` has appended `a[ps - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ps = p[ps - 1]` updates the value of `ps` to the value of `p[ps - 1]`. This means that `ps` now holds the value of the element at the index `ps - 1` in the list `p`. The other conditions (`vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, and `paths` has appended `a[ps - 1]`) remain unchanged as the code only modifies the value of `ps`.
