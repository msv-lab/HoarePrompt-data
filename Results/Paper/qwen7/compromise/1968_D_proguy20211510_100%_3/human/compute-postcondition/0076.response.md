Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `pathb`, `k` is less than `i + 1`, `curr` is the last value of `preb + pathb[i-1] * (k - (i-1))` calculated within the loop, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value accumulated during the loop iterations, and the loop has completed all its iterations without breaking early.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `pathb`, `k` will be greater than or equal to `i`, `preb` will be the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` will hold the maximum value of `curr` calculated during each iteration, and the loop will have executed for every index in `pathb` without any early breaks.
