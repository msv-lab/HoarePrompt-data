Output State: The final output state will depend on the comparison between `resb` and `ress` after all iterations of the loop. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, the output will be 'Bodya'. If `ress` is greater than `resb`, the output will be 'Sasha'. If both `resb` and `ress` are equal, the output will be 'Draw'.

This final state is determined after the loop processes all inputs provided by the user. For each input, it calculates the maximum possible sum of a subsequence of length `k` starting from `pb` and `ps` respectively, considering the permutation `p` and the array `a`. The loop then compares these two maximum sums and prints the corresponding result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
