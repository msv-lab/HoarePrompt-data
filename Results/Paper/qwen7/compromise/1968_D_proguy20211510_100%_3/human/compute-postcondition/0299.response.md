Output State: **`i` is 0; `curr` is `pres` + `paths[0]` * (`k` - 0)**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is assigned the value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. Given that `i` is 0, `curr` becomes `pres + paths[0] * k`. The conditions and values of `pres`, `paths`, and `k` remain unchanged from the initial state.
