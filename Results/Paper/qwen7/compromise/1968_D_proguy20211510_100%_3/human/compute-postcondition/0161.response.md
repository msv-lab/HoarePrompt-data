Output State: **`preb` is 0, `pres` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` ones, `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `pathb` contains all elements added until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, `paths` contains all elements added during the loop iterations, `n` is an integer from the first input string, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` holds the value it had when the loop broke, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the first input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state reflects that the variables `preb` and `pres` are initialized to 0, while all other variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
