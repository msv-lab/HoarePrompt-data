Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, and `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `resb` becomes the new value of `ress`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged.
