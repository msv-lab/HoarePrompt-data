Output State: **`pres` is increased by `paths[len(paths)]`, `i` is `len(paths) + 1`, `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `pres`, `i`, `k`, and `ress` remain as they were before the `break` statement.
