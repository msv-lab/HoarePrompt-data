Output State: **`i` is 4, `pathb` is a list with at least 4 elements, `curr` is `preb + pathb[4] * (k - 4)`**.

This means that the value of `i` remains unchanged at 4, `pathb` remains a list with at least 4 elements, and `curr` is calculated as the sum of `preb` and the product of the fifth element of `pathb` (since indexing starts at 0) and the difference between `k` and `i`.
