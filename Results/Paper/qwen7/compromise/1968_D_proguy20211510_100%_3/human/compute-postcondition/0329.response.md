Postcondition: **`i` is equal to the total number of elements in the `paths` list, `curr` holds the value of `pres` plus the last element of `paths` multiplied by the difference between `k` and the index of the last element, `pres` is the sum of all elements in the `paths` list, and `ress` contains the maximum value between its initial value and the calculated `curr` value for each iteration. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `resb` is used to update `ress`; otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged.**
