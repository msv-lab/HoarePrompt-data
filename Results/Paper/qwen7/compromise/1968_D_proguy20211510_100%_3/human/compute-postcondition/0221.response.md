Postcondition: `i` is the length of `paths`, `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`, `curr` is the value of `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * k`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, and `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value and any `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, updated based on whether `resb` is greater than `ress` or not. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, `ress` is updated to the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged.
