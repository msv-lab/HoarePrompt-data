Output State: **`vis` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `pathb` contains all elements added until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, `paths` now contains `a[ps - 1]`, `n` is an integer from the first input string, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the first input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, and `vis[ps - 1]` is equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates that the most internal loop or if statement has been exited. All other variables retain their previous states.
