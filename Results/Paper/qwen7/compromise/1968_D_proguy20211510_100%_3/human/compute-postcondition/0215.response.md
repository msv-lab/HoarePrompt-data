Postcondition: **`i` is `len(paths)`, `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * k`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, and `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`. Additionally, the current value of `ress` is greater than the current value of `resb`**.
