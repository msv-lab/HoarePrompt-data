Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the integer value of the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the program to exit the current loop or conditional block without further execution of the subsequent statements. The values of the variables `vis`, `num_iterations`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `pathb`, and `paths` remain unchanged from their previous states, except that we know the program has broken out of the loop or conditional block.
