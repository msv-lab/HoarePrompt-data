Output State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, where `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1, and the condition `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1 holds true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. All the initial conditions remain the same.
