Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1, `num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` remains at the final value it was set to after the last iteration, `ps` is the integer value of the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during each iteration of the loop, `paths` is a list with the element `a[ps - 1]` appended, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the variable `paths` has had its value updated by appending `a[ps - 1]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
