Output State: **`num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of the original `n`, `k` is the integer value of the original `k`, `pb` is the integer value of the original `pb`, `ps` is the integer value of the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The result is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `num_iterations`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
