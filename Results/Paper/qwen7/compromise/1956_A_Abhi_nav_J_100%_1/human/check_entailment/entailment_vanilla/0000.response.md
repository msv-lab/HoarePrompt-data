Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads:
     - `k` and `q`, where `k` is the length of the sequence `a` and `q` is the number of queries.
     - The sequence `a` of length `k`.
     - `q` integers representing the initial number of players `n_i`.

2. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function is supposed to simulate the game logic.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly implement the game logic. It simply returns `a-1` if `a <= b`, otherwise `b`. This does not reflect the actual game rules described in the problem statement.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game involves removing players at positions specified by the sequence `a`.
   - If the position specified by `a[i]` exceeds the current number of players, that player is skipped.
   - The process continues until no more players can be removed in a round.

### Current Implementation Issues

- **Incorrect Game Logic**: The function `func_1` does not simulate the removal of players based on the sequence `a` and the current number of players.
- **No Simulation of Rounds**: The program does not simulate the rounds of the game where players are removed and checks if any players are left.

### Correct Implementation

To correctly implement the game logic, we need to:
1. Simulate each round of the game.
2. Remove players at the positions specified by `a` from the current list of players.
3. Continue until no more players can be removed in a round.
4. Count the remaining players as winners.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def simulate_game(a, n):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        remove_positions = [a[i] - 1 for i in range(len(a)) if a[i] - 1 < len(players)]
        if not remove_positions:
            break
        players = [players[i] for i in range(len(players)) if i not in remove_positions]
    return len(players)

n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results = []
    for _ in range(q):
        n_i = int(input())
        results.append(simulate_game(a, n_i))
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))
```

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the game logic. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
