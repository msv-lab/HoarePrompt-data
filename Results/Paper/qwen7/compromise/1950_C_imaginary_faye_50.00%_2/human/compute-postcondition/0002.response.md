Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a transformed time string based on the input time. For each input time `s` in the format "hh:mm", the code converts it to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and outputs it. If the hour is '00', it prints '12'. If the hour is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour as is. If the hour is between '13' and '23', it subtracts 12 from the hour and adds a leading zero. The output also appends either 'AM' or 'PM' based on whether the hour is 12 or greater than '12'.
