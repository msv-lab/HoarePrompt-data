Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. It extracts the hour (`h`) and minute (`s[2:]`) from the input string `s`.
3. The logic for converting the hour to 12-hour format is correct:
   - If the hour is '00', it correctly prints '12'.
   - If the hour is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour as is.
   - If the hour is between '13' and '23', it correctly subtracts 12 from the hour and adds a leading zero.
4. The AM/PM indicator is correctly set based on whether the hour is 12 or greater than '12'.
5. The program handles all possible valid inputs as specified in the problem description.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the provided problem description and the execution states.

Correctness: **True**
