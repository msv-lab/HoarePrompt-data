You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

Example

Input

    09:41
    
    18:06
    
    12:14
    
    00:59
    
    00:00

    19:07
    
    11:59
    
    12:00
    
    21:37

Output

    09:41 AM
    06:06 PM
    12:14 PM
    12:59 AM
    12:00 AM
    02:34 PM
    01:01 AM
    07:07 PM
    11:59 AM
    12:00 PM
    09:37 PM

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an integer `t` (representing minutes since midnight) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm". It converts the time string `s` to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and outputs it. If the hour is '00', it prints '12'. If the hour is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour as is. If the hour is between '13' and '23', it subtracts 12 from the hour and adds a leading zero. The output also appends either 'AM' or 'PM' based on whether the hour is 12 or greater than '12'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the converted time strings.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - For `h = '00'`, it correctly prints `'12'` followed by the minutes.
   - For `h` in the range `01` to `12`, it prints `h` directly followed by the minutes.
   - For `h` in the range `13` to `23`, it correctly converts these hours to the 12-hour format by subtracting `12` and adding a leading zero when necessary (e.g., `13` becomes `01`, `14` becomes `02`, etc.).
3. **AM/PM Determination**:
   - It correctly determines whether to print "AM" or "PM" based on whether `h` is greater than or equal to `12`.
4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the time in the correct format without removing leading zeros and separates the hour and minute part with a colon.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `h` is `'00'` correctly by printing `'12'` instead of `'00'`.

Given that the program correctly handles all the specified conditions and examples provided, it appears to be correct.
