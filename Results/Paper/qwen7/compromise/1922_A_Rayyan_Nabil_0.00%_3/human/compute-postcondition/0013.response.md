Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` and `c` are lists of integers with the same length.
   - The first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `c`.
   - The first element of `b` is not equal to the first element of `c`.
   - `l` is 'YES'.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is determined by the loop condition and does not change within the loop itself.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged).
   - The other variables (`a`, `c`, `b`, and `l`) remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `c` are lists of integers with the same length, the first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `c`, and the first element of `b` is not equal to the first element of `c`, and `l` is 'YES'**.
