Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is the new input from the user, `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'YES'.

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The loop sets `l` to 'YES' if there exists at least one index `i` where both `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. Since the loop has executed all its iterations, if `l` was ever set to 'YES' during any iteration, it will remain 'YES'. If `l` was never set to 'YES', it will remain 'NO'. However, based on the given information, we know that `l` was set to 'YES' at least once, so the final state of `l` is 'YES'.
