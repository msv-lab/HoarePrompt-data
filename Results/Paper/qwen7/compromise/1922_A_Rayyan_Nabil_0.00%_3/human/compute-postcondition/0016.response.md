Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `c` are lists of integers with the same length, the first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `c`, and the first element of `b` is not equal to the first element of `c`, and `l` is 'YES'. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, the condition remains unchanged.**
