Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is a new input string
   - `b` is the new input from the user
   - `c` is the input from the user
   - `l` is 'YES'

4. **Condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`.
   - If this condition is not met, `l` remains 'NO'.

5. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0 (which it is, since it was greater than 0 at the start).
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `l` do not change within the loop head, so they remain as they are.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `l` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a new input string, `b` is the new input from the user, `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'YES'**
