Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'YES'**.

The code `l = 'YES'` simply reassigns the variable `l` to the string `'YES'`. Since the initial state already had `l` as `'YES'`, there is no change in the value of `l`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
