Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (from 0 to 1), and `n` must still be greater than 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`, and `l`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
