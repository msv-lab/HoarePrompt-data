Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n-1`, meaning `i` is the last index of the lists `a` and `c`.
- `n` must be greater than 0, so both `a` and `c` are non-empty lists.
- `a` and `c` are lists of integers with the same length.
- The first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `c`.
- The first element of `b` is not equal to the first element of `c`.
- `l` is initialized to 'YES'.
- The loop iterates over the indices from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive).
- For each index `i`, the conditions `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` must hold true for `l` to remain 'YES'.

Given that the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it means that for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the conditions `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` are satisfied. Therefore, `l` remains 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
