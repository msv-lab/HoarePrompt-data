Postcondition: `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on the relationship between the first element `a` of the non-empty list `inp` and `y`. Specifically, if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, `ans` is set to 0. If `a` is greater than `y`, `ans` is set to 1 or 2, where `ans` is 2 if `x == y` and 1 otherwise. `n` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n - 1`, and `y` is now equal to `a`.
