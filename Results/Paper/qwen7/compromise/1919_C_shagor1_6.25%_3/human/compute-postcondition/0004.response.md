Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0.**

The variable `ans` is initialized to 0, but no operations are performed on `t`, `n`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
