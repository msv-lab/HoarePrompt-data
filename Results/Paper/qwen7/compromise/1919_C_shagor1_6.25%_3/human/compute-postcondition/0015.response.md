Output State: **`a` is greater than `x`, `a` is greater than `y`, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is equal to `a`, `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1. Since no initial value for `ans` was given, we assume it starts at 0. After executing `ans += 1`, `ans` becomes 1. All other conditions and relationships between `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
