Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is the minimum value encountered in `inp`.
- `y` is the second minimum value encountered in `inp` (or `y` remains unchanged if no second unique minimum was found).
- `ans` is the count of distinct minimum values in `inp` that are greater than `y`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.

To determine what `ans` is, let's break it down:

1. `x` is the minimum value in `inp`.
2. `y` is either the second minimum value in `inp` if there is a distinct second minimum, or it remains unchanged if no such value exists.
3. `ans` is the count of distinct minimum values in `inp` that are greater than `y`.

Given this, `ans` can only be 0 or 1:

- If there is no second unique minimum (`y` is unchanged), then `ans` will be 0 because there are no minimum values greater than `y` (which is unchanged and thus equal to `x`).
- If there is a second unique minimum (`y` is set to this value), then `ans` will be 1 if there are any minimum values in `inp` that are greater than `y`, otherwise, it will still be 0.

Therefore, the value of `ans` can only be 0 or 1, depending on the specific values in `inp`.

Output: **0 or 1 (depending on the values in `inp`)**
