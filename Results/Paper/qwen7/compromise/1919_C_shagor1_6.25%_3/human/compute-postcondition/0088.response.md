Output State: **`inp` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is the count of unique elements in `inp` that are greater than `y`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is 0, and `y` is the maximum value in the list `inp`.**

Explanation: The code `*inp, = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to the list `inp`. It does not directly assign values to `ans`, `n`, `x`, or `y`. However, it updates `inp` and calculates `y` as the maximum value in `inp`. The values of `n`, `x`, and the initial state of `ans` remain unchanged.
