Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the count of unique elements in the list `inp` that are greater than `y`.
- `n` is -1 (it starts as `len(inp) - 1` and is decremented until it reaches -1).
- `x` is 0.
- `y` is the maximum value in the list `inp`.

The print statement is `print(ans)`. Since `n` is already -1, the loop that presumably updates `ans` has completed its iterations. Therefore, `ans` contains the count of unique elements in `inp` that are greater than `y` (which is the maximum value in `inp`).

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of unique elements in the list inp that are greater than the maximum value in inp)**
