Postcondition: `a` is updated to the next element from `inp`, `x` retains its current value, `y` is now equal to `a`. If `a <= y`, then `ans` retains its current value. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1, and the result of `x == y` is a boolean value (True or False) depending on whether `x` is equal to `y`.
