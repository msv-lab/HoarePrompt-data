Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires splitting the array `a` (represented by the string `s`) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Current Implementation**: The current implementation simply counts the number of '+' characters (`P`) and the number of '-' characters (`M`) in the string `e`. It then prints the difference `P - M`.

3. **Incorrect Approach**: This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. For example, in the third test case (`--+++++++`), the optimal split would be `([2,2,2,2,2], [2,2])`, resulting in a total penalty of 0. However, the current implementation would incorrectly compute `P - M = 4 - 6 = -2`, which is not the minimum possible penalty.

4. **Correct Solution**: To solve this problem optimally, one needs to find a way to split the array such that the sum of penalties of the subarrays is minimized. This often involves dynamic programming or greedy algorithms tailored to the specific constraints and requirements of the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
