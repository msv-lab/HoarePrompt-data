Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program attempts to count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and prints the difference between these counts. However, this approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
5
--+++++++-
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

The correct approach would involve splitting the array into segments where the sum of elements is zero or close to zero to minimize the penalty. For the input `--+++++++-', the optimal split would be `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of `2 * 2 + 0 * 9 = 4`.

The program fails to achieve this optimal split, hence it is incorrect.
