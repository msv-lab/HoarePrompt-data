Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the last character of `e`, `P` is equal to the length of `e` if every character in `e` is '+', otherwise `P` is one less than the length of `e`, and `M` is equal to the length of `e` if there is at least one character in `e` that is not '+', otherwise `M` is 0.

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` remains either 0 or 1 as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop operations. The variable `e` is a non-empty string, and the loop processes each character of `e`. The variable `P` counts the number of '+' characters in `e`, and `M` counts the number of non- '+' characters in `e`. If `e` contains only '+' characters, `P` will match the length of `e`, and `M` will be 0. If there are any '-' characters in `e`, `M` will also match the length of `e`, and `P` will be one less than the length of `e`.
