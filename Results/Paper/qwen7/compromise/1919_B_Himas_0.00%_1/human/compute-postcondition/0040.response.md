Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `q` and `e`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character `q` in the string `e`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `e` is a non-empty string.
   - `q` is the last character of `e`.
   - If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1. Otherwise, `M` is 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `q` is the last character of `e` in the current iteration, for the next iteration, `q` will be the second last character of `e`.
   - The string `e` will be one character shorter than it was in the previous iteration.

5. **Update the conditions**:
   - For the next iteration, `e` must still be a non-empty string (since it loses only one character).
   - `q` will now be the new last character of `e`.
   - The value of `P` or `M` will depend on the new last character `q`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `e` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before).
- `q` is the new last character of `e`.

Since `P` and `M` are determined based on the last character `q`, their values will change accordingly for the next iteration.

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: **`e` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `q` is the new last character of `e`**.
