Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is the variable `q` which iterates over each character in the string `e`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `e` is a non-empty string.
   - `q` is the last character of `e`.
   - `P` is either 1 or 0.
   - `M` is either 0 or 1.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `s` is an input integer.
   - If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0; otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.
   - `q` is not equal to '+'.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `e`, the next value of `q` will be the next character in the string `e`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 again.
   - `P` and `M` will be updated based on the new value of `q`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `e` remains the same as it is not being modified within the loop.
- `q` will now be the next character in the string `e`.
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `P` and `M` will be updated based on the new value of `q`.

Since `q` is the next character in the string `e`, and `q` is not equal to '+', the values of `P` and `M` will be updated accordingly:
- If the new `q` is '+', then `P` will be 1 and `M` will be 0.
- Otherwise, `P` will be 0 and `M` will be 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in `e`, `P` is either 1 or 0, `M` is either 0 or 1, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0; otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
