You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5. The array c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is equal to `x * i`, with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` or 2 if `a[i] <= 1`.
    #
    #In this output state, the variable `b` is updated such that each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the previous element `b[i-1]` and `x`, where `x` is 1 if the corresponding element `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [accumulated sums of the list up to each index]
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer, n is an input integer, q is an input integer, a is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the list up to that index, b is a list of length n + 1 where each element b[i] (for i from 1 to n) is the sum of the previous element b[i-1] and 1 if the corresponding element a[i] is greater than 1 or 2 if a[i] is less than or equal to 1, the loop has executed q times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers x and y from input, then prints 'NO' if a[y] - a[x - 1] is less than b[y] - b[x - 1] or if x equals y, otherwise it prints 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it first reads the size of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `c`. It then updates an auxiliary array `b` based on the values in `c`. After that, it prints the accumulated sums of `c` up to each index. Finally, for each query, it compares the difference between the accumulated sums at indices `y` and `x-1` with the corresponding differences in the auxiliary array `b`, and prints 'YES' if the condition is met or 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the given problem description. Specifically, the program does not check whether the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that satisfies the conditions of being good. Instead, it seems to be performing some accumulation operations on the input array `a`, which do not align with the requirements of the problem.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 4
  1 2 1 4 5
  1 5
  4 4
  3 4
  1 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  NO
  YES
  NO
  ```

However, running the provided program will produce:
```
0 3 4 8 13 
NO
NO
NO
NO
```

This is because the program is simply printing the cumulative sums of the array `a` and checking a condition that is unrelated to the problem's requirements. It does not check if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` that meets the criteria of being good.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is good, making it incorrect.
