Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts parameters `n`, `q`, `c`, and a series of queries defined by `l_i` and `r_i`. It returns results based on the queries performed on the array `c`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving an array `c` of length `n` containing positive integers, and a set of `q` queries. Each query specifies a range `[l_i, r_i]` within the array `c`, and the function processes these queries to provide specific outputs based on the elements within the specified ranges.
