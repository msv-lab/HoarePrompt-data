You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5. The array c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. For each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers from the input, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is equal to `x * i`, with `x` being 1 if `a[i] > 1` or 2 if `a[i] <= 1`.
    #
    #In this output state, the variable `b` is updated such that each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the sum of the previous element `b[i-1]` and `x`, where `x` is 1 if the corresponding element `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [accumulated sums of the list up to each index]
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer, n is an input integer, q is an input integer, a is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the list up to that index, b is a list of length n + 1 where each element b[i] (for i from 1 to n) is the sum of the previous element b[i-1] and 1 if the corresponding element a[i] is greater than 1 or 2 if a[i] is less than or equal to 1, the loop has executed q times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers x and y from input, then prints 'NO' if a[y] - a[x - 1] is less than b[y] - b[x - 1] or if x equals y, otherwise it prints 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts parameters `n`, `q`, `c`, and a series of queries defined by `l_i` and `r_i`. It returns results based on the queries performed on the array `c`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
