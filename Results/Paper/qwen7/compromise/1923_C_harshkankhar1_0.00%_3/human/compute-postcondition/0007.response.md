To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the list up to that index. This means `a[i]` is the sum of all elements from `a[0]` to `a[i]`.
   - `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is determined by the following rule:
     - If `a[i] > 1`, then `b[i] = b[i-1] + 1`.
     - If `a[i] <= 1`, then `b[i] = b[i-1] + 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*a)
   ```

Given the above, the `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

However, without specific values for `n` and the contents of `a`, we cannot provide exact numerical values for the elements of `a`. But we can describe the structure and behavior of `a` based on the initial state.

Since `a` is an accumulated sum list, each element in `a` represents the sum of all previous elements including itself. For example, if `a = [1, 3, 6, 10]`, it would mean:
- `a[0] = 1`
- `a[1] = 1 + 2 = 3` (assuming the first element is 1 and the next is 2)
- `a[2] = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6` (assuming the third element is 3)
- `a[3] = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10` (assuming the fourth element is 4)

But since we don't have the exact values, we can only describe the general form.

Output: **[accumulated sums of the list up to each index]**
