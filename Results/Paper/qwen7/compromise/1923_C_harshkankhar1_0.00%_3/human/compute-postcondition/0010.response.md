Output State: t is a positive integer, n is an input integer, q is an input integer, a is a list where each element is the accumulated sum of the list up to that index, b is a list of length n + 1 where each element b[i] (for i from 1 to n) is the sum of the previous element b[i-1] and 1 if the corresponding element a[i] is greater than 1 or 2 if a[i] is less than or equal to 1, the loop has executed q times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers x and y from input, then prints 'NO' if a[y] - a[x - 1] is less than b[y] - b[x - 1] or if x equals y, otherwise it prints 'YES'.
