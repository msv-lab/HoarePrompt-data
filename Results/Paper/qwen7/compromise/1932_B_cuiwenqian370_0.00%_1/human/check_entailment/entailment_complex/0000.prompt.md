Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

The first element of `dp` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -inf if the first character of `path` is '*', or 0 otherwise. The second element of `dp` is -inf if the second character of `path` is '*', 1 if the second character of `path` is '@', or `dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)` if the second character is neither '@' nor '*'.
    #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` elements. The first element of `dp` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -inf if the first character of `path` is '*', or 0 otherwise. For each subsequent element `dp[i]` (where `i > 0`), it is -inf if the `(i+1)`-th character of `path` is '*', 1 if the `(i+1)`-th character of `path` is '@', or `dp[i-1] + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)` if the `(i+1)`-th character is neither '@' nor '*'.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':

    #State: dp is a list where each element dp[i] (for i > 1) is calculated based on the characters in the string 'path'. If the (i+1)-th character is '*', dp[i] is set to -inf. If the (i+1)-th character is '@', dp[i] is set to 1. Otherwise, dp[i] is the maximum of dp[i-1] and dp[i-2] plus 1 if the (i+1)-th character is '@', or 0 otherwise. The first element of dp is 1 if the first character of path is '@', -inf if the first character of path is '*', or 0 otherwise.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `path` consisting of '@' and '*' characters and returns either 0 or the maximum value in the list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. If the string `path` is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a dynamic programming list `dp` where each element depends on the characters in `path`. The final result is the maximum valid value in `dp`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of signs for each test case, and path is a string containing n space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])

    results = []

        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: Output State: `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs for each test case, `index` is equal to `t + 2`, `results` is a list containing the outputs of `func_1(path)` for each test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs for each test case, `index` is equal to `t + 2`, `results` is a list containing the outputs of `func_1(path)` for each test case, the loop has executed all iterations, and `result` contains the last printed value from `func_1(path)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of signs and their periodicities from the input, calls another function `func_1` to compute some result based on these periodicities, and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the computed results for each test case.
