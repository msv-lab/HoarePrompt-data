Reasoning:
1. The problem description requires us to find the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially.
2. The provided solution consists of two functions:
   - `func_1`: This function seems to be incorrectly designed for the problem. It appears to be handling a string of '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the problem's requirement of finding the year when signs occur.
   - `func_2`: This function correctly processes the input for multiple test cases, reads the number of signs and their periodicities, and calls `func_1` with these periodicities.
3. However, `func_1` is not solving the problem as intended. The problem requires finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities to determine when all signs will occur in sequence. The current implementation of `func_1` does not perform any such calculation.
4. Given the mismatch between the intended problem and the implementation of `func_1`, the overall program is not solving the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
