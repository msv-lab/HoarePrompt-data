Reasoning:
The annotated program does not match the problem description and the expected behavior. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not solve the problem of determining the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur according to the given periodicities. Instead, `func_1` seems to be designed to process a string of characters ('@' and '*') which is unrelated to the problem context.

Given the problem description, we should expect a function that processes the periodicities of the signs to calculate the year when all signs will occur sequentially. However, the provided functions do not perform this calculation. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
