### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining the year when all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function takes a string `path` consisting of `@` and `*` characters.
     - It calculates a sequence `dp` based on these characters, but this calculation is unrelated to finding the LCM of periodicities.
     - The function returns the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than negative infinity, which is irrelevant to the problem.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - Reads input from standard input and processes it.
     - Calls `func_1` with a string that does not contain the periodicities of the signs but rather some kind of sequence of characters.
     - The function does not correctly calculate the LCM of the periodicities.

3. **Expected Solution**:
   - The solution should involve calculating the LCM of the periodicities for each test case.
   - The LCM can be calculated iteratively using the formula `lcm(a, b) = abs(a*b) // gcd(a, b)` where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor.
   - For multiple periodicities, the LCM can be computed iteratively by applying the formula to pairs of numbers.

4. **Provided Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to find the LCM of the periodicities.
   - The `func_1` function is completely unrelated to the problem and does not perform any meaningful computation related to the LCM.
   - The `func_2` function calls `func_1` with incorrect input, further indicating that the overall approach is flawed.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described, it is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem of finding the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are unrelated to the required logic and do not perform the necessary calculations to determine the LCM of the periodicities.
