Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, `n` is the length of `path`, and `dp` is a list of `n` elements. The first element of `dp` is 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', -inf if the first character of `path` is '*', or 0 otherwise. The second element of `dp` is -inf if the second character of `path` is '*', 1 if the second character of `path` is '@', or `dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)` if the second character is neither '@' nor '*'.
