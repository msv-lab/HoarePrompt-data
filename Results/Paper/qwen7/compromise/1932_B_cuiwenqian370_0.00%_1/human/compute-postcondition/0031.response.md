Output State: **dp is a list where each element dp[i] (for i > 1) is calculated based on the characters in the string 'path'. If the (i+1)-th character is '*', dp[i] is set to -inf. If the (i+1)-th character is '@', dp[i] is set to 1. Otherwise, dp[i] is the maximum of dp[i-1] and dp[i-2] plus 1 if the (i+1)-th character is '@', or 0 otherwise. The first element of dp is 1 if the first character of path is '@', -inf if the first character of path is '*', or 0 otherwise.**
