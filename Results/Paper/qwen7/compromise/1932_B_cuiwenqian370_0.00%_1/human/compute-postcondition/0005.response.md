State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs for each test case, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0**

### Explanation:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and the loop control variable `t`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is initialized to `int(data[0])`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`data`, `n`, `index`, and `results`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop will execute or not, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.
