You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of signs for each test case, and path is a string containing n space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: Output State: `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs for each test case, `index` is equal to `t + 2`, `results` is a list containing the outputs of `func_1(path)` for each test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `n` is an integer representing the number of signs for each test case, `index` is equal to `t + 2`, `results` is a list containing the outputs of `func_1(path)` for each test case, the loop has executed all iterations, and `result` contains the last printed value from `func_1(path)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the number of signs for each test case), and `path` (a string containing `n` space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case). It returns different outputs based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
