Based on the initial state provided:

- `bets` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `t` is 0.
- `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their GCD when taken pairwise.
- `i` is the length of list `l`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.
- `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in list `a`.
- `sumo` is the sum of `a[i-1]` for each iteration of the loop from `i=1` to `i=bets`.

The print statement is simply printing `-1`. Since there are no variables or objects being evaluated or modified within the print statement itself, the value printed will be `-1`.

Output: **-1**
