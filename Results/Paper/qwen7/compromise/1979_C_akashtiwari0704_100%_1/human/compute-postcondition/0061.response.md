Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `bets`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 0.
   - `bets` is a value entered by input.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < bets`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, it will increment with each iteration of the loop.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `bets`. Therefore, `bets` must be greater than 0.

5. **List the necessary adjustments**:
   - `bets` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is already set to 0, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Given the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`bets` must be greater than 0**
