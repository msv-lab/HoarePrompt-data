Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(l) - 1`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < len(l)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
   - `len(l)` must be at least 8.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `len(l)`. Given that `len(l)` is at least 8, `i` must be less than `len(l)`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `g` remains unchanged because the update happens inside the loop body.
   - `len(l)` remains unchanged because it is a property of the list `l` and does not change within the loop.
   - `i` increases by 1 from its previous value.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and ensure that the loop condition is still satisfied.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `len(l)` must be at least 8, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can represent it as `i + 1` to indicate the next value of `i` after the current iteration.
