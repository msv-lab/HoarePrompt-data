Output State: `ans` is "11 11 11 ", `i` is 8, `bets` is 5, `sumo` is 33.

Explanation: The loop runs for the number of times specified by `bets`, which is 5. During each iteration, the value of `a[i]` (which is 11) is converted to a string and appended to `ans` followed by a space. After 3 iterations, `i` is incremented by 3 (from 5 to 8), and since the loop runs 5 times in total, `i` will be 10 after the final iteration. However, the question asks for the state after all iterations, so we consider the final value of `i` as 10. The values of `sumo` and `bets` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
