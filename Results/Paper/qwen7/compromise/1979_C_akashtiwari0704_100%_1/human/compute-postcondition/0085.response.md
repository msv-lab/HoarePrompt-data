Postcondition: **`sumo` is 33, `a[i]` is `prod // 20`, `i` is 8, `bets` is 5, and `ans` is "11 11 11 11 11"**.

This means that after executing the if-else block, `sumo` remains at 33, `a[i]` is still `prod // 20`, `i` is updated to 8, `bets` remains 5, and `ans` is a string containing "11 11 11 11 11".
