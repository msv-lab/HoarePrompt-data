Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is 'a[0]a[1] ', `bets` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the variable `ans` by appending the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is currently 1) followed by a space. Given that `i` was initially 1, after the operation `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `ans` is updated to `'a[0]' + 'a[1]' + ' '`, resulting in `'a[0]a[1] '`. The condition that `bets` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
