Output State: `i` is `bets * 2 - 2`; `ans` is the concatenation of all elements in list `a` separated by spaces.

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `bets * 2 - 2` because the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration and runs `bets` times. The variable `ans` will contain a string that is the concatenation of all elements in the list `a`, separated by spaces, as each element `a[i]` is appended to `ans` in each iteration of the loop.
