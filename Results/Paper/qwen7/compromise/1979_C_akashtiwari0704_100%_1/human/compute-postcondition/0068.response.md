Output State: **`sumo` is 20, `a[i]` is `prod // 20`, `i` is 3, `bets` is 5**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the integer division of `prod` by `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` was initially 20, the new value of `a[i]` will be `prod // 20`. The other variables (`sumo`, `i`, and `bets`) remain unchanged.
