Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `g` is the product of all elements in list `l` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) when taken pairwise, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the length of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `bets = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `bets`. The other variables (`t`, `g`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
