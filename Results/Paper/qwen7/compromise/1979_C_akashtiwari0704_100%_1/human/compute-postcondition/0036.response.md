Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans` is 'a[0] '**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` to `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[i]` refers to `a[0]`. Since no specific value for `a[0]` is given, we represent it as `a[0]` in the string. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The variable `bets` is not affected by this code snippet.
