Output State: `sumo` is 33, `a[i]` is `prod // 20`, `i` is 5, `bets` is 5.

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `sumo` has been incremented by the integer value of `a[i]` for each iteration, resulting in a final value of 33. The loop ran 5 times (`bets` is 5), and on the last iteration, `a[i]` was updated to `prod // 20`. The variable `i` is now 5, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations.
