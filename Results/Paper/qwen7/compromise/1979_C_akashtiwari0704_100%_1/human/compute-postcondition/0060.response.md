Output State: **`sumo` is 0, `bets` is a value entered by input, `t` is 0, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all integers in list `a`, `sumo` remains unchanged, `T` remains unchanged, and `l` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code sets `sumo` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
