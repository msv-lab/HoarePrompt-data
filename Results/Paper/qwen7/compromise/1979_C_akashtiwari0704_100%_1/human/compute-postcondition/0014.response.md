Functionality: The function `lcm` accepts a list `l` where each element is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4. It calculates and returns the product of all elements in the list `l`, divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each pair of elements as they are multiplied together. After the function executes, the variable `g` contains this calculated value, while `t` remains 0 and `l` remains unchanged.
