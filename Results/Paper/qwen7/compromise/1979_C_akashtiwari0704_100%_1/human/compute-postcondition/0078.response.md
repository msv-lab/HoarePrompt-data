Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(bets)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop increments `i` from 0 to `bets-1`. After each iteration, `i` remains unchanged until the next iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the current value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.
   - `i` is unchanged from the previous iteration.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - `bets` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `ans` remains the same as it is dependent on the value of `a[i]`, which changes with each iteration but is not directly modified in the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `bets` remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is the current value of `ans` plus the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space, `i` is incremented by 1, `bets` must be the same**
