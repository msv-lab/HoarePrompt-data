Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `len(l)`.
2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(l)`.
3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`
   - `len(l)` must be at least 8

4. **Analyze the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1 (assuming it was within the bounds of `len(l)`).
   - Therefore, `i` will now be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(l)`. Since `len(l)` remains unchanged, `i` must be less than `len(l)`.

Given that `len(l)` must be at least 8, and assuming `i` was within the valid range for the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was `7` (the maximum value before the next iteration).

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `8` (since it was incremented from `7`).
- `len(l)` remains the same and must still be at least 8.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `g` is updated to `g * l[7] // gcd(g, l[7])`, `len(l)` must be at least 8, `i` is 8**
