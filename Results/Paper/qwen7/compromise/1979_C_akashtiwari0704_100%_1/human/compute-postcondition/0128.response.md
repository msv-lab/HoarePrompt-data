Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `bets + 10`
- `bets` must be greater than or equal to 10
- `ans` contains the string representations of all elements in the list `a` from index 8 to `bets-1`, each followed by a space

We need to determine what will be printed when `print(ans)` is executed.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is set to `bets + 10`.
   - Since `bets` is at least 10, `i` will be at least 20.

2. **Value of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is constructed by concatenating the string representations of all elements in the list `a` from index 8 to `bets-1`, each followed by a space.
   - This means if `bets` is 10, `ans` would be the string representation of `a[8]` followed by a space.
   - If `bets` is 11, `ans` would be the string representation of `a[8]` and `a[9]`, each followed by a space.
   - Generally, `ans` will contain the string representations of elements from `a[8]` to `a[bets-1]`, separated by spaces.

### Final Output:

Given the above, the `print(ans)` statement will output the string representations of the elements in the list `a` from index 8 to `bets-1`, each followed by a space.

Output: **"string(a[8]) string(a[9]) ... string(a[bets-1])" (where "string(x)" represents the string representation of element x in the list a, and bets is the value of bets, which must be greater than or equal to 10)**
