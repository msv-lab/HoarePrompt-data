Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the length `n` of the array and then reads `n` integers into the list `a`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(c)` is defined but never called with the actual length of the array `n`. This function is not used in the main logic of the program.

3. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - The program checks if the length of the array `c` is 2 and prints a specific output for this case.
   - For all other lengths, it prints a different output.

4. **Problem-Specific Logic:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum sum of the array by performing operations to set subarrays to their MEX values.
   - The given solution does not implement any logic to find the MEX value or perform the operations to maximize the sum.

### Correctness Check:

- **Case 1: Array Length 2**
  - Given input: `0 1`
  - Expected output: `4 1` followed by `1 2`
  - Actual output: `4 1` followed by `1 2`
  - This part seems correct for the specific test case provided.

- **Case 2: Array Length 3**
  - Given input: `1 3 9`
  - Expected output: `13 0`
  - Actual output: `13 0`
  - This part is also correct for the specific test case provided.

- **Case 3: Array Length 4**
  - Given input: `1 100 2 1`
  - Expected output: `105 2` followed by `3 3` and `3 4`
  - Actual output: `105 2` followed by `3 3` and `3 4`
  - This part is correct for the specific test case provided.

- **General Case:**
  - The program does not handle general cases where the array length is greater than 2 or less than 2.
  - It does not implement the logic to find the MEX value or perform the required operations to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for general cases. It only handles specific test cases (lengths 2, 3, and 4) and does not provide a general solution. Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: **False**
