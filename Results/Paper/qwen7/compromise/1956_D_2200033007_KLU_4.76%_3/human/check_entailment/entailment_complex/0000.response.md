Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in the array using up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations, where each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
2. The provided code does not actually implement the logic to find the MEX for any subarray or perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. Instead, it has hardcoded outputs based on the length of the array.
3. For arrays of length 2, the code correctly identifies that the maximum sum is 4 by setting both elements to 2 (the MEX of \{0, 1\} is 2).
4. For arrays of other lengths, the code incorrectly hardcodes the output as 13 0, which is not necessarily the correct maximum sum for those cases. For example, an array like [1, 100, 2, 1] would have a maximum sum of 105 by setting all elements to 0, but the code does not reflect this.
5. The code does not handle the actual computation of MEX values or the application of operations to the array, which are essential parts of solving the problem.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
