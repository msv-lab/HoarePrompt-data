Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Function Summary Analysis**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `c` and checks if its length is 2. If it is, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2". Otherwise, it prints "13 0". This behavior is consistent with the provided function summary.

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The program reads the input length `n` and then reads the array `a`.
   - However, the actual logic to process the array `a` and perform the operations to maximize the sum is missing.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `a`, but it does not use the array `a` at all.
   - The hardcoded outputs "4 1" and "13 0" do not depend on the actual content of the array `a`.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 2` and array `[0, 1]`, the program outputs "4 1" and "1 2", which is correct for this specific case.
   - For `n = 3` and array `[1, 3, 9]`, the program outputs "13 0", which is also correct for this specific case.
   - For `n = 4` and array `[1, 100, 2, 1]`, the program outputs "105 2" and performs the operations "3 3" and "3 4", which is correct for this specific case.
   - For `n = 1` and array `[0]`, the program outputs "1 1", which is correct for this specific case.

However, these outputs are hardcoded and do not reflect the general logic required to solve the problem. The program does not dynamically calculate the MEX value or perform the operations needed to maximize the sum of the array elements. Therefore, the program will not work for other inputs unless they match the hardcoded cases.

Final: **False**
