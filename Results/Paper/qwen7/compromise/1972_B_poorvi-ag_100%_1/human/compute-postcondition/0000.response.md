Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**.

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. The variables `n` and `s` are not affected by this code snippet, so they retain their initial state description.
