Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Evaluate `h`:**
   - Since `n` is 0, let's substitute `n` into the formula for `h`:
     \[
     h = n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1
     \]
   - Substituting `n = 0`:
     \[
     h = 0 // (0 - k + 1) + 0 // 1
     \]
   - The expression `0 // (0 - k + 1)` involves division by zero if `k` is 1, which is undefined. However, since `h` is defined to be greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` must be an integer, let's assume `k` is such that the expression is valid (e.g., `k > 1`).

3. **Simplified Expression:**
   - For `k > 1`, `0 // (0 - k + 1)` is 0 because any non-zero number subtracted from 0 results in a negative number, and integer division of 0 by a negative number is 0.
   - `0 // 1` is also 0.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     h = 0 + 0 = 0
     \]

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(2)`.
   - This directly prints the integer 2.

Given the above steps, the print statement will output the integer 2.

Output: **2**
