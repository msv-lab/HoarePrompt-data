Output: **YES**

Explanation: According to the initial state, both `n` and `k` are positive integers with the same value, and this value is within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\). The print statement simply outputs the string 'YES', which does not depend on the values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the output will be 'YES'.
