Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - Since `n` is 0, let's evaluate the expression for `h`:
     - `n // (n - k + 1)`: This expression involves division and floor division. When `n` is 0, the denominator `n - k + 1` becomes `-k + 1`. If `k` is positive, this expression results in a division by a negative number, leading to a large negative integer due to floor division.
     - `n // 1`: Since `n` is 0, `0 // 1` is 0.
   - Therefore, `h` is the sum of a large negative integer and 0, which is still a large negative integer.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `h >= k` must hold true. Given that `h` is a large negative integer, for the condition to be true, `k` must also be a large negative integer or zero. However, since `h` is explicitly stated to be greater than or equal to `k`, we can conclude that `k` must be a large negative integer such that the inequality holds.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will simply output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
