Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`; `k` is a positive integer; `costs` is a list containing two elements, the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`.**

This means that the initial conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and a new list `costs` has been created with the first element being `n - k + 1` and the second element being `1`.
