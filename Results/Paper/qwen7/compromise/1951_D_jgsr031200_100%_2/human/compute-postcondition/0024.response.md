Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers between 1 and \(10^{18}\). It checks if `n` is equal to `k`, in which case it prints "YES" followed by three 1s and returns `n`. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" and returns `None`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of divisions of `n` by elements in the list `[n - k + 1, 1]` and stores it in `h`. If `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, and the list `[n - k + 1, 1]`. The function ultimately returns `n` if the conditions are met or `None` otherwise.**
