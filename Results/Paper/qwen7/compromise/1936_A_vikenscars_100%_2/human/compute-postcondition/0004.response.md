Output State: **`pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `max_item_idx` to `pair_idx`. The value of `max_item_idx` remains unchanged, and `pair_idx` now holds the same value. All other information from the initial state, including the definition of `max_item_idx`, is still valid.
