State: **`pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
- `pair_idx` being equal to `max_item_idx` is not directly related to the loop's execution condition.
- The loop will start executing if `n` is greater than 0.
- Initially, `i` should be set to 0 as it is the starting index for the `range(n)` function.

Therefore, the relevant states to adjust are `i` to 0 and `n` to be greater than 0.
