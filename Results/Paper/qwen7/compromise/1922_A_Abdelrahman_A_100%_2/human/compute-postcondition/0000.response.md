Output State: **`tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `tests` ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, the same condition applies to `tests` after the code execution. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
