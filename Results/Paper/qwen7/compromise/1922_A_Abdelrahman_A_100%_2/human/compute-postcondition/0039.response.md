Based on the initial state provided:

- `no` is `True`
- `tests` is greater than `0` and `i` is `0`
- `a` is an input string
- `b` is an input string from the user
- `c` is an input string, and its current value is either equal to `a` or `b`

The loop will execute until `no` becomes `False`. However, the loop's conditions and the changes within it do not affect the `print('NO')` statement directly. The loop's behavior ensures that `no` remains `True` after the loop, but this does not change the fact that the `print('NO')` statement will execute immediately after the loop.

Therefore, the `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string "NO".

Output: **NO**
