Postcondition: `counter` is 3, `a` is the input string from the user, `no` is False, `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the next character in the string `c`, `b` is the new input string from the user, and if `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
