Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is the input string from the user.
- `no` is `False`.
- `tests` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `2`.
- `c` is a non-empty string.
- `x` is the last character in the string `c`.
- The counter is `0`.
- `b` is the new input string from the user.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables because it is a direct print of a string literal.

Output: **YES**
