Postcondition: `no`'s value depends on whether `c` matches `a` or `b` during the loop's execution, `tests` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` is the input string from the user, `x` is the last character in the string `c`, the counter is equal to the length of `c` + 1, and `b` retains its original input value from the user.
