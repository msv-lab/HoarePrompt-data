Output State: **`no` is True, `tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0; `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from user, `c` is an input string**.

Explanation: The line `no = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `no`. The values of `tests`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
