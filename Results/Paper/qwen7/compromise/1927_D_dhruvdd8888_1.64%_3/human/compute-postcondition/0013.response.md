Based on the initial state provided:

- `LA` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
- `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
- `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
- Each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
- `nums` is a list of integers with its last element being -1.
- `s` is equal to `N`.
- `e` is 0.
- `num` is the last element of `nums`, which is -1.
- `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: the first element is an integer starting from 1 plus the value of `s`, the second element is an integer `i` ranging from 0 to `N`, and the third element is the integer `num` which is consistent throughout each tuple. The value of `ppp` is 23.

The `print(nums)` statement will print the list `nums`. Given that `nums` is explicitly described as a list of integers ending with -1, and no other specific values are provided for the elements of `nums`, the list will be printed as is.

Output: **[-1]**
