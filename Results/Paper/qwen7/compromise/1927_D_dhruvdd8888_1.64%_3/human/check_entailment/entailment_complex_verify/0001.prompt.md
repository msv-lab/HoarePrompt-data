You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

For each query (l, r), the output could be one of the following: (-1, -1), (s, e+1) where s and e are determined based on the binary search result. Since the exact inputs are not given, the output cannot be precisely calculated. However, it will consist of multiple lines, each containing either two numbers or two -1s, corresponding to the results of each query.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `nums` and handles a series of queries defined by pairs of indices `l` and `r`. For each query, it determines a subarray within `nums` and outputs either the start and end indices of a segment within this subarray or (-1, -1) if no valid segment is found. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads:
     - The size of the array `N`.
     - The array `nums` of length `N`.
     - The number of queries `q`.
     - Each query consists of `l` and `r`.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The function `func_1()` processes the array to identify segments where consecutive elements are the same.
   - It creates a list `arr` where each element is a tuple `(start, end, value)` representing a segment of the array where the value is constant.
   - The last element of `arr` is added as a sentinel value `(-1)` to handle edge cases.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment in `arr`.
   - It checks if the start of the segment is within the query range `[l, r]`.
   - Depending on the position of the end of the segment relative to the query range, it prints the appropriate indices or `-1 -1`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Array Segmentation:**
   - The segmentation logic correctly identifies segments of the array where consecutive elements are the same.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the way segments are defined. The current implementation might miss some segments if there are multiple consecutive identical elements.

2. **Binary Search Usage:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` to find the relevant segment is correct.
   - The logic to handle the segment positions and print the results is mostly correct but could be simplified.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when the start of the segment is greater than `l` and when the end of the segment is less than `r`.
   - The handling of the sentinel value `(-1)` seems unnecessary and might cause issues if not handled carefully.

### Correctness Check

Given the example provided, let's verify the program against a few test cases:

#### Test Case 1:
- **Input:**
  ```
  5
  5
  1 1 2 1 1
  3
  1 5
  1 2
  1 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2 3
  -1 -1
  1 3
  ```

#### Test Case 2:
- **Input:**
  ```
  6
  30 20 20 10 10 20
  5
  1 2
  2 3
  2 4
  2 6
  3 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2 1
  -1 -1
  4 2
  4 6
  5 3
  ```

After running the program with these test cases, the output matches the expected results. Therefore, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and the provided test cases, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

**Correctness: **True**
