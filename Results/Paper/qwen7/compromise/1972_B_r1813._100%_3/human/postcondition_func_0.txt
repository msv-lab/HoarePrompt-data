The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 100), and for each test case, a positive integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting of "U" and "D". It checks if the count of "U" characters in \( s \) is odd and prints "YES" if true, otherwise "NO". The function outputs the result for each test case, totaling \( t \) lines of output.
