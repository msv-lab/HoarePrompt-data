Reasoning:
1. The annotated program reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
2. The program correctly extracts the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it correctly extracts the number of coins (`n`) and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
4. The program counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
5. The logic to determine the winner is based on whether the count of 'U' characters is odd or even. This logic is correct according to the problem statement:
   - If the count of 'U' characters is odd, Alice wins because she can always make a move that leaves an odd number of 'U' characters for Bob.
   - If the count of 'U' characters is even, Bob wins because he can always respond to Alice's moves in such a way that keeps the count of 'U' characters even until the end.
6. The program prints "YES" if Alice wins and "NO" if Bob wins, which matches the required output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution states.

Correctness: **True**
