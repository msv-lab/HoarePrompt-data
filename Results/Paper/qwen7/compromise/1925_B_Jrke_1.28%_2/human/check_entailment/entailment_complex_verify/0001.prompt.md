You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will hold the maximum value among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the initial value of `k` (which is `x // n`), and possibly their corresponding quotient when divided into `x`. The variable `i` will be the largest odd integer less than or equal to the square root of `x` after all iterations. The list `l` will contain the maximum divisor found (`ans`), and any other divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k` and satisfy the condition `x % i == 0`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `ans` will be the greatest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`, and `i` will be the largest odd number less than or equal to the square root of `x`. The list `l` will include `ans` and any other relevant divisors of `x` that meet the specified conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving three integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( x // n \), and prints this value. If no such divisor exists, it prints 1. Additionally, it finds the largest odd integer less than or equal to the square root of \( x \) and uses it to determine relevant divisors.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which gives the minimum difficulty per sub-problem if they were evenly distributed.
   - If `k` equals 1, it directly prints `1` because the GCD of any set of numbers where each number is 1 is 1. This handles the simplest case correctly.

3. **Finding Maximum Balance**:
   - The program then attempts to find the maximum possible GCD (balance) by iterating over potential divisors of `x`.
   - It starts from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)` and goes up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` with a step of 2, ensuring only odd numbers are considered.
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`, it checks if both `i` and `x // i` are less than or equal to `k`. If so, it updates the answer (`ans`) with the maximum value among the current `ans` and the new candidates.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case when `k` is 1 by printing `1`.
   - It also ensures that the sub-problems' difficulties do not exceed `k` by checking against `k`.

### Verification of Logic

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The logic of finding the maximum GCD by iterating over divisors is sound. The GCD of a set of numbers is indeed the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently limits the search space to divisors up to `sqrt(x)` and only considers odd numbers, reducing unnecessary computations.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The program correctly handles the boundary condition when `k` is 1.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can conclude that it correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the sub-problems. The program handles all given constraints and examples accurately.
