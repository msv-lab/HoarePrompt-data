Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, 5, and `x // 5`, `i` is 5, `x` is an integer, `l` is a list containing `[ans, 5]`, and `l.append(i)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 5) to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains `[ans]`. After executing `l.append(i)`, `l` becomes `[ans, 5]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
