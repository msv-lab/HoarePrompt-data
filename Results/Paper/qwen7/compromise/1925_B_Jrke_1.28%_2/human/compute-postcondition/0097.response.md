Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an input integer from the split input.
- `n` is an input integer from the split input.
- `i` is the largest odd integer less than or equal to the square root of the original `x`.
- `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` (maximum divisor found for the new `x`), `i`, and potentially `x // i` if `x % i == 0`.
- `k` is `x // n`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement will directly print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
