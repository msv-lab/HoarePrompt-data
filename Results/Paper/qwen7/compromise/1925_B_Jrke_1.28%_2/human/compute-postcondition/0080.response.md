Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `x` is an input integer.
- `i` is 3 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 4.
- `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` (which is the maximum value between `ans` and `i`), `i`, and if `x % i == 0`, then `x // i` is appended to the list `l` and `i` remains less than `int(x)`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Range Calculation**:
   - The starting value of `i` is `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`.
     - If `x` is even, the starting value is `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - If `x` is odd, the starting value is `1 + 0 = 1`.
   - The ending value of `i` is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - The step value is `2`.

3. **Current Value of `i`**:
   - From the initial state, `i` is either 3 (if `x` is odd) or 4 (if `x` is even).

4. **Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since the step is `2`, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2`.
   - If `x` is odd, `i` starts from 3, so the next value is `3 + 2 = 5`.
   - If `x` is even, `i` starts from 4, so the next value is `4 + 2 = 6`.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

### Adjusted States for the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be the next value in the sequence, which is `5` if `x` is odd and `6` if `x` is even.
- The other variables (`x`, `l`, `ans`) remain unchanged unless they are modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, these values stay the same.

### Final Answer:
State: **`x` is an input integer, `i` is 5 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 6, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` (which is the maximum value between `ans` and `i`), `i`, and if `x % i == 0`, then `x // i` is appended to the list `l` and `i` remains less than `int(x)`**.
