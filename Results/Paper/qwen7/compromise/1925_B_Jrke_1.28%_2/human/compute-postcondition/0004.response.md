Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an integer input from the first split.
- `n` is an integer input from the second split.
- `k` is the floor division result of `x` by `n`, and it is explicitly stated that `k` is 1.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(1)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
