Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `ans` will hold the maximum value among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, and possibly their corresponding quotient when divided into `x`.**

Explanation: The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. The initial state of `ans` (which was defined to hold the maximum value among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, and possibly their corresponding quotient when divided into `x`) remains unchanged because no operation has been performed on `ans` yet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `x` and `n`, along with the unchanged description of `ans`.
