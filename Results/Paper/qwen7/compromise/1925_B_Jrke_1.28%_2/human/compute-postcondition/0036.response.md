Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, `l` is a list containing ['ans', `i`], where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains the element 'ans', which is the maximum value among the elements in `l`. After appending `i`, `l` now contains both 'ans' and `i`. Since `i` is a divisor of `x`, it could potentially be the new maximum value if `i` is greater than the current `ans`. However, without knowing the exact value of `i`, we can only say that `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`, which now includes `i`.
