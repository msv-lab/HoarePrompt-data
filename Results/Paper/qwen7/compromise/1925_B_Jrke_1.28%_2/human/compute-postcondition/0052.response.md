Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` holds the maximum value among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, and possibly their corresponding quotient when divided into `x`. Since the else part is not present, the condition `k == 1` directly determines the value of `ans`.**
