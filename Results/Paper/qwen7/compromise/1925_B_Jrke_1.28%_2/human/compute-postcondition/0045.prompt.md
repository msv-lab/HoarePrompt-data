Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 1, `x` is an integer input from the first split, `n` is an integer input from the second split, and `k` is the floor division result of `x` by `n`. If `k` equals 1, we continue the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `l` is a list. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains three elements ['ans', `i`, `x // i`], where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`. If `i` is greater than `k`, then `l` remains as ['ans'], where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `l` is a list. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains three elements `['ans', i, x // i]`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`. If `i` is greater than `k`, then `l` remains as `['ans']`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`. Here, `ans` represents the maximum value found in the list `l` after considering the current value of `i` and the integer division of `x` by `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `l` is a list. If `i + 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains three elements `['ans', i + 2, x // (i + 2)]`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`. If `i + 2` is greater than `k`, then `l` remains as `['ans']`, where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
