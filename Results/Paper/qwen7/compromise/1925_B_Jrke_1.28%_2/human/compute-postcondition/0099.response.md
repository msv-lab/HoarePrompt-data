Postcondition: **`x` is now an input integer from the split input, `n` is an input integer from the split input, `i` is the largest odd integer less than or equal to the square root of the original `x`, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` (maximum divisor found for the new `x`), `i`, and potentially `x // i` if `x % i == 0`, `k` is `x // n`. If `k == 1`, then the function continues with the current state of the variables.**
