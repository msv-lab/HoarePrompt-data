The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, and the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a loop, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x` is now an input integer from the split input, `n` is an input integer from the split input, `i` is the largest odd integer less than or equal to the square root of the original `x`, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` (maximum divisor found for the new `x`), `i`, and potentially `x // i` if `x % i == 0`, `k` is `x // n`.**
