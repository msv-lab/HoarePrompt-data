Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is 1**.

The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `ans`. Since the initial value of `ans` was determined by the maximum value among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, and now `ans` is explicitly set to `1`, the value of `ans` is updated to `1`. The other variables (`x`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
