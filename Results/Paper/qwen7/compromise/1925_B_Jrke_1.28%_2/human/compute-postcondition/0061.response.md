Postcondition: `x` is an input integer, `i` is 1 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `i`, and the current value of `x` satisfies `x % i == 0`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `i` remains the same and `l` contains `ans` and `i`. If `i` is greater than `k`, then no changes are made to `x`, `i`, and `l`. Additionally, `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.
