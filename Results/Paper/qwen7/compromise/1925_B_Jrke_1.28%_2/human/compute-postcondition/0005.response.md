Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the first split, `n` is an integer input from the second split, `k` is the floor division result of `x` by `n` and its value is 1, we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply moves the control flow to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the loop continues.
