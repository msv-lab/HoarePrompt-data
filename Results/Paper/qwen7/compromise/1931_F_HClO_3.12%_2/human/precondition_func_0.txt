t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n⋅k ≤ 2⋅10^5. Each test case consists of k lines, where the i-th line contains n integers representing the order of participants seen by the i-th user who posted a screenshot. All integers in each line are unique and within the range [1, n]. The sum of n⋅k across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
