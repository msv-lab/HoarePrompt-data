The only object in the loop head is `_` and `m`, but since `_` is just a placeholder variable, it does not affect the loop's execution. The loop's continuation depends on the value of `m`. At the end of the previous iteration, the function `input()` was called and waits for user input, meaning `m` has not yet been determined.

For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 1 (since `range(m - 2)` implies `m - 2 > 0` or `m > 2`).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `m` is greater than 2.

State: **`input()` is called and waits for user input, `m` must be greater than 2**
