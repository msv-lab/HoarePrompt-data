Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` remains `i + 1` and `idx2` becomes `i`, and the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` becomes `i` and `idx2` becomes `i`. Otherwise, `idx1` remains `i + 1` and `idx2` becomes `i`, and the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
