Output State: **`idx1` is `i + 1`, `idx2` is `i`, `p2` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `p2 = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `p2`. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition `if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not directly affected by this assignment, so the precondition about breaking out of the loop or if statement remains as it was.
