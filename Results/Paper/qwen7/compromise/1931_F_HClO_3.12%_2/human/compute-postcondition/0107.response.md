Based on the initial state provided:

- `idx1` is either -1 or 0.
- `idx2` is either -1 or 0.
- `p1` is either 0 or 1.
- `p2` is either 0 or 1.
- `val` is an empty list.
- `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, with `idx1` not being strictly greater than `idx2`.

This means that `idx1` and `idx2` must both be -1 or both be 0, since they cannot be different from each other and `idx1` cannot be strictly greater than `idx2`.

The `print('yes')` statement will simply print the string 'yes'.

Output: **yes**
