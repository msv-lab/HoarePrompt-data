Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. This means `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is that `m` must be greater than or equal to 3. This means `m >= 3`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m - 2` must still be greater than 0. Therefore, `m` must be greater than 2. Since the current state already indicates `m >= 3`, it satisfies the condition for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the State**: We need to adjust the state such that `m` remains greater than or equal to 3, because if `m` were to decrease below 3, the loop would terminate.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should remain the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, which is `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.

**State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
