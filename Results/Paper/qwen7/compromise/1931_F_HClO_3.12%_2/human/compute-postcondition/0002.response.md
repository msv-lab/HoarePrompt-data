Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
