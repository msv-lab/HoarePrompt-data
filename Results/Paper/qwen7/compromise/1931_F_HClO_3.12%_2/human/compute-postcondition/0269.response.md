Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing a tuple (`a3`, `l3`) appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The values of `m`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged. The list `val` now contains one additional element, which is the tuple `(a3, l3)`.
