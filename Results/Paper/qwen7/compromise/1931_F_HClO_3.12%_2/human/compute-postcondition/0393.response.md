Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`. The initial values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain unchanged. The variable `m` is not mentioned in the initial state or the code, so its value does not affect the output state.
