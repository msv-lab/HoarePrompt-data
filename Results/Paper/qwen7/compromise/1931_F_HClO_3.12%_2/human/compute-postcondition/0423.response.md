Postcondition: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is a list containing at least `m-1` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers. If `l3` is not equal to `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
