Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of `a3` and `l3` from each iteration, and `t` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial conditions for `m` and `t` remain unchanged, and the list `val` is not affected by this code. Therefore, `m` is now an input integer, while `t` remains greater than 1, and `val` retains its initial state.
