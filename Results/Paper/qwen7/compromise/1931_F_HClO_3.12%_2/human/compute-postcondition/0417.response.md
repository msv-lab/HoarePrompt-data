Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is a list containing three tuples `[('a3', [l3]), ('a3', l3), (a3, l3)], a1 is an integer, a2 is an integer, a3 is an integer, l3 is a list containing integers, m must be greater than 2**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains two tuples `[('a3', [l3]), ('a3', l3)]`. After appending `(a3, l3)`, `val` now contains three tuples. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2`, `m`, and `l3` remain unchanged.
