Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l` is a reference to `l2`**.

Explanation: The code `l = l2` assigns `l2` to `l`. This does not change the contents of `l2`, but it creates a new reference `l` that points to the same list as `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
