Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 2, `val` must contain at least one tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `a3` and `l3` will be the first tuple from `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to a list containing all elements of `l` excluding `a3`, the postcondition remains as the precondition.
