Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. This means `idx1` and `idx2` are now both equal to `i`. The condition `if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` remains unchanged, so we keep it as part of the output state.
