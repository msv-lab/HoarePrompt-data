Postcondition: `idx1` is either `i` or `i + 1`, `idx2` is either `0` or `i`, and `p1` and `p2` are adjusted accordingly based on the condition of the if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` becomes `i` and `idx2` becomes `0`, with `p1` being set to `1`. Otherwise, `idx1` remains `i + 1`, `idx2` becomes `i`, and `p2` is set to `1`.
