Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes k lines of n unique integers ranging from 1 to n. For each test case, the function determines the order of participants seen by each of the k users. The function returns information about the order of participants for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values (such as specific data structures or formatted strings) are not detailed here as per the given instructions.
