Output State: **`m` is decreased by 1, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, `l3` remain unchanged.**

The code `m -= 1` decrements the value of `m` by 1. However, since the initial state does not specify the value of `m`, we only know that `m` is decreased by 1. All other variables (`idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`) remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
