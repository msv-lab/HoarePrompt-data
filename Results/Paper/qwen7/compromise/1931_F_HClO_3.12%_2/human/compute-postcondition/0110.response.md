Output State: **`idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer input from the user, `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and splits them into two parts. The first part is assigned to `a3` as a single integer, and the rest are assigned to `l3` as a list of integers. The conditions about `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain unchanged.
