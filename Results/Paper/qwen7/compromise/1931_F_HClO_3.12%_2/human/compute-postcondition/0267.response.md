Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variables involved in this loop head are `m` and the placeholder `_` (which is typically used when the loop variable is not needed).

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. This means `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 2.
   - `a3` is the first integer from input.
   - `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input.
   - `val` is a list containing a tuple `(a3, l3)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `m - 2 > 0`, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 3 (because `m - 2` should be greater than 0, so `m` should be at least 4).
   - The values of `a3`, `l3`, and `val` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input, `val` is a list containing a tuple `(a3, l3)`**.
