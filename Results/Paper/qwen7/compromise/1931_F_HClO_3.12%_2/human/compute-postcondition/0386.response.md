Output State: **`idx1` is an integer and greater than `idx2`, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is an empty list, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `idx2`, `l` is `l1`**.

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns the reference of `l1` to the variable `l`. This does not create a new list but rather makes `l` point to the same list that `l1` points to. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, and the insertion of `a1` into `l1` at index `idx2` remain unchanged.
