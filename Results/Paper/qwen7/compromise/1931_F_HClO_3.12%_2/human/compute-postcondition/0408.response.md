Postcondition: `idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is an empty list, and if `idx1` is less than `idx2`, the value `a2` is inserted into the list at index `idx1`, `l` is updated to `l2`. Otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, the value `a1` is inserted into the list at index `idx2`, and `l` is updated to `l1`. If `idx1` is equal to `idx2`, `m` is decreased by 1, and `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.
