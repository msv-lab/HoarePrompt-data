Postcondition: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input during the loop iterations, converted to int, `val` is an empty list before the loop starts. The current state of `l3` is such that it does not contain any elements that are equal to `a3`.**
