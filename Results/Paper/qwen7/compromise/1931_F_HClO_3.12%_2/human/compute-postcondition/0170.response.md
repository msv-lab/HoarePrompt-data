Output State: **The loop will execute `m-2` times in total, and after all iterations, an input is taken but not assigned to any variable, and `m` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since the loop was already set to execute `m-2` times, the `continue` statement does not affect the number of iterations. Additionally, the condition that `m` must be greater than 3 for the loop to run at least 3 times remains unchanged. After the loop completes, an input is taken but not assigned to any variable.
