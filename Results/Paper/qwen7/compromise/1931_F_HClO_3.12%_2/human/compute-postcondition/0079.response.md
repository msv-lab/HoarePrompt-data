Output State: **`idx1` is equal to `idx2`, `idx2` is equal to `i`, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code sets `idx1` and `idx2` both to the value of `i`. The conditions related to `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, and the break condition involving `i`, `max(p1, p2)`, and `n` is not relevant to the current state update.
