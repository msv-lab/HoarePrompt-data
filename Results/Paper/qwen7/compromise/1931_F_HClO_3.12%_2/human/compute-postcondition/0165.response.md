Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The loop variable `_` is an underscore, which typically indicates that the value of the loop variable is not used within the loop. However, the loop itself depends on the value of `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. This means `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to start, and it must remain greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - An input is taken but not assigned to any variable.
   - `m` must be greater than 3.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `m` is greater than 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than 3.
   - The input taken is not relevant to the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **An input is taken but not assigned to any variable, `m` must be greater than 3**
