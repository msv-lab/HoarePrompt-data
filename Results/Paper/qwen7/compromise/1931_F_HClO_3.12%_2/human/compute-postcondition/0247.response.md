Output State: **`idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `val` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, `l22` are set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the loop body, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables before the `continue` statement are the same as after it.
