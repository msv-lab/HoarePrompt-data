Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.**

The code `idx1 = idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. The values of `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged at 0. The condition `if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not evaluated here, only the assignment is performed.
