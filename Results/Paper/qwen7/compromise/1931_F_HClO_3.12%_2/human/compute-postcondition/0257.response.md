Output State: **`idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `val` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, `l22` are set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2` plus 1; `a3` is an integer read from input, `l3` is a list of integers read from input, `l` is equal to `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to the variable `l`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, `l` now holds the same value as `l2`.
