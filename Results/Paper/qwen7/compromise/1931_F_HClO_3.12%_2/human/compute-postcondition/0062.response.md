Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `i` is `k + 1` where `k` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `idx1 = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `idx1`. The values of `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement remains the same: if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
