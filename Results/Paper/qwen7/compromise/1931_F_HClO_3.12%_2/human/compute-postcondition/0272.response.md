Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing a tuple (`a3`, `l3`) appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a tuple containing `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. The values of `m`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged. The list `val` now contains the tuple `(a3, l3)` in addition to its previous elements.
