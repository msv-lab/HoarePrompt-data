Output State: **`idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such block is specified in the given code, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
