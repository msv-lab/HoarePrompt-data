Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is a list containing at least `m-1` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer and `l3` is a list of integers. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply indicates that the program would exit the most internal loop or conditional block it was in. All other variables retain their initial states.
