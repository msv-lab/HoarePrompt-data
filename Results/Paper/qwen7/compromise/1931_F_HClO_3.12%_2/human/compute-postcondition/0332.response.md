Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are integers, `i` is an integer, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, and `i` remains unchanged.
