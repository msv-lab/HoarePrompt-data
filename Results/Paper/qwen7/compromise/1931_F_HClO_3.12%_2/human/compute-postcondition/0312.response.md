Postcondition: **`a1` and `a2` are the first elements of the input split into integers, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, and `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, then the loop will have executed `m-2` times and `m` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `l11` is equal to `l22`, no further action is taken.**
