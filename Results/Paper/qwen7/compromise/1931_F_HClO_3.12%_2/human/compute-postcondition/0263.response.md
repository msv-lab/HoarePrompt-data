Postcondition: **`idx1` and `idx2` are set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations; `val` is either an empty list or a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then `l2` is updated by inserting `a2` at index `idx1`, and `val` remains unchanged. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, then `val` may contain one tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `m` is decreased by 1 if `idx1` is not strictly greater than `idx2`.**
