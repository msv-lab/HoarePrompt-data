Postcondition: `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer input from the user, `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs, if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l3` is equal to `l1`; otherwise, `a2` is inserted at the position `idx1` in `l3`, and `l3` is assigned the value of `l2`.
