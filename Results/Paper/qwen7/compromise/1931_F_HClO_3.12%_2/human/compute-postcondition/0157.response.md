Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from input, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from input.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `a1`. The rest of the integers are collected into a list `l1`. Since the initial values of `n`, `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `t` are not changed by this operation, they remain as stated in the initial state.
