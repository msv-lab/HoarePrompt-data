Output State: **`idx1` is either -1 or 0; `idx2` is either -1 or 0; `p1` is either 0 or 1; `p2` is either 0 or 1; `val` is an empty list; `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `idx2`; `l` is a reference to `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns `l1` to `l`, meaning `l` now references the same list as `l1`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
