Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers containing `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`, `l` references `l3`**.

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns the reference of `l1` (which is `l3`) to the variable `l`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `l` now references the same list as `l3`, which contains `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`.
