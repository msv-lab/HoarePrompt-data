Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial conditions and the fact that no variables are reassigned or modified within the provided code snippet, the only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional structure.
