You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n⋅k ≤ 2⋅10^5. Each test case consists of k lines, where the i-th line contains n integers representing the order of participants seen by the i-th user who posted a screenshot. All integers in each line are unique and within the range [1, n]. The sum of n⋅k across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations without breaking, and the final output printed is 'yes'. All the conditions inside the loop have been satisfied throughout its execution, ensuring that no contradictions arise between the lists `l1` and `l2` after all insertions and checks. The variable `val` contains a list of tuples `(a3, l3)` for each iteration beyond the initial two, and `idx1` and `idx2` are integers indicating the positions where insertions were made, if any. The values of `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, depending on the path taken through the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes k lines of n unique integers ranging from 1 to n. For each test case, the function determines the order of participants seen by each of the k users. The function returns information about the order of participants for each test case.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
