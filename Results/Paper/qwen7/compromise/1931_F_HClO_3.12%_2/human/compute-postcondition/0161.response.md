Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variables involved here are `m` and the loop counter `_`. However, since `_` is just a placeholder and doesn't affect the loop condition, we only need to focus on `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. This means `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute. All other variables (`n`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, `l22`) do not affect the loop's execution condition and can remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m` being greater than 2.

**State:**
**`m` must be greater than 2**
