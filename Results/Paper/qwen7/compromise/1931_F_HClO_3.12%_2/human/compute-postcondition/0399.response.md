Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list of integers, `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code inserts `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
