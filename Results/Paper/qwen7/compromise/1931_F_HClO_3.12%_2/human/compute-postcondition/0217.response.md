Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, and either `(i + 1) + max(p1, p2) = n - 1` or `(i + 1) + max(p1, p2) = n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` is equal to `i` and `idx2` is equal to `i`, then `l1[(i + 1) + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[(i + 1) + p2]` is equal to `a1`. Otherwise, `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, and the conditions involving `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, `l2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged.**
