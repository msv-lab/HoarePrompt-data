Postcondition: `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer input from the user, `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs, if the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `l` is equal to `l1`. Otherwise, the index of `a3` in `l3` is greater than or equal to the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l3` has `a2` inserted at the position `idx1`, and `l` is assigned the value of `l2`.
