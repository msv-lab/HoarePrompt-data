Output State: **`m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing a tuple (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code splits the input into multiple integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The first integer is assigned to `a3`, and the rest are stored in a list `l3`. The tuple `(a3, l3)` is then added to the list `val`. The conditions and values of `m` and the initial state of `val` remain unchanged.
