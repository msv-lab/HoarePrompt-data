Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is an integer converted from the first input, `l3` is a list containing integers converted from the remaining inputs, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `a3` and `l3` are already defined as an integer and a list of integers respectively, the list `val` now contains this single tuple. All other variables remain unchanged.
