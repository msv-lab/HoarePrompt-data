Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1**

The code initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, both to -1. Since these variables did not hold any specific values before the assignment, they are simply set to -1 after the code execution. All other variables (`a1`, `l11`, `n`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
