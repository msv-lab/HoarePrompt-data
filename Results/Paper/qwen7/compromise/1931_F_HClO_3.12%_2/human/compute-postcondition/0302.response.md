Output State: **`a1` is the first element of the input split into integers, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `a2` is the first element of the input split into integers, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` that contains only the elements of `l2` that are not equal to `a1`. The values of `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
