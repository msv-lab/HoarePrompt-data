Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is a list containing two tuples `[('a3', [l3]), (a3, l3)]`, `a1` is an integer, `a2` is an integer, `a3` is an integer, `l3` is a list containing integers.**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple `(a3, l3)`. After appending, `val` now contains two tuples: the original tuple and the newly appended tuple. All other variables remain unchanged.
