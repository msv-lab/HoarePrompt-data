Output State: **`idx1` is greater than `idx2`; `val` is an empty list; `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, `l22` are set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations; `l1` has a new element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the index position `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
