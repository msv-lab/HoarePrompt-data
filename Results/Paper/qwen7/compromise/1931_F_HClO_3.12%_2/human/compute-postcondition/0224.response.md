Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `p1` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and either `(i + 1) + 1 + max(1, p2) = n - 1` or `(i + 1) + 1 + max(1, p2) = n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `p1` is assigned the value `1`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
