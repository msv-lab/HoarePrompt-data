Output State: **`idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `val` is an empty list, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, `l22` are set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2` plus 1; `a3` is an integer read from input, and `l3` is a list of integers read from input. The element `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code inserts the element `a2` into the list `l2` at the index `idx1`. This means that `l2` now has an additional element at the specified position, while all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
