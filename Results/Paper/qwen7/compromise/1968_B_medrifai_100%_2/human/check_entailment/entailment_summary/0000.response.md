Reasoning:
The provided program seems to follow the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the lengths of strings `a` and `b`, followed by the strings themselves.
3. It initializes three variables: `i` (index for string `a`), `j` (index for string `b`), and `c` (counter for the length of the prefix).
4. It uses a while loop to iterate through both strings until either `i` reaches the end of `a` or `j` reaches the end of `b`.
5. Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1` with the current indices `i` and `j`.
6. If `func_1` returns an index greater than `j`, it means the character from `a` at index `i` was found in the substring of `b` starting from `j`. The program updates `j` to this new index, increments `i` and `c`.
7. If `func_1` returns `-1`, it means the character from `a` at index `i` was not found in the remaining part of `b`, and the loop breaks.
8. After the loop, it prints the value of `c`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.

The function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the character from `a` in the substring of `b` starting from `j`. If the character is found, it returns the correct index; otherwise, it returns `-1`.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the provided examples and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
