Output State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[ (0, 0), (1, input integer), (x, y), (x, y) ]` sorted, `res` is abs(math.sqrt(1) * math.sqrt((x - (x))^2 + (y - y)^2)), `i` is 2, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0**

Explanation: The code calculates `res` as the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. Given that `p1` is 1 and `p2` is \((x - (x))^2 + (y - y)^2\), which simplifies to \(0\) because \(x - x = 0\) and \(y - y = 0\), the value of `p2` is \(0\). The square root of \(0\) is \(0\), and the square root of \(1\) is \(1\). Therefore, `res` is \(abs(1 * 0) = 0\). All other variables remain unchanged.
