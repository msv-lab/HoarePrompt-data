Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` in the range function. The other variables mentioned (`n`, `coord`, `p1`, and `p2`) are not part of the loop head and their values will not change within the loop itself.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 4. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3.

3. **Update the value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 4.

4. **Check the condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than 4. Since `i` is now 4, the loop will not execute again.

Given these steps, let's summarize the state adjustments:

- `i` will be incremented from 3 to 4.
- The loop will not execute again because `i` is no longer less than 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which won't happen) would be:

State: **`res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[ (x, y), (x, y) ]`, `i` is 4, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0**
