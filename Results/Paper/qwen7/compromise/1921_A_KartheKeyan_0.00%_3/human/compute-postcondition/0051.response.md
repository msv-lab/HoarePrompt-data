Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(4):`.
   - The only variable involved in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < 4`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - The other variables (`x`, `y`, and `coord`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples: (1, input integer), (input integer, input integer)**
