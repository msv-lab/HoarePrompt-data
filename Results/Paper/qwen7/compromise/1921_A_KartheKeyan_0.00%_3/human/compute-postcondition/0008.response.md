Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(4):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `n` is 0
   - `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`
   - `res` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 4. 

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i`, and `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be 3 (since it was incremented from 2).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 0 again, but since it increments by 1, it will become 4 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, we need to set `i` to 0 for the next iteration.

5. **Check other variables**: The variables `n`, `coord`, and `res` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition alone.

6. **Formulate the new state**: The new state should reflect that the loop can now execute again with `i` reset to 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**
