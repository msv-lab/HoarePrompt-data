Output State: **`n` is 1, `coord` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 2, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0**

Explanation: The code `coord = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `coord`. All other variables (`n`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `coord` was a list containing four tuples, but now it is an empty list. The value of `res` is recalculated based on the new state of `coord`, which results in `res` being 0 since there are no coordinates to calculate the distance between.
