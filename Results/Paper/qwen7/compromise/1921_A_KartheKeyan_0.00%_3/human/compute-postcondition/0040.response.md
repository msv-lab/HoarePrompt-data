Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- `n` is explicitly stated to be 1.
- `coord` is a list containing four sorted tuples, but the specific values within these tuples are not provided.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 5.
- `p2` is calculated as `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, but this value is not needed to determine the output of the `print(res)` statement.

The `print(res)` statement will simply print the value of `res`.

Output: **0**
