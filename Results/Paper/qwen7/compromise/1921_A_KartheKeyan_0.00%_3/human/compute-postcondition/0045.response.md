Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(4)`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` is given as 5.

3. **Understand the behavior of the `range` function**: The `range(4)` function generates numbers from 0 to 3 (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will execute when `i` is 0, 1, 2, or 3.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since the loop will start when `i` is within the range 0 to 3, we need to adjust `i` to be one of these values. Given that `i` is initially 5, we need to set `i` to one of the values in the range 0 to 3.

5. **Consider the other variables**: The other variables (`res`, `n`, `coord`, and `p2`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be within the range 0 to 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be 0, 1, 2, or 3**
