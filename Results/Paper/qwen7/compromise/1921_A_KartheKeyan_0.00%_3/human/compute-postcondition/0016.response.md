Output State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[ (0, 0), (1, input integer), (x, y), (x, y) ]` sorted, `res` is 0, `i` is 2**.

The `sorted()` function sorts the `coord` list in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple. Since the original `coord` list contains tuples with the first elements being 0, 1, and repeated `x, y`, the sorted list will be `[ (0, 0), (1, input integer), (x, y), (x, y) ]`. The values of `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code.
