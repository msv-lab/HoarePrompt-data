Functionality: **The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case involves four lines of input representing the coordinates (x, y) of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the area of the square formed by these coordinates and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function ends with `n` set to 0, `coord` being a list of four coordinate tuples, `res` containing the calculated area, and `i` set to 6.**
