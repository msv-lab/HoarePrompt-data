Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing four sorted tuples `[ (x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y) ]`, `i` is 5, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Explanation: The code `res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))` involves the calculation of `res`, but the value of `p1` is not defined in the given code snippet. Since `p1` is not defined, we cannot compute `res`. The values of `n`, `coord`, `i`, and `p2` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of these variables.
