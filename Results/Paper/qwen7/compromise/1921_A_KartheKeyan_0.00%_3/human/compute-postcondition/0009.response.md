Output State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then assigned to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of `n`, `coord`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
