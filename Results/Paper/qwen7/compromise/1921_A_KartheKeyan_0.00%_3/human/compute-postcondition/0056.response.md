Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, input integer), (input integer, input integer), (input integer, input integer), (input integer, input integer)**.

Explanation: The loop runs for 4 iterations, and in each iteration, the user inputs two integers `x` and `y`, which are appended as a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. After the loop completes, the `coord` list contains four tuples. The `coord` list is then sorted, but since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, we keep them as "input integer". The value of `i` remains 3 as it was incremented to 3 after 4 iterations starting from 0.
