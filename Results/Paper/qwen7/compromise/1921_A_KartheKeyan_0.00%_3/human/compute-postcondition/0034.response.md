Output State: `res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[ (x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y) ]`, `i` is 5, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0.

This output state is calculated based on the given loop which runs from `i` in `range(4)`. Since the loop iterates 4 times, starting from `i` being 2, it will end with `i` being 5. During each iteration, a tuple `(x, y)` is appended to the `coord` list. Therefore, after 4 iterations, `coord` will contain 4 tuples. The values of `res`, `n`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
