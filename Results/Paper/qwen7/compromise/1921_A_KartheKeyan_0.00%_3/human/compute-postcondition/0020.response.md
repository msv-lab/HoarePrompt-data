Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[ (0, 0), (1, input integer), (x, y), (x, y) ]` sorted.
   - `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(1) * math.sqrt((x - (x))^2 + (y - y)^2))`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `p1` is 1.
   - `p2` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(res)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `n` is 0, but it is not used in the calculation of `res`.
   - `coord` is a list of tuples, but only the formula for `res` is relevant here.
   - `res` is defined as `abs(math.sqrt(1) * math.sqrt((x - (x))^2 + (y - y)^2))`.
     - `math.sqrt(1)` is 1.
     - `(x - (x))^2` simplifies to `0^2`, which is 0.
     - `math.sqrt(0)` is 0.
     - So, `math.sqrt((x - (x))^2 + (y - y)^2)` is `math.sqrt(0 + 0)`, which is 0.
     - Therefore, `res` is `abs(1 * 0)`, which is 0.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
