Output State: **`n` is 0, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[ (0, 0), (x, y) ]`, `res` is 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains one tuple `(0, 0)`. After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` now contains two tuples: `(0, 0)` and `(x, y)`. The values of `n`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.
