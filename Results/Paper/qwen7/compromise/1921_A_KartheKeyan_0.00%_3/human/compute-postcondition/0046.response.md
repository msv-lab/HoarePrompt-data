Output State: **`i` is 0, 1, 2, or 3; `x` is an input integer; `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers. These values are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was in the initial state, being either 0, 1, 2, or 3.
