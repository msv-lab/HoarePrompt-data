Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[ (x, y), (x, y) ]`, `i` is 3, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `coord.append((x, y))` adds the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains one tuple `(x, y)`. After appending, `coord` will contain two tuples: the original one and the new one added. All other variables remain unchanged.
