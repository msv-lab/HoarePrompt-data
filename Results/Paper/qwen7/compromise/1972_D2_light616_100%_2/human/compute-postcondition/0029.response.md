Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 30, and `cnt` is 1 because `math.gcd(x, y)` equals 1.**

The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. Initially, `y` is 1, so after executing the code, `y` becomes 2. The values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The condition that `math.gcd(x, y)` equals 1 is still valid, so `cnt` remains 1.
