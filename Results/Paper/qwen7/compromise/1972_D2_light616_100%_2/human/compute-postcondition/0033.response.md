Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 30, and `cnt` is 1.**

The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. Initially, `y` is 2, so after executing the code, `y` becomes 3. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
