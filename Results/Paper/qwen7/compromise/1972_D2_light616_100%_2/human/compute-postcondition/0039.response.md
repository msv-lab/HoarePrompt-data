Output State: `x` is 2, `y` is 5, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 15, and `cnt` is 6.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\). Given the initial conditions and the output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the following:

- After the first iteration, \(x = 2\), \(y = 2\), and \(cnt = 1\).
- After the second iteration, \(x = 2\), \(y = 3\), and \(cnt = 1\).
- After the third iteration, \(x = 2\), \(y = 4\), and \(cnt = 2\).

For the fourth iteration, \(y\) would increment to 5. We need to check the loop condition with \(x = 2\) and \(y = 5\):

- \((x + y) \times x = (2 + 5) \times 2 = 7 \times 2 = 14\)
- \((x + y) \times y = (2 + 5) \times 5 = 7 \times 5 = 35\)

Since \(n\) must be at least 5 and \(m\) must be at least 15, the condition \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) is satisfied if \(n \geq 14\), and the condition \((x + y) \times y \leq m\) is satisfied if \(m \geq 35\). Both conditions are met given the constraints.

Next, we check the gcd condition:
- \(\mathbf{gcd}(2, 5) = 1\), so \(cnt\) increments by \(\min(14 // 14, 35 // 35) = \min(1, 1) = 1\). Thus, \(cnt = 3\).

For the fifth iteration, \(y\) would increment to 6. However, \((x + y) \times y = 8 \times 6 = 48\), which exceeds \(m\) if \(m < 48\). Therefore, the loop terminates after the fourth iteration.

Thus, the final state is \(x = 2\), \(y = 5\), \(n\) must be at least 5, \(m\) must be at least 15, and \(cnt = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\).
