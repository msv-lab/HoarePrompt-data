Reasoning:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs (a, b) for a single test case, where the conditions are \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- `func_2` is responsible for processing multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.

Let's analyze the correctness of each function:

### Function `func_1`
- The function correctly iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` such that \(x \leq \sqrt{n}\) and \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- It uses the greatest common divisor (GCD) to check if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
- It counts the number of valid pairs by checking the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Given the example outputs and the constraints, the logic in `func_1` appears to be correct. The function correctly handles the conditions and calculates the count of valid pairs.

### Function `func_2`
- The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
- It ensures that the number of test cases `t` is within the allowed range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Given the problem constraints and the example inputs, the logic in `func_2` appears to be correct. It correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each one.

### Overall Program Correctness
- Both functions work together to handle multiple test cases and calculate the number of valid pairs for each test case.
- The program meets the problem requirements and constraints.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
