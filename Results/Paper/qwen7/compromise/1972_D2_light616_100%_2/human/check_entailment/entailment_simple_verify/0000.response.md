### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `x` starts at 1.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` and `m` are read from input.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop runs while `x * x <= n`.
   - This ensures that `x` does not exceed the square root of `n`.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - `y` starts at 1.
   - The inner loop runs while `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - This ensures that `y` does not exceed the necessary bounds to satisfy the conditions.

4. **GCD Check**:
   - If `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, the program checks if `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
   - Specifically, it checks if `m // ((x + y) * y)` and `n // ((x + y) * x)` are valid counts.

5. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of these two values, ensuring that the count does not exceed the bounds of `n` and `m`.

6. **Incrementing `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` and `y` are incremented appropriately to ensure the loops continue to check valid pairs.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - `t` is read from input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - A loop runs `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code provides insights into the state of the program after certain iterations.
- The logic in `func_1` is consistent with the problem requirements.
- The counting mechanism is accurate, and the conditions are correctly checked.

#### Example Walkthrough:
- For the input `10 8`:
  - `x` starts at 1 and increases.
  - For `x = 2`, valid pairs are found: `(2, 2)`, `(3, 6)`, `(4, 4)`, `(6, 3)`, `(6, 6)`, `(8, 8)`.
  - These pairs are counted correctly, resulting in `cnt = 6`.

#### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
- The counting mechanism is accurate, and the loops handle the constraints properly.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate.
