### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the key points to confirm this:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) up to \(\sqrt{n}\) and \(\sqrt{m}\) respectively.
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) holds, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - It ensures that the number of test cases \(t\) is processed correctly.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.
   - The output matches the expected results for the given inputs.

5. **Summary Validation**:
   - The function summary for `func_2` correctly describes its behavior, indicating that it processes a series of test cases and calls `func_1` for each one.

Given the detailed analysis and the matching outputs for the provided examples, the original assessment is accurate.
