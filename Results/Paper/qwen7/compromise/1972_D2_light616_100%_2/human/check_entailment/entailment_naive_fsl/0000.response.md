Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) to check the conditions specified in the problem statement. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case, and `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one. The logic inside `func_1` ensures that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is checked to be a multiple of \(a + b\), and the counting mechanism is accurate. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly as per the problem description.
