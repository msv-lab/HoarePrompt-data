Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- Function `func_1()` is designed to calculate the count of such pairs for a single test case. It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) (where \(x\) and \(y\) represent \(a\) and \(b\) respectively), checks the conditions, and counts the valid pairs.
- Function `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case. It also ensures that the number of test cases \(t\) is read from input and used to loop through the test cases.
- The output hints confirm that `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to count valid pairs for a single test case, and `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

Given the descriptions and the logic implemented in the functions, they collectively meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
