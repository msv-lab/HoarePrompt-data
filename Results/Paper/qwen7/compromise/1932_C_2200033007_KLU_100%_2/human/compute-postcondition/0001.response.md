Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each element a_i in the list, `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is an empty list, `l` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `l` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
