Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each element a_i in the list, `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`. After the loop executes all the iterations, `b` contains elements from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', the element at position `l` in `a` is appended to `b` and `l` is incremented. If `s[i]` is 'R', the element at position `r` in `a` is appended to `b` and `r` is decremented. The final positions of `l` and `r` will be `n-1` and 0 respectively.
