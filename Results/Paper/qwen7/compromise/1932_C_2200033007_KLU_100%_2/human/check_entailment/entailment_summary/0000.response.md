Reasoning:
1. The program correctly processes the input according to the problem description.
2. It initializes the necessary variables and iterates through the commands in the string `s`.
3. For each command, it appends the appropriate element from the list `a` to the list `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
4. After constructing the list `b`, it calculates the product of the elements in `b` modulo `m` in reverse order and stores these values in the list `ans`.
5. The final step is to return the reversed version of `ans`, which matches the required output format.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem specification accurately. However, there is a potential issue with how the product is calculated and stored in `ans`.

In the original code, the product `p` is updated in reverse order, but the result is appended to `ans` in reverse again, which means the order of the results in `ans` is correct. This is because the `reversed` function is applied twice, once during the calculation and once during the return statement.

To ensure clarity and correctness, the function could be simplified and corrected as follows:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in b:
        p = (p * v) % m
        ans.append(p)
    return ans
```

This version avoids the unnecessary use of `reversed` and directly builds the `ans` list in the correct order.

Given this analysis, the original program should work correctly as intended, despite the minor redundancy in using `reversed`.

Correctness: **True**
