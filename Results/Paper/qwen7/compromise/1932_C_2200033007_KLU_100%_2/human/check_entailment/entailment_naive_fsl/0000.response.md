Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the product of the array elements before taking the remainder. According to the problem description, the product of all elements of the array `a` should be taken modulo `m` at the beginning of each command's execution. However, the program calculates the product in reverse order and appends the results to the list `b`, which is then processed to compute the final remainders.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

The expected output should be:
```
0 2 4 1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0 0 2 4
```

This discrepancy occurs because the program incorrectly calculates the product in reverse order. The correct implementation should calculate the product of the remaining elements after each removal and then take the modulo `m`. The provided solution does not correctly handle this requirement.
