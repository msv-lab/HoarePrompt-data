Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly defines the function `func_1` that processes the commands according to the problem description.
2. The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of the array `a` based on the direction specified by the string `s`.
3. It then iterates over the string `s` and appends elements from `a` to `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
4. After constructing `b`, it calculates the product of its elements modulo `m` in reverse order and stores these results in the list `ans`.
5. Finally, it returns the reversed version of `ans`, which matches the required output format.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described. Therefore, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
