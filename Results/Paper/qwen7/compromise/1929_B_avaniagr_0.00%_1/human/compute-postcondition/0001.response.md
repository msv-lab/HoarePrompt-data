Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the conditions specified within the loop. For each input line containing integers `n` and `k`, the output will be calculated as follows:
- If \( k < 4 \times n - 3 \), the output is \(\left(\frac{k}{2} + k \mod 2\right)\).
- If \( k \geq 4 \times n - 3 \), the output is \(2 \times n\).
- If \( k = 4 \times n - 2 \), the output is also \(2 \times n\).

The output state will be a list of these calculated values for each test case.
