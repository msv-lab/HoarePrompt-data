Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after a series of moves. Each move consists of placing a rook such that no two rooks attack each other, and the computer mirrors the move if the row and column indices are different. If the indices are the same, the computer skips its turn.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate a sequence using dynamic programming.
   - The sequence is defined such that each element depends on the previous two elements, with a specific formula applied modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - The base cases are initialized as `[1, 1]`.
   - For each subsequent element from 2 to `n`, the value is calculated as \((\text{prev\_last} + 2 \times (\text{current index} - 1) \times \text{second last}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

3. **Execution Summary Analysis**:
   - The execution summary states that the function correctly computes the sequence and returns the last element of the resulting list.
   - For the given constraints, the function returns the correct value of 10302, which matches the expected output based on the problem's requirements.

4. **Program Verification**:
   - The main part of the program reads the input, processes the moves, and calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.
   - The logic for reducing the effective size of the board (`n`) based on the moves is correct, as it accounts for both mirrored and non-mirrored moves.
   - The function call and the reduction of `n` are consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
