### Reasoning

Let's break down the provided solution and verify its correctness step-by-step.

#### Problem Breakdown Recap
1. **Input**:
   - Number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case:
     - Size of the chessboard `n` and number of moves already played `k`.
     - `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)` representing the moves made by the player.

2. **Objective**:
   - Determine the number of possible final configurations of the board after all moves are made, considering the mirroring rule.
   - The result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Constraints**:
   - \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
   - Sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).

#### Provided Solution Analysis
1. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then processes `k` moves.
   - For each move, it checks if the row and column are the same (`a == b`). If they are not the same, it reduces the effective size of the board by 2 (since both positions are occupied). If they are the same, it reduces the board size by 1.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of possible configurations for a board of size `n`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks without attacking each other.
   - The base cases are `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`.
   - For each subsequent value, it uses the recurrence relation: \(dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

#### Verification
1. **Board Reduction Logic**:
   - The logic to reduce the board size based on the moves is correct. If a move is mirrored, it effectively reduces the board size by 2. If not, it reduces by 1.
   - This is because each move and its mirror occupy two distinct positions, reducing the effective board size by 2. If the move is along the diagonal, it only reduces by 1.

2. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the number of configurations using dynamic programming. The recurrence relation used is appropriate for this problem.
   - The recurrence relation \(dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) is derived from combinatorial arguments and correctly counts the number of non-attacking rook placements.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

#### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct. It correctly handles the reduction of the board size based on the moves and computes the number of configurations using dynamic programming.
