Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(2, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `dp` is a list containing `[1, 6]`.
   - `i` is 3.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 2` and goes up to `i = n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. This means the loop has already executed for `i = 2` and now it is checking if `i` should be incremented to 4.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 4 for the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`dp` is a list containing [1, 6], `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
