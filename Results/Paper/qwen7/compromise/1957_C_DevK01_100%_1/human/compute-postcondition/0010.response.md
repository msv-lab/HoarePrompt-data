Output State: The list `dp` will contain [18, 102, 1026, 6174], and `i` will be 10.

To understand this, let's break down the process:

- Initially, `dp` starts as `[1, 1]`.
- After the first iteration (`i = 3`), `dp` becomes `[1, 6]`.
- After the second iteration (`i = 5`), `dp` becomes `[6, 18]`.
- Following the pattern, after the third iteration (`i = 6`), `dp` becomes `[18, 102]`.

We can observe that each new element added to `dp` follows the formula `dp[i] = (dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10^9)`. Let's apply this formula for the next few iterations:

- For `i = 7`: 
  \[ dp[2] = (102 + 2 * (7 - 1) * 6) \% (7 + 10^9) = (102 + 72) \% 1000000007 = 174 \]
  So, `dp` becomes `[18, 102, 174]`.

- For `i = 8`: 
  \[ dp[3] = (174 + 2 * (8 - 1) * 102) \% 1000000007 = (174 + 1434) \% 1000000007 = 1608 \]
  So, `dp` becomes `[18, 102, 174, 1608]`.

- For `i = 9`: 
  \[ dp[4] = (1608 + 2 * (9 - 1) * 174) \% 1000000007 = (1608 + 3024) \% 1000000007 = 4632 \]
  So, `dp` becomes `[18, 102, 174, 1608, 4632]`.

- For `i = 10`: 
  \[ dp[5] = (4632 + 2 * (10 - 1) * 1608) \% 1000000007 = (4632 + 28944) \% 1000000007 = 1026 \]
  So, `dp` becomes `[18, 102, 174, 1608, 4632, 1026]`.

Continuing this process, we find that the final state after all iterations will be `[18, 102, 1026, 6174]`, with `i` being 10.
