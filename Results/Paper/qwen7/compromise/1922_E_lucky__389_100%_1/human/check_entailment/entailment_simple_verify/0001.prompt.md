You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.

    #
    #Explanation: After the first three iterations, we know that `subseq_lens` has been updated with the values 5, 10, and 9, and `mx` has been updated to 10. Since `x` is reduced to 0 after each iteration and the loop condition `x != 0` is no longer satisfied, the loop will terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will contain the values [5, 10, 9], `mx` will be 10, and `i` will be 0 as the inner while loop will exit when `2 ** i > x`.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values [5, 10, 9], `i` is 2, `ansv` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 9].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = len(subseq_lens) - 1`, which means it will run for a total of 2 iterations based on the given `subseq_lens` list (since `len(subseq_lens)` is 3, but the loop starts from 1). After 3 iterations as shown in the provided states, `i` is 2, indicating the loop has completed its execution. Therefore, `ansv` will contain the appended values from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end, which are [5, 5, 9]. The other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 8
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `i` is 4, `ansv` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 9, 5, 9].
    print()
    #This is printed: an empty line



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The solution should handle this by constructing an array where the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

2. **Key Insight**: The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be related to the binary representation of `X`. Specifically, if we represent `X` in binary, the number of increasing subsequences can be derived from the positions of the set bits in the binary representation.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `X`.
   - It then attempts to decompose `X` into a sum of powers of 2, which corresponds to finding the binary representation of `X`.
   - The length of the array is determined by the highest power of 2 used in the decomposition.
   - The array is constructed such that it has the required number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `X = 2`, the solution correctly prints `[0]` because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just `0`.
   - For other values of `X`, the solution constructs an array using the binary representation of `X`.

5. **Verification**:
   - The solution handles the construction of the array correctly based on the binary representation of `X`.
   - The output format is correct, printing the length of the array followed by the array elements.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
