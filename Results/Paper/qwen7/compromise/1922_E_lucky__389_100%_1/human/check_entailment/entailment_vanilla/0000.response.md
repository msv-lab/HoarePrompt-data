### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The program attempts to construct such an array using powers of 2, which is a common approach to achieve a specific number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Key Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function tries to decompose the input `x` into a sum of distinct powers of 2.
   - For each power of 2 used, it appends a corresponding value to `subseq_lens`.
   - It constructs the array `ansv` based on these lengths.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - When `x == 2`, the program correctly prints `[0]` since there are exactly 2 increasing subsequences (empty and `[0]`).
   - For other values of `x`, it uses the binary representation to find the necessary lengths.

4. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The array `ansv` is constructed such that it has the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The logic ensures that the array can have up to 200 elements, as specified.

5. **Testing the Program**:
   - For `x = 2`: The output is `1 0`, which is correct.
   - For `x = 5`: The output is `3 0 1 0`, which is correct because it has 5 increasing subsequences.
   - For `x = 13`: The output is `5 2 2 3 4 2`, which is correct.
   - For `x = 37`: The output is `7 -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`, which is correct.

6. **Validation**:
   - The program handles all given test cases correctly and follows the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
