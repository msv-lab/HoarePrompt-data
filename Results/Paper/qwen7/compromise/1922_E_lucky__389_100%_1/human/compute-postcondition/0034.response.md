Output State: `i` is 11, `x` is 2048.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(2^i \leq x\). Initially, `x` is set to 14. The loop will keep running until \(2^{11} > 14\), which is when \(2^{11} = 2048\). Therefore, `i` will be incremented from 0 up to 10, making it 11 after the loop finishes. At this point, `x` remains 14 since it is not modified within the loop.
