You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.
    #State: `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, and `subseq_lens` is an empty list. The value of `x` is not 2
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values [5, 10, 9], and `i` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: After the first three iterations, we know that `subseq_lens` has been updated with the values 5, 10, and 9, and `mx` has been updated to 10. Since `x` is reduced to 0 after each iteration and the loop condition `x != 0` is no longer satisfied, the loop will terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `x` will be 0, `subseq_lens` will contain the values [5, 10, 9], `mx` will be 10, and `i` will be 0 as the inner while loop will exit when `2 ** i > x`.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values [5, 10, 9], `i` is 2, `ansv` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 9].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = len(subseq_lens) - 1`, which means it will run for a total of 2 iterations based on the given `subseq_lens` list (since `len(subseq_lens)` is 3, but the loop starts from 1). After 3 iterations as shown in the provided states, `i` is 2, indicating the loop has completed its execution. Therefore, `ansv` will contain the appended values from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end, which are [5, 5, 9]. The other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: 8
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `i` is 4, `ansv` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 9, 5, 9].
    print()
    #This is printed: an empty line
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
