Step-by-step reasoning:

1. We know from the initial state that `i` is set to 4.
2. `ansv` is a list of length 8. Since no specific values are provided for the elements of `ansv`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ansv[i]` (which corresponds to `ansv[4]`).
3. The `print` statement uses `end=' '` to ensure that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline.

Given this information, the output will be the value at index 4 of the list `ansv`, followed by a space.

Output: **ansv[4] **
