The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`. To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `2 ** i <= x` holds true at the start of the next iteration.

Given that `i` is 3 at the end of the previous iteration, let's analyze the condition:

- The current value of `i` is 3.
- The condition `2 ** i <= x` becomes `2 ** 3 <= x`, which simplifies to `8 <= x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `2 ** (i + 1) <= x` must hold true. This means `2 ** 4 <= x`, which simplifies to `16 <= x`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `x` such that `16 <= x`.

State: **`i` is 3 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 16**
