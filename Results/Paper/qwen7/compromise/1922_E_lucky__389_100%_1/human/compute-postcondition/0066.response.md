Output State: **`mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values [5, 10, 9], `i` is 1, `ansv` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]**.

Explanation: The code appends `subseq_lens[i]` to `ansv`. Given that `i` is 1, `subseq_lens[i]` is `subseq_lens[1]`, which is 10. So, the list `ansv` is updated to include the value 5 (already present) and then 10. All other variables remain unchanged.
