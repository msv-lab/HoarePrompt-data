Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is set to 3.
2. `ansv` is a list of length 8, but it does not specify the contents of this list.
3. The print statement accesses `ansv[i]`, where `i` is 3. This means it will access the 4th element of the list `ansv` (since list indices start at 0).

Since the exact values of the elements in `ansv` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed. However, we know that the print statement will attempt to print the 4th element of the list `ansv`.

Output: **ansv[3]**
