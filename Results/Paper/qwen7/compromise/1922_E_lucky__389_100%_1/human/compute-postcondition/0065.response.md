Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(subseq_lens)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mx` is 10
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
   - `x` is 0
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values [5, 10, 9]
   - `i` is 0
   - `ansv` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop runs from `i` in the range `1` to `len(subseq_lens)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(subseq_lens)`.

4. **Calculate `len(subseq_lens)`**:
   - `subseq_lens` is a list with values [5, 10, 9].
   - Therefore, `len(subseq_lens)` is 3.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `subseq_lens` remains the same as it is a list and not modified within the loop head.
   - All other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`, `ansv`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `mx` is still 10.
   - `t` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `x` is still 0.
   - `subseq_lens` is still a list containing the values [5, 10, 9].
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `ansv` is still a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`mx` is 10, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values [5, 10, 9], `i` is 1, `ansv` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]**
