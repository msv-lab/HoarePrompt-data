Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, the array `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, the list `a` is now a list of accumulated sums starting from 0, the list `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element b[i] (for i from 1 to n) is equal to the number of times an integer greater than 1 appears before index i in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(accumulate(a))` modifies the list `a` to contain the accumulated sums of its elements, starting from 0. The other variables and lists remain unchanged in terms of their types and constraints.
