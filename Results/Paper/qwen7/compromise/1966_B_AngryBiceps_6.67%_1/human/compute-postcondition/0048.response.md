Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` is the integer obtained from the third input, `i` is \(i_{prev} + 1\), `n` is \(n_{prev} + 1\), `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the input string from the user, the second element is the new input string, and the third element is the latest input string, `first_row` is the concatenation of its previous value and the first character of the last element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to `first_row`. The values of `t`, `m`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `last_row` remain unchanged.
