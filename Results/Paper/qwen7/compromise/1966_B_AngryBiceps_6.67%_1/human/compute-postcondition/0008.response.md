Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list containing one element (the input provided), `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `last_row`. Since `a` contains only one element, which is the input provided, `a[-1]` refers to that single element, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to its last character. The value of `last_row` is updated accordingly, while all other variables remain unchanged.
