Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` will be equal to `n` (which is the total number of iterations), `n` is the count of how many times the loop ran, `a` contains all the input strings provided during the loop, `first_row` is constructed by taking the first character of each string in the list `a`, `last_row` is constructed by taking the last character of each string in the list `a`. Additionally, the first string in the list `a` consists of the same character repeated, and the first string is different from the last string in the list `a`.**
