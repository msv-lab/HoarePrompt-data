Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is updated to the value of `n` from the input split, `a` now contains the input strings provided during the loop plus one more string, `first_row` is constructed by taking the first character of each string in the list `a`, and `last_row` is constructed by taking the last character of each string in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are updated according to the new input. `t` remains unchanged, `m` gets the second value from the input, `i` is updated to `n + 1`, and `n` gets the first value from the input. The list `a` and the strings `first_row` and `last_row` are updated based on the new input.
