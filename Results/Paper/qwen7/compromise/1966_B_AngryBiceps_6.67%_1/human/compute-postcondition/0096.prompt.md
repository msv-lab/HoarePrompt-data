You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and a grid of size n × m filled with characters 'W' and 'B'. The sum of n·m over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `m` retains the value it had after the first input, `a` is a list containing `n` elements (each element being an input provided during the loop's iterations), `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of each element in list `a`, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of the second element in list `a` repeated `n-1` times, followed by the last character of the last element in list `a`. The conditions specified in the if part hold if either the first string in the list `a` consists of the same character repeated and is different from the last string in the list `a`, or the first string in the list `a` does not consist of a single character repeated and is not equal to the last string. Otherwise, the conditions specified in the else part hold.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and each cell in the grid contains either 'W' or 'B'. Additionally, it accepts a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it returns information about the grid based on certain conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
