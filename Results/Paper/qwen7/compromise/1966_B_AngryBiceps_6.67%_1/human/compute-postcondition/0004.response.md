Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string.**

The code `last_row = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `last_row`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `first_row`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
