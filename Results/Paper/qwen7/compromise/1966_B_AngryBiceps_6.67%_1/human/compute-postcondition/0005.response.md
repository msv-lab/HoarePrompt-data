Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function arguments `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first input.
   - `m` is an integer obtained from the second input.
   - `a` is an empty list.
   - `first_row` is an empty string.
   - `last_row` is an empty string.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The value of `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 until `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop depends on `n`, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it must be 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string**.
