You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: t is an integer greater than 2 and between 1 and 500, i is t, s is a string with more than one character, count is 4, flag is True, and j is the length of the string s.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string consists entirely of '1's. For example, consider the input "11111". According to the problem description, this string can be rearranged into a sorted binary string with just 1 piece. However, the program will incorrectly count this as needing 5 pieces because it increments `count` for each change in character, which happens for every consecutive pair in a string of all '1's.

To fix this, the program should check if the entire string is composed of '1's and handle this special case separately. Here is a modified version of the program that addresses this issue:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        if s == '1' * len(s):  # Check if the string is all '1's
            count = 1
        else:
            j = 0
            while j < len(s) - 1:
                if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                    count += 1
                    if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                        flag = True
                        j += 1
                j += 1
            if flag:
                count -= 1
        print(count)
```

This modification ensures that the program correctly handles strings that consist entirely of '1's, making it conform to the problem description for all potential cases.
