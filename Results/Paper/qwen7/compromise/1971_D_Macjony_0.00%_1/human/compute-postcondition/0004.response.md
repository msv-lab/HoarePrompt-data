Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, `s` is the string input by the user, `count` is 1, `flag` is False**

The code initializes the variable `flag` to `False`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, or `count`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
