Output State: **`empty` is False, `t` is the integer input value, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `n` is the integer input value, `edges` is a list of edges entered during the loop, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each key from 1 to `n` has a list of its adjacent nodes, `ends` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ends = []` initializes an empty list named `ends`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
