### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step using the function summaries and the problem description.

1. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function determines if a permutation of length `n` with Manhattan value `k` exists.
   - It checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
   - If `k` is odd or `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function constructs a permutation with the given `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iteratively swaps elements to adjust the Manhattan value until it either reaches the desired value or determines that no such permutation exists.
   - If `k` is zero, it returns the current list `l`.
   - If `k` is less than `i - 1`, it calls `func_2` to swap elements.
   - Otherwise, it adjusts `k` and calls `func_3` to swap elements.

3. **Function `func_2` and `func_3`:**
   - These functions swap elements in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - `func_2` swaps the last `c` elements and the element `k` positions before the last `c` elements.
   - `func_3` swaps the last `c` elements and the element at position `c - 1`.

4. **Function `func_5`:**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation and returns.

5. **Function `func_6`:**
   - This function orchestrates the entire process.
   - It first calls `func_4` to check if a valid permutation exists.
   - If `n` is zero, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k` and then calls `func_5` with the result.

### Analysis:

1. **Handling Odd `n` and Even `k`:**
   - When `n` is odd and `k` is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \((n^2 - 1) / 2\).
   - The function `func_4` correctly identifies if `k` exceeds this maximum value and returns `(0, 0)`.

2. **Constructing Permutations:**
   - The function `func_1` uses a greedy approach to construct permutations.
   - It iteratively adjusts the Manhattan value by swapping elements.
   - The swapping logic in `func_2` and `func_3` ensures that the Manhattan value is adjusted correctly.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases like `n = 1` and `k = 1` correctly by returning "NO" because no permutation of length 1 can have a Manhattan value of 1.
   - Other edge cases like `n = 1` and `k = 0` are handled correctly by returning the single element permutation.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly handles all specified cases and edge cases. The function `func_4` accurately determines if a valid permutation exists, and `func_1` constructs the permutation correctly. The overall structure and logic of the program align with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided function summaries.
