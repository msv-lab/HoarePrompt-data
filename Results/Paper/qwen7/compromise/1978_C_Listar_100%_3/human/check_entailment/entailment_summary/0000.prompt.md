Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3 4
    
    4 5
    
    7 0
    
    1 1000000000000
    
    8 14
    
    112 777
    
    5 12
    
    5 2

    Yes
    3 1 2
    No
    Yes
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    No
    Yes
    8 2 3 4 5 6 1 7
    No
    Yes
    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes
    2 1 3 4 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
T = int(input())
for i in range(T):
    func_6()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        if k == 0:
            return l
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        k = k - i + 1
        l = func_3(c, l)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5) and `k` (an integer between 0 and 10^12). It reduces `k` by half, initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`, and iterates over `l` in reverse order. If `k` becomes zero, it returns the list `l`. If `k` is less than the current index minus one, it calls another function `func_2` with parameters `c`, `k`, and `l`. Otherwise, it decrements `k` and calls another function `func_3` with parameters `c` and `l`. Finally, it returns the modified list `l` where `c` is 1, `k` is 0, and `l` contains integers from 1 to `n`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(c, k, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[-c - k])
    (l[-c], l[-c - k]) = (y, x)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts three parameters: `c` (a non-negative integer less than the length of list `l`), `k` (a non-negative integer), and `l` (a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`). After executing, it returns the list `l` with the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` swapped.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(c, l):
    (x, y) = (l[-c], l[c - 1])
    (l[c - 1], l[-c]) = (x, y)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts a positive integer `c` and a list of integers `l`. It swaps the elements at indices `-c` and `c-1` in the list `l` and returns the modified list.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2:
        return (0, 0)
    if n % 2:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    if max_k < k:
        return (0, 0)
    return (n, k)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts no parameters and returns either two zeros or two values where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). If `n` is odd, `k` is set to `n`. If `n` is even, `k` remains as the original value of `k`, but `k` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to its original value.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts a list of integers `l`. It prints "YES" followed by each integer in the list separated by spaces. After printing, it returns an empty list.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    (n, k) = func_4()
    if n == 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the outputs of `func_4()` and `func_1()`. It first checks if `n` (obtained from `func_4()`) is zero. If so, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately. Otherwise, it calls `func_1()` with `n` and `k` (also obtained from `func_4()`), then calls `func_5()` with the result of `func_1()`, and finally returns the result of `func_5()`.
