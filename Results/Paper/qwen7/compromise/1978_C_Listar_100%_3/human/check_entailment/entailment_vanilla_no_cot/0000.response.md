Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The function `func_1` does not handle all edge cases properly. For instance, it does not correctly manage permutations when `k` is odd or when the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) is less than `k`.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It attempts to build a permutation by swapping elements, but this approach does not guarantee that the Manhattan value will match `k`. Additionally, the function does not always return a valid permutation that satisfies the required Manhattan value.

3. **Incomplete Implementation**: Some parts of the solution are incomplete or not fully implemented. For example, `func_2` and `func_3` are helper functions that do not seem to be used correctly within `func_1`.

4. **Missing Handling of Even and Odd `n`**: The function `func_4` does not handle the case where `n` is even and `k` is odd, which should result in "No" since no permutation can achieve an odd Manhattan value for an even-length permutation.

5. **Incorrect Output Handling**: The function `func_5` prints the permutation correctly, but the overall structure and logic of the solution need to be fixed.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement a more robust algorithm that can handle all cases, including edge cases where no permutation exists.
