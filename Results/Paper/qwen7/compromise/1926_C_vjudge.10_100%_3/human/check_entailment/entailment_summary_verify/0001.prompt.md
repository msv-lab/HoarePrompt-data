You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and then reads `t` integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). It calculates the sum of the digit sums from 1 to each `n` and stores these sums in a list `values`. Finally, it prints the sum of the digit sums for each `n` from the precomputed `values` list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes `inf` to `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`, which is a large enough upper bound for the input `n`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then precomputes the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to `inf` and stores these sums in the `values` array.

2. **Precomputation Loop:**
   - For each number `i` from 1 to `inf`, it calculates the sum of its digits.
   - It updates the `values` array such that `values[i]` holds the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.

3. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It prints `values[n]`, which is the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Precomputation Accuracy:**
   - The precomputation loop correctly calculates the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `inf`.
   - The cumulative sum is stored in the `values` array, ensuring that `values[i]` is the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.

2. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The test cases are handled correctly by reading `n` and printing `values[n]`.
   - This ensures that the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n` is printed for each test case.

3. **Time Complexity:**
   - The precomputation step has a time complexity of \(O(\text{inf}) = O(2 \times 10^5)\).
   - Each test case query is answered in constant time \(O(1)\) since it directly accesses the precomputed value.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the solution by precomputing the sum of digits for all numbers up to `2 * 10^5` and then efficiently answering each test case query using the precomputed values.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
