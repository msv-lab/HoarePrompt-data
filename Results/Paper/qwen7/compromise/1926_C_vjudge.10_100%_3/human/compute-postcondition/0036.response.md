Output State: The final state of the loop will be such that for every index `i` from 1 to 200001, `values[i]` will hold the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`. Specifically, `values[i]` will store the sum of `values[i-1]` plus the sum of the digits of `i`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `values[i]` for each `i` from 1 to 200001 will contain the total sum of the digit sums from 1 up to `i`.
