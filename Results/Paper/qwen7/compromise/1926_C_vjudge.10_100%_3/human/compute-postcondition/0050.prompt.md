You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of the `values` list will be such that each index `i` from 1 to 200000 will hold the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`. In other words, `values[i]` will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`.
    #
    #To explain further, for each integer `i` from 1 to 200000, the loop calculates the sum of its digits (`sum_value_digits`) and updates `values[i]` to be the previous value of `values[i-1]` plus `sum_value_digits`. This process continues until the loop has iterated through all possible values up to 200000. Thus, `values[i]` accumulates the total sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for every `i` in the range from 1 to 200000.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of the `values` list will contain 200,000 elements where each element `values[i]` (for `i` ranging from 0 to 199,999) holds the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i+1`. In other words, `values[i]` will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i+1` for every `i` in the range from 0 to 199,999.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `values` list will be fully populated with the required sums, starting from `values[0]` which will be the digit sum of 1, and ending with `values[199999]` which will be the sum of the digit sums from 1 to 200,000.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5). For each test case, it processes `t` and `n` and returns different outputs based on the values of `t` and `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
