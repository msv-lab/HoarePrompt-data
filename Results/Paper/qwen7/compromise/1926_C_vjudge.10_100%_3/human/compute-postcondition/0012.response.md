Output State: `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the integer values of all the digits in the string representation of `i`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `sum_value_digits` will hold the total sum of the digits in the string representation of `i`. For example, if `i` is "123", then `sum_value_digits` will be 6 (1 + 2 + 3).
