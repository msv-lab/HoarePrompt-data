Output State: `i` is 3, `sum_value_digits` is 6, `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`.

To understand this, let's break down the process:

- Initially, `i` is set to 1, `sum_value_digits` is 0, and `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`.
- The loop runs based on the digits of `i`. For `i = 1`, the digits are '1', so `sum_value_digits` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`.
- After the first iteration, `i` increments to 2 (since we're considering the next integer).
- For `i = 2`, the digits are '2', so `sum_value_digits` becomes `1 + 2 = 3`.
- After the second iteration, `i` increments to 3.
- For `i = 3`, the digits are '3', so `sum_value_digits` becomes `3 + 3 = 6`.
- After the third iteration, `i` increments to 4.

Thus, after all iterations, `i` is 3, `sum_value_digits` is 6, and `values[1]` remains `values[0] + 0` as it was not affected by the loop.
