The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop index) and `t`. Since `_` is a placeholder and does not change the condition of the loop, we focus on adjusting `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is 200000. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `t` must have been decremented from 200001 to 200000.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be 199999.

State: **`t` is 199999, `values` is an empty list or initialized to a list of zeros, `value` is an input integer**
