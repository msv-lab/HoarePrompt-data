Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `sum_value_digits` is 1
- `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for x in str(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `x` is derived from `str(i)`.
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`.

2. **Determine the Current Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, `str(i)` is "1".

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will iterate once for each character in the string "1".
   - For `i = 1`, the first and only iteration will occur with `x` being '1'.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - After the first iteration, `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `sum_value_digits` is also not modified within the loop.
   - `values[1]` is not directly related to the loop and remains unchanged unless modified within the loop.

5. **Next Iteration Conditions:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must change such that `str(i)` contains more than one character.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2 (as it needs to have more than one digit).

### New State for the Next Iteration:
- `i` must be 2.
- `sum_value_digits` remains unchanged.
- `values[1]` remains unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `sum_value_digits` is 1, `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`**
