Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Evaluate `n // (n - k + 1)` when `n = 0`:**
   - Since `n` is 0, the expression `n - k + 1` becomes `-k + 1`.
   - The floor division `0 // (-k + 1)` results in `0` because any non-zero number divided into zero gives zero.

3. **Evaluate `n // 1` when `n = 0`:**
   - The floor division `0 // 1` also results in `0` because zero divided by any non-zero number is zero.

4. **Calculate `h`:**
   - `h` is the sum of `0` and `0`, so `h = 0 + 0 = 0`.

5. **Check the condition `h >= k`:**
   - Given that `h` is 0, this condition `0 >= k` must be true for `h` to be greater than or equal to `k`. This implies that `k` must be 0 or a negative number. However, since `k` is typically a positive integer in such contexts, let's assume `k` is 0 for the sake of this problem.

6. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given these steps, the print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
