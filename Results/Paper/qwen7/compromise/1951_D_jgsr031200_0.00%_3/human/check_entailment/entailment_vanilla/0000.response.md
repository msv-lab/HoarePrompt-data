Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. The solution should output "YES" or "NO" and, if "YES", also provide the number of stalls and their respective prices.

### Given Program Analysis
The given program has a few issues and does not fully address the problem requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called properly within the main loop.
2. **Logic for Setting Up Stalls**: The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the process of Alice buying jewels from multiple stalls. It only considers two specific prices and does not handle the general case.
3. **Output Format**: The output format is not consistent with the problem statement. For example, it prints "YES" or "NO" without the required details when the answer is "YES".

### Correct Solution Outline
To solve this problem correctly:
1. **Single Stall Case**: If `n >= k`, we can set the price to 1 coin per jewel, allowing Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
2. **Multiple Stalls Case**: We need to distribute the prices across multiple stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This can be achieved by setting the prices in a way that Alice buys the required number of jewels from each stall.

### Corrected Program
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Single stall case
    if n >= k:
        print("YES")
        print(1)
        print(1)
        continue
    
    # Multiple stalls case
    stalls = []
    current_jewels = k
    for i in range(1, 61):
        price = n // current_jewels
        if price > 10**18:
            break
        stalls.append(price)
        current_jewels -= 1
        if current_jewels == 0:
            break
    
    if len(stalls) > 0:
        print("YES")
        print(len(stalls))
        print(" ".join(map(str, stalls)))
    else:
        print("NO")
```

### Explanation
1. **Single Stall Case**: If `n >= k`, Alice can buy `k` jewels at 1 coin each.
2. **Multiple Stalls Case**: We try to set up stalls with decreasing prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. We start with the highest possible price and decrease it for each stall until `k` jewels are covered.

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the logic for setting up multiple stalls and distributing prices. The corrected program above addresses these issues and should produce the correct output according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: False**
