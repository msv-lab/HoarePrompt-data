### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided example cases.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` (number of coins) and `k` (number of jewels required).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `n` and `k` as inputs.
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin, ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot afford even one jewel in any stall.
   - If `n >= k`, it attempts to set up stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Stall Pricing Logic**:
   - The logic in the function for the case `n >= k` is flawed. It tries to calculate the number of stalls and their prices but does not correctly ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - Specifically, the code snippet:
     ```python
     costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
     h = 0
     for i in costs:
         curr = n // i
         h += curr
         n -= i * curr
     ```
     - This logic only considers two possible prices: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
     - It then distributes `n` among these two prices, but it does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
     - The final check `if (h < k):` is also incorrect because `h` is the sum of the number of jewels Alice can buy at the prices `n - k + 1` and `1`, not the actual number of jewels she buys.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (7, 3):
     - `n = 7`, `k = 3`
     - The function correctly prints "YES" and sets up 3 stalls with prices `[3, 2, 2]` to ensure Alice buys exactly 3 jewels.
   - For the second test case (6, 4):
     - `n = 6`, `k = 4`
     - The function incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not correctly distribute the jewels.
   - For the third test case (255, 8):
     - `n = 255`, `k = 8`
     - The function incorrectly prints "YES" and sets up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`, but this does not ensure Alice buys exactly 8 jewels.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in all cases. The logic for setting up stalls and distributing prices is flawed and does not meet the requirements of the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**
