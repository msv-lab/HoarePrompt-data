Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.
2. **Case When n == k**: The program handles the case when `n` equals `k` correctly by printing 'YES' followed by 1 twice.
3. **Case When n < k**: The program correctly identifies this case and prints 'NO'.
4. **General Case**: For the general case, the program attempts to calculate the number of stalls needed and the prices for those stalls. However, there are several issues:
   - The logic for calculating the number of stalls and their prices is flawed. Specifically, the calculation `h += curr` and `n -= i * curr` does not correctly simulate Alice's greedy buying process.
   - The program assumes that Alice will buy from exactly two stalls, which is not necessarily true. The problem statement allows for up to 60 stalls.
   - The program incorrectly prints 'YES' and 2 without verifying if the calculated prices allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
