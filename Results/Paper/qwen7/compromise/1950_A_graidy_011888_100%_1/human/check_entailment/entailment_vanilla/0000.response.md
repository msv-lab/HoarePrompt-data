Let's reason through the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the numbers form a stair.
   - It checks if `a < b and b > c` to determine if the numbers form a peak.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

Given the conditions specified in the problem statement:
- A stair is defined as `a < b < c`.
- A peak is defined as `a < b and b > c`.

The program's logic aligns perfectly with these definitions:
- The condition `a < b < c` directly checks for a stair.
- The condition `a < b and b > c` directly checks for a peak.

There are no logical errors or omissions in the program that would cause it to misinterpret the conditions or produce incorrect outputs based on the provided examples.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness: **True**
