Output State: **`i` is removed from `alphabet`, `s1` contains characters from `s` that are in the updated `alphabet`, `s` remains a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k-1` lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation: The code removes the character `i` from the set `alphabet`. Since `i` was the next character in `s` and `s1` contained characters from `s` that were in `alphabet`, `i` is now removed from `alphabet`. Consequently, `s1` will no longer contain `i`. The string `s` and its length `m` remain unchanged, as well as the fact that `s` comprises only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The set `alphabet` now contains the first `k-1` lowercase English alphabets since `i` has been removed.
