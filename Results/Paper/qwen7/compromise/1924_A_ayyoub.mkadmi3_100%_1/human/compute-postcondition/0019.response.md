Output State: **`i` is the next character in `s`, `s1` contains characters from `s` that are in the `alphabet` plus the character `i`, `s` remains a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k-1` lowercase English alphabets if `len(alphabet) != 1`, otherwise `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `s2` is `s2` plus the character `i` if `len(alphabet) == 1`.**

This means that the variable `s1` now includes the character `i` appended to it, while the other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
