Output State: **`i` is the next character in `s`, `s1` contains characters from `s` that are in the `alphabet` plus the character `i` added to `s1`, `s` remains a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k-1` or `k` lowercase English alphabets depending on the condition, and `s2` is `s2` plus the character `i`.**

Explanation: The code `s1 += i` appends the character `i` to the string `s1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
