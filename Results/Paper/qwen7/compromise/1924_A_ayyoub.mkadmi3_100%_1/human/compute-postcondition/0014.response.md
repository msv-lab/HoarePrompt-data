Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `s1` is a string where each character from `s` is added to `s1` if it is in the `alphabet`.
   - `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `i` is a character from the string `s`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If `i` is in the `alphabet`, then `i` is added to `s1`.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is a character from the string `s`.
   - `s1` contains characters from `s` that are in the `alphabet`.
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `alphabet` remains unchanged.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in the string `s`.

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, the only variable that changes is `i`.
   - `s` and `alphabet` remain unchanged.

Given that `i` is a character from `s` and the loop continues as long as there are more characters in `s`, the next value of `i` will be the next character in `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`i` is the next character in `s`, `s1` contains characters from `s` that are in the `alphabet`, `s` remains a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets**.
