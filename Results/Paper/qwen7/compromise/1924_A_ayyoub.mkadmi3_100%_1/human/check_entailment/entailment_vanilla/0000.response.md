Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes the string `s` to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - It initializes an empty string `s1` and `s2`.
   - It creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if each character is in the `alphabet`:
     - If the character is in `alphabet`, it removes the character from `alphabet` if `alphabet` has more than one character.
     - Otherwise, it appends the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet` to the full set of the first `k` alphabets.
     - It appends the character to `s1`.
   - It calculates the remainder `r` of the length of `s1` divided by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`:
     - The first element checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - The second element is a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k`.
     - The third element is `s2`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` and checks the result.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it appends 'No' to `OUT` and constructs a string `s2 + be9i` where `be9i` is a string of length `n - len(s2)` using the first `k` alphabets that are not in `s1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it appends 'Yes' to `OUT`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints each element in `OUT`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`. Instead, it checks if a specific sequence of characters exists in `s` and ignores the order and frequency of characters.
   
2. **Construction of Non-Subsequence String:**
   - The construction of the non-subsequence string `s2 + be9i` assumes that `s1` contains all necessary characters but does not ensure that the constructed string is indeed a valid non-subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
