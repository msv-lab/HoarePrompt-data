Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
   - The only variable mentioned here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
   - Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, the loop will definitely execute if `t` is at least 1.

3. **Adjust the Initial State:**
   - The initial state given is that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0**
