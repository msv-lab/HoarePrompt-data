Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program attempts to find the first and last positions of chips ('1') in the string representation of the array and then calculates the number of zeros ('0') between these positions. However, this approach does not account for the fact that chips can only move to the closest free cell to the left, and it does not ensure that the final configuration has no free cells between chips.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The program outputs `1`, but the correct output should be `1` as well, which the program does get right. However, for the input:
```
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
The program incorrectly outputs `2`, but the correct output should be `2`. The program fails to handle the case where chips need to move past multiple free cells to form a single block.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the minimum number of operations by considering the distance each chip needs to move to the nearest free cell to the left and ensuring that all chips end up in a contiguous block without any free cells in between.
