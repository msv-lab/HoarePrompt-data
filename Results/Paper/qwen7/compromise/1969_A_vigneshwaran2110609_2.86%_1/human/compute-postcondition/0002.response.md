Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of the integer input from the user using `int(input())`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid, but since `n` is not directly involved in the code, it remains as a precondition.
