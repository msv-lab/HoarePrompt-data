Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `i` is `n`
   - `x` is a positive integer and less than `n`
   - `flag` is `True`
   - `l` is a list of integers created from the input

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `i < n`. Given that `i` is currently equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will not execute again because the condition `i < n` will be false.

5. **Adjusting States**: Since the loop will not execute again due to the current state of `i` being equal to `n`, no adjustments are needed for the loop variables `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are not applicable in this case because the loop will not run again.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n`, `x` is a positive integer and less than `n`, `flag` is `True`, and `l` is a list of integers created from the input.**
