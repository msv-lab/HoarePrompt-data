Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `x`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` is a positive integer
   - `n` is greater than 0 (though this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `flag` is True (though this variable is not part of the loop head)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - `x` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Ensure the loop continues**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `x`. Given that `i` is currently 1, `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is a positive integer greater than 1**
