Output State: **`i` is `n`, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is `True`, and `l` is a list of integers created from the input.**

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `x`. The other variables (`i`, `flag`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
