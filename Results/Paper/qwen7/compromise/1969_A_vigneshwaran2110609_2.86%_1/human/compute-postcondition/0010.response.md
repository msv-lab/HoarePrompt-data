Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `flag` is True. If `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur in the case where `l[l[i] - 1]` is not equal to `l[i] - 1`.
