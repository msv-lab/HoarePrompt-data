Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `x-1`, `x` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 0, and either `flag` is True (meaning that for some `i` in the range of `x`, `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`), or `flag` remains False (meaning that no such `i` exists where `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `n`, `x` is a positive integer and less than `n`, `flag` is `True`, and `l` is a list of integers created from the input.

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `i` will be `n` because the loop runs from `0` to `x-1` (inclusive), so after `x` iterations, `i` becomes `x`. However, since `x` is a positive integer and less than `n`, `i` will be incremented to `n`. The variable `flag` is set to `True` as soon as the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is met within any iteration of the loop, and the loop breaks. Therefore, regardless of how many times the loop runs, once the condition is met, `flag` remains `True`. The list `l` and the value of `x` do not change during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `flag` remains `True`, `i` is `x`, `x` is the final value it reached after completing all iterations, and `l` is the list of integers created from the input. The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches the value of `x`. If the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is ever met during any iteration, the loop breaks and prints `2`. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, it prints `3`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `x`, `flag` will still be `True` (unless broken out of early), and the loop will have either printed `2` if the condition was met at any point or printed `3` if the condition was never met.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
