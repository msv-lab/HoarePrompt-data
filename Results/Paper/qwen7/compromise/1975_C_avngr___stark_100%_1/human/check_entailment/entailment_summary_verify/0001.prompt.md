You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (size of the array), and an array `a` of `n` positive integers. If `n` is 2, it prints the minimum of `a`. Otherwise, it finds the maximum value among the second largest elements in all possible three-element sublists of `a` and prints this value. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Handling Small Arrays:**
   - If `n == 2`, the program prints the minimum of the two elements.
   - This is correct because for an array of length 2, the only way to make all elements equal is to set them both to the minimum value.

3. **Finding the Maximum Median:**
   - The program initializes `max` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the array from index 0 to `n-3` (i.e., `n-2` iterations).
   - For each iteration, it takes a subarray of length 3 starting at the current index.
   - It sorts this subarray and checks if the middle element (second element in the sorted subarray) is greater than the current `max`.
   - If it is, it updates `max` with this value.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all possible subarrays of length 3, the program prints `max`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Handling of Subarray Lengths:**
   - The program only considers subarrays of length 3. However, the problem allows any subarray `[a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]` where `1 \leq l < r \leq n`.
   - This means the program might miss out on updating `max` with the correct value if the maximum median is found in a subarray of length greater than 3.

2. **Median Calculation:**
   - The program uses sorting to find the median of each subarray of length 3. While this works for subarrays of length 3, it is inefficient for larger subarrays.
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible value of the number after performing the operations, which should consider all possible subarrays, not just those of length 3.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it only considers subarrays of length 3 and does not handle all possible subarrays as required by the problem statement. Therefore, it does not guarantee finding the maximum possible value of the number.
