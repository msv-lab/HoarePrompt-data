Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `temp` is sorted version of `[a[2], a[3], a[4]]`
   - `max` is either `temp[1]` if `temp[1] > max` is true, or remains `max` (which is initially 0) otherwise
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 2):
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n - 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - Therefore, `i` should be 3.
   - Since `i` is now 3, the condition `i < n - 2` must still hold true. This means `n` must be greater than 4 (since `i` is 3 and `n - 2` must be greater than 3).

4. **Other States:**
   - `temp` is sorted version of `[a[2], a[3], a[4]]`, and since no operations are mentioned that would change this list, `temp` remains the same.
   - `max` is either `temp[1]` if `temp[1] > max` is true, or remains `max` (which is initially 0) otherwise. Since no operations are mentioned that would change this value, `max` remains the same.
   - `t` must be greater than 0, and since no operations are mentioned that would change this value, `t` remains the same.
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, and since no operations are mentioned that would change this list, `a` remains the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, `temp` is sorted version of [a[2], a[3], a[4]], `max` is either `temp[1]` if `temp[1] > max` is true, or remains `max` (which is initially 0) otherwise, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string**
