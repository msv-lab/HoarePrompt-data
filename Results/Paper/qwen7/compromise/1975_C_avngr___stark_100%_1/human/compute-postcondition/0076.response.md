Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `temp` is sorted version of [a[2], a[3], a[4]], `max` is either `temp[1]` or 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string. If `temp[1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to `temp[1]`. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.
