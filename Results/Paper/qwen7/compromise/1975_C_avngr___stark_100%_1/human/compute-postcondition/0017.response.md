Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is equal to the maximum value between `temp[1]` and the original `max`, `n - 2` is less than 1, `temp` is a slice of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 3`, and `temp` is sorted.
