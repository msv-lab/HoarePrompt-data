The only object in the loop head is `_` (which is just a placeholder variable) and `t`. Since the loop has already executed all its iterations, `t` must have been reduced to 0 at the end of the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` needs to be greater than 0.

Given that the loop has completed all its iterations, `t` should now be 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 2, `temp` is [1, 3, 3], `max` remains as 3, `n` is still 3, `t` must be greater than 0**
