Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `i` and `n - 2`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n - 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `temp` is [0, 1, 3]
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is 3
   - `n - 2` is 1

4. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 2`. Currently, `i` is 0 and `n - 2` is 1. Since 0 is less than 1, the loop can continue.

5. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `n - 2` remains the same, which is 1.

6. **Postcondition check**: The postcondition checks if `temp[1]` (which is 1) is greater than `max` (which is also 1). Since they are equal, the postcondition remains unchanged. However, this does not affect the loop condition or the state variables directly.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are those in the loop head, specifically `i` and `n - 2`.

**State: **`temp` is [0, 1, 3], `i` is 1, `n - 2` is 1**
