Output State: **`temp` is [1, 3, 3], `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `temp` in ascending order. Initially, `temp` is `[3, 3, 1]`. After sorting, `temp` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
