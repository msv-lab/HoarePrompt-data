Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 2, `temp` is a sorted list of three consecutive elements starting from `a[n-5]`, `max` is the second largest element among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-3`. The condition `temp[1] > max` ensures that `max` is updated to the second largest value among any three consecutive elements in the list `a`. Therefore, `max` will hold the highest possible second largest value found in any triplet of consecutive elements in the list `a`.
