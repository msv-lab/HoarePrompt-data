You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `rev_res` is a string that alternates between the integer values of `rev_val` and their reversed forms, starting with the first element of `rev_val` and ending with its last element. If the final value of `rev_res` is greater than \(10^{\text{int(max_power)}}\), the loop prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two inputs: the length of a list and the maximum power of 10. It then reads a list of integers. The function reverses each integer in the list and constructs a new string by alternating between the original reversed integers and their normal form, starting with the first reversed integer. Finally, it compares this constructed string (interpreted as an integer) with \(10\) raised to the power of the maximum power read. If the constructed integer is greater, it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `y`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the list `list_len` and the parameter `max_power`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `operational_list`.

2. **Reversing Digits**:
   - The program iterates over each integer in `operational_list`.
   - For each integer, it reverses the digits and stores the result in `x_rev`.
   - If the length of the reversed integer is the same as the original integer, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_res` without modification.
   - Otherwise, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Reconstructing**:
   - The program sorts `rev_val` (which contains integers whose lengths changed after reversing).
   - It then reconstructs `rev_res` by alternating between elements from `rev_val` and their reversed forms.

4. **Winning Condition Check**:
   - Finally, it checks if the reconstructed string `rev_res` (converted to an integer) is greater than or equal to \(10^{max_power}\).
   - If true, it prints 'Sasha'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Anna'.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Handling of Reversed Integers**:
   - The program should handle the reversed integers correctly but does not properly manage the concatenation of integers.
   - The program incorrectly appends the reversed integers directly to `rev_res` without converting them back to strings and concatenating them appropriately.

2. **Sorting and Reconstructing Logic**:
   - The sorting and reconstructing logic is flawed because it alternates between elements from `rev_val` and their reversed forms without ensuring the correct order for Sasha’s turn to concatenate and reduce the list size.

3. **Winning Condition Check**:
   - The winning condition check is based on the final string `rev_res`, which is not correctly formed due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
