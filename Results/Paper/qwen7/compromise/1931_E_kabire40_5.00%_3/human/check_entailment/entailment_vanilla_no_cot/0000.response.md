Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the rules of the game. Here are the key issues:

1. **Reversing Digits**: The program attempts to reverse the digits of the numbers in the list but does not handle the reversal properly. It should reverse the digits of each number and then compare the lengths to decide whether to append the original number or its reversed form to `rev_res`.

2. **Game Logic**: The program does not simulate the actual game where players take turns. Instead, it only reverses the digits and concatenates the results, which does not reflect the game's rules accurately.

3. **Winning Condition**: The program checks if the final concatenated number is greater than \(10^{max\_power}\) to determine the winner, but this is not how the game works. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, and the winner is determined based on the last remaining number after Anna's move.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the game turns and check the conditions based on the optimal strategy for both players. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        operational_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Reverse the digits of each number in the list
        reversed_list = [str(num)[::-1] for num in operational_list]
        
        # Function to check if Sasha can win
        def can_sasha_win(operational_list, reversed_list):
            while len(operational_list) > 1:
                # Anna's turn: Reverse a number
                if len(operational_list) > 1:
                    reversed_list.sort()
                    a = reversed_list.pop(0)
                    b = reversed_list.pop(0)
                    reversed_list.append(a + b)
                
                # Sasha's turn: Concatenate two numbers
                if len(operational_list) > 1:
                    a = reversed_list.pop(0)
                    b = reversed_list.pop(0)
                    reversed_list.append(a + b)
            
            # Check if the final number is >= 10^m
            return int(reversed_list[0]) >= 10**m
        
        # Determine the winner
        if can_sasha_win(operational_list, reversed_list[:]):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')

func()
```

This code simulates the game turns and checks if Sasha can force a win based on the optimal strategy.
