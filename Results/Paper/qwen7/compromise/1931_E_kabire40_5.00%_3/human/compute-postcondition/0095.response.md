Postcondition: **`rev_res` is the sum of the integers in `rev_val` with the additional value of either the integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `x+1` is even) or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `x+1` is odd). `rev_val` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `x % 2 == 0`, `rev_res` is concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is updated by adding the reverse of `val_in`.**
