Output State: **All strings in `operational_list` have been processed. For each string `x` in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`. If the length of `x_rev` as a string is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `rev_res` will contain the sum of all integers formed by reversing strings in `operational_list` where the reversed string's length matches the original string's length. `rev_val` will be a list of all the reversed strings from `operational_list` where the reversed string's length does not match the original string's length.
