Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a list of strings. If the length of the reversed and integer-converted first string (`x_rev`) is equal to the length of the original first string (`x`), then `rev_res` is incremented by `x_rev`. Otherwise, the reversed and integer-converted first string is appended to `rev_val`, and `rev_val` contains the reversed and integer-converted first string of `operational_list`.**
