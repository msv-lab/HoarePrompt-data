Postcondition: `x` is an integer, and `rev_res` is a string. If `x` is even (i.e., `x % 2 == 0`), then `x` is incremented by 1, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]`, and `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of `val_in` to it. If `x` is odd, then `x` remains 0, `val_in` is the value of `rev_val[0]`, and `rev_res` is the reverse of `rev_val[0]`.
