Output State: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements. After all iterations of the loop, `x` will be the last element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, and `x_rev` will be the integer representation of the reversed string of the last element of `operational_list`. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `x_rev` will be added to `rev_res`. Otherwise, `rev_val` will be a list containing the reversed integer of the last element of `operational_list`.

In this final state, `rev_res` will be the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the concatenation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]` (if `x` is even) or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x]` (if `x` is odd) for each iteration from `x = 0` to `x = len(rev_val) - 1`. The variable `y` remains 1.
