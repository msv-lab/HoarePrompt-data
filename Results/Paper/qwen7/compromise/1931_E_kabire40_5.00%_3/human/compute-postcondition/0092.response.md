Output State: **`rev_res` is now the concatenation of `rev_res` and the string representation of `val_in`; `rev_val` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]`.**

This means that `rev_res` has been updated by appending the string representation of `val_in` to its current value. The other variables (`rev_val`, `x`, and `val_in`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
