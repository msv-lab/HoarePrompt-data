Output State: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, `y` remains 1, and `rev_res` is updated by adding either the integer value of the current element in `rev_val` (if `x` is even) or the reverse of the current element in `rev_val` (if `x` is odd) to it, after all iterations of the loop have been executed.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `operational_list` remains unchanged, `rev_val` contains the sorted reversed integers of the reversed strings from `operational_list` that do not match their original lengths, `rev_res` is the cumulative sum of these reversed integers and possibly the last element of `operational_list` depending on its length, `y` stays as 1, and `rev_res` reflects the final accumulated value after processing each element in `rev_val` according to the given conditions.
