Postcondition: `rev_res` is the sum of the integers in `rev_val` with the additional value of either the integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `(x+1) % 2 == 0`) or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `(x+1) % 2 != 0`), `rev_val` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration, and `val_in` is assigned the integer value of `rev_val[x]` with each digit reversed if the condition `(x+1) % 2 != 0` is true, otherwise `val_in` is assigned the integer value of `rev_val[x]`.
