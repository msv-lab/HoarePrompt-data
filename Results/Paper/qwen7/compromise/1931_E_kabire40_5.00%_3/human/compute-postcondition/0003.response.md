Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `y` is 0, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts using the `split()` function and assigns them to `list_len` and `max_power`. Since the input is not specified, we keep `list_len` and `max_power` as strings. The values of `t`, `y`, and `rev_res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
