Output State: **`rev_val` is a sorted list of integers converted from the reversed strings of `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string does not match the original string's length.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.sort()` sorts the list `rev_val` in ascending order. Since sorting modifies the list in place, the original values in `rev_val` are replaced with their sorted versions. The other variables remain unchanged, so `operational_list` is still an empty list, and `rev_res` is still a string consisting of all the integers converted from the reversed strings of `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string matches the original string's length.
