Output State: **`rev_res` is the sum of the integers in `rev_val` with the additional value of either the integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `(x+1) % 2 == 0`) or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `(x+1) % 2 != 0`); `rev_val` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `val_in` is assigned the value of `int(rev_val[x])`.**

In natural language: `rev_res` remains unchanged as it is the sum of the integers in `rev_val` with the additional value specified. `rev_val` also remains unchanged. `x` is incremented by 1. A new variable `val_in` is created and assigned the integer value of `rev_val[x]`.
