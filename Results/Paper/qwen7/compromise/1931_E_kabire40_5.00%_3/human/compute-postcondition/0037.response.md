Output State: **`x` is 3; `rev_res` is a string updated by appending the string representation of `rev_val[3]` to it.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `rev_val[3]` to `val_in`. Since `x` is 3, `val_in` now holds the value of `rev_val[3]`. The value of `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of `val_in` to it. The value of `x` remains unchanged.
