Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Here are the issues:

1. **Space Calculation**: The variable `space_x` should be calculated as `x * 1` and `space_y` as `y * 4`, but this calculation is not used properly in determining the number of screens.

2. **Screen Requirement Calculation**: The logic to determine the number of screens needed is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `screen_require_for_y` and `remaining_cells` does not accurately reflect the space requirements for the 2x2 icons.

3. **Remaining Cells Handling**: The way `remaining_cells` is handled and the subsequent logic to determine additional screens is incorrect. It does not properly account for the placement of 1x1 icons within the remaining space.

4. **Final Screen Count**: The final count of screens (`extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`) is not correctly derived from the available space and the number of 2x2 icons.

To fix these issues, you need to correctly calculate the space required for both types of icons and ensure that the total space on the screens is utilized efficiently. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Total space required for 2x2 icons
        space_for_2x2 = y * 4
        # Total space available per screen
        space_per_screen = 5 * 3
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 3) // 4
        # Remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = space_per_screen * screens_for_2x2 - space_for_2x2
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space
        screens_for_1x1 = (x + remaining_space - 1) // remaining_space
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the space required for both types of icons is accurately calculated and the minimum number of screens needed is determined correctly.
