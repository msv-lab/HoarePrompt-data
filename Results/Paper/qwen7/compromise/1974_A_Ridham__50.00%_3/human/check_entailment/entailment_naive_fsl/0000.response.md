Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of screens required. Specifically, the calculation of `remaining_cells` and the subsequent logic for determining the number of additional screens needed are flawed. 

For example, consider the test case `(x, y) = (12, 4)`:
- According to the problem, we need to fit 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2.
- The total space required for 2x2 icons is `4 * 4 = 16` cells.
- The number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `4 // 2 + 1 = 3` (since 4 is odd, we need an additional screen).

However, the program calculates the remaining cells incorrectly and does not properly account for the placement of 1x1 icons. The correct approach would involve calculating how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

A correct approach would be to first calculate the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons and then check if the remaining space can accommodate the 1x1 icons. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons
        screen_require_for_y = (y + 1) // 2
        # Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 1x1 icons
        extra_screens_for_x = (x + remaining_cells - 1) // remaining_cells
        result.append(screen_require_for_y + extra_screens_for_x)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of screens required is calculated accurately based on the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
