Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) followed by pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it returns a specific output based on the values of `x` and `y`.**

Given the constraints and the lack of direct parameter definition within the function signature, the function likely iterates over a series of test cases, each containing `t`, `x`, and `y`, and processes them according to some logic. However, based solely on the provided information, the exact nature of the processing and the return value for each test case is not specified.
