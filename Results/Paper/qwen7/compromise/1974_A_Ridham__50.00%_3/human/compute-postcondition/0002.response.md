Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable here is `_`, but since `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable (it is not used within the loop body), we don't need to consider it for adjustment. The key variable here is `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: The state before the loop starts mentions that `n` is an input integer. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer because `range(n)` will not produce any values if `n` is negative.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since `n` must be a non-negative integer for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 0. Additionally, since the problem specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), this information about `t` does not affect the condition for the loop to execute based on `n`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `n` must be a non-negative integer.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be a non-negative integer, `result` is an empty list**
