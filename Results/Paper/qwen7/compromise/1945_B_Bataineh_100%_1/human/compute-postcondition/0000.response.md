Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 is maintained, and now `t` holds the specific value entered by the user.
