Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The logic in the `if-elif-else` block is flawed and does not account for all possible scenarios where the maximum number of fireworks could be seen.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. The maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time would then be the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the LCM interval plus one additional pair of fireworks launched at the beginning.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)  # Calculate LCM of a and b
        max_visible = (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm_ab) + 1  # Formula to calculate max visible fireworks
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected function uses the least common multiple (LCM) to ensure the correct calculation of the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
