Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` is an integer representing the number of cards in each player's hand, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. `a` is a list of n integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice in the list. `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

The code replaces the default input function with `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input from standard input as a single string. However, it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
