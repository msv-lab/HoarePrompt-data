Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by optimally choosing your moves, given the constraints of the game.
   - The function uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs of integers in the list `a` (where each integer appears exactly twice).
   - Finally, it returns the minimum value between the number of such pairs and `n // 2`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a`, and calls `func_1(n, a)`.
   - It collects the results for all test cases and prints them.

### Analysis:
- **Problem Description:**
  - The game involves two players, you and Nene, who take turns selecting cards.
  - Nene always chooses optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.
  - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get by making optimal choices.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly identifies pairs of integers in the list `a` and ensures that you do not score more than `n // 2` points, which aligns with the problem's requirement that Nene will play optimally to minimize your score.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The function correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` appropriately.
  - It handles multiple test cases and prints the results correctly.

Given that both functions correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
