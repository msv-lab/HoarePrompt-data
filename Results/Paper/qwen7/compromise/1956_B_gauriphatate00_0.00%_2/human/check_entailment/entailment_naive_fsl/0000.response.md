Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game dynamics as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for Nene's optimal strategy of maximizing her score while minimizing yours. Instead, it simply calculates the minimum number of pairs of cards in your hand and assumes that you can get half of those pairs. This approach does not consider Nene's strategic moves to block your points.

To illustrate this, let's consider a specific case:

### Test Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  4
  1 1 2 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  1
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  0
  ```

In this case, the correct strategy would be:
1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table.
2. Nene will then select the other card with an integer 1, blocking your point.
3. You select the card with an integer 2 and place it on the table.
4. Nene will then select the card with an integer 2, scoring 1 point.
5. You select the card with an integer 3 and place it on the table.
6. Nene will then select the card with an integer 3, scoring 1 point.

Thus, you can get 1 point, but the current implementation incorrectly returns 0.

Therefore, the program does not handle the optimal strategy of Nene correctly and hence is incorrect.
