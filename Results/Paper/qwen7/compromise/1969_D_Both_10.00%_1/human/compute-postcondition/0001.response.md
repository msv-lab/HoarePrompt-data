State: **`sub_summ` is 0, `val_a` must be initialized and `sec_arr` must have at least one element**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `val_a`, which is used in the loop.
2. The loop also depends on the existence of the list `sec_arr`.
3. For the loop to execute, `sec_arr` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `sec_arr`.
4. The variable `sub_summ` is not directly involved in the loop condition or iteration, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `val_a` (which must be initialized to the first element of `sec_arr` for the loop to start) and `sec_arr` (which must have at least one element).
