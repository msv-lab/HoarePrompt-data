Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers. Both lists have the same length. It calculates and returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of the first element of each tuple in `main_ar` plus the second element of the tuple, but only if their sum is greater than or equal to zero.**
