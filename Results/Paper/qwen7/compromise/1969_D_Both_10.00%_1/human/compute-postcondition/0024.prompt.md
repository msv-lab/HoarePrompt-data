Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, where each element is accessed using `val_a[0]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `sub_summ` will contain the sum of the first element (`val_a[0]`) from each sublist in `sec_arr`. The condition for the loop to execute all iterations is that `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are iterations, which in this case is the total number of sublists in `sec_arr`.
Code of the loop:
for val_b in main_ar:
    if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
        sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` is a list containing sublists, and `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are sublists in `main_ar`, `val_b` is the first element of each sublist in `main_ar`. If the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is updated to include the value of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`. If the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]` is less than 0, `sub_summ` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` is a list containing sublists with one less element, `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are sublists in `main_ar`, and `val_b` is the first element of the next sublist in `main_ar`. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is updated to include the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` is a list containing sublists with one less element, `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are sublists in `main_ar`, and `val_b` is the first element of the next sublist in `main_ar`. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is updated to include the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
