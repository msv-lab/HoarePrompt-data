Postcondition: `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, where each element is accessed using `val_a[0]`, `main_ar` is a list containing sublists, and `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are sublists in `main_ar`, `val_b` is the first element of each sublist in `main_ar`, and the current value of `val_b[0]` plus `val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0.
