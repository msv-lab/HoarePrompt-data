Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `sub_summ` is 0 + `val_a[0]`
- `val_a` must be initialized
- `sec_arr` must have at least one element

### Loop Head:
```python
for val_a in sec_arr:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `val_a` is being assigned from `sec_arr`.
2. **Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `sec_arr` has at least one element.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first element of `val_a` (which is `val_a[0]`), `val_a` must be initialized, and `sec_arr` must have at least one element.
2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `sec_arr` must still have at least one element. Since `val_a` is being assigned from `sec_arr`, `val_a` itself will change in each iteration, but the condition for the loop to continue is based on `sec_arr`.

### Adjusted State:
- `sub_summ` will be updated to include the next element of `val_a` if `sec_arr` has more elements.
- `val_a` will be the next element from `sec_arr`.
- `sec_arr` must still have at least one element for the loop to execute again.

### Final Answer:
State: **`sub_summ` is 0 + `val_a[0]` + `val_a[1]`, `val_a` must be initialized, `sec_arr` must have at least two elements**

This means that `sub_summ` now includes the sum of the first two elements of `val_a`, and `sec_arr` must still have at least two elements for the loop to execute one more time.
