Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `odds`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `odds` and `x` is set to the current element of the list.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `prev` is equal to `x`.
   - `x` is the first element of the list `odds`.
   - `idx` is decremented by 1.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the first element of the list `odds`, after the loop runs once, `x` will be set to the second element of the list `odds`.
   - `idx` was decremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, so it needs to be decremented again for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `prev` remains the same because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `x` changes to the second element of the list `odds`.
   - `idx` is decremented by 1 again.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`prev` is equal to `x`, `x` is the second element of the list `odds`, `idx` is decremented by 1**.
