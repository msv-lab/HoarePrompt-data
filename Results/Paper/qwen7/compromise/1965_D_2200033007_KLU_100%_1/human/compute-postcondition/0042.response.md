Output State: `i` must be less than `len(a)`, `j` is `i + (len(a) - i - 1)`, `sm` is the cumulative sum of all elements in list `a` from index `i` to the end, `cts` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `sm` for each iteration of the loop from `i` to `len(a) - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to or greater than `len(a)`, meaning the condition `i < len(a)` will no longer be true. The variable `j` will be the last index of the list `a`. The variable `sm` will hold the sum of all elements in the list `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list. The list `cts` will contain the cumulative sums of `sm` at each step of the loop, starting from the first element added to `sm` up to the last element.
