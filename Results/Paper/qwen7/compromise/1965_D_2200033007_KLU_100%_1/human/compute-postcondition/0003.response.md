Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

2. **Current State**: 
   - `bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed.
   - `smallList` is a list of integers with the last element removed.
   - `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be true:
   - `len(smallList) > 0`: This means `smallList` must have at least one element.
   - `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`: The last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` must be equal.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `bigList` and `smallList` both have their last elements checked, we need to ensure that `smallList` has at least one element and that the last elements of both lists are still equal.
   - We don't need to change `bigList` because the condition `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` already holds true based on the current state.

5. **Final State**:
   - `smallList` must have at least one element.
   - `bigList[-1]` should still be equal to `smallList[-1]`.

Therefore, the final state after adjusting the necessary variables for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `smallList` must have at least one element, and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**.
