Output State: **`prev` is equal to the third element of the list `odds`, `x` is the third element of the list `odds`, `idx` is decremented by 1, `a[idx]` is equal to `x`**.

Explanation: The code `a[idx] = x` assigns the value of `x` to the index `idx` in the list `a`. Since `x` is the third element of the list `odds`, `a[idx]` is now equal to `x`. The values of `prev` and `x` remain unchanged, and `idx` is decremented by 1.
