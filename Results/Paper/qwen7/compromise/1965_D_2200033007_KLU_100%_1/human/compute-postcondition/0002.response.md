Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `smallList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` before the pop operation, after the operation, this equality still holds true. The initial conditions about `bigList` and `smallList` remain valid except for the fact that both lists now have their last elements removed.
