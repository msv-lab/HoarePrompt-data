### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to generate a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`.
   - The string `s` should have the smallest possible length among all valid solutions.
   - If there are multiple valid strings of the same length, any one of them can be printed.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then prints a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times.

3. **Checking the Solution's Validity:**
   - The solution provided in the program is:
     ```python
     print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
     ```
   - This approach generates a string that repeats the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times.

4. **Checking the Solution Against Test Cases:**
   - For `n=1` and `k=2`, the output is "ab". This is correct because both 'a' and 'b' are subsequences of "ab".
   - For `n=2` and `k=1`, the output is "aa". This is correct because the only possible string of length 2 using the first 1 alphabet ('a') is "aa", and it is a subsequence of "aa".
   - For `n=2` and `k=2`, the output is "baab". This is incorrect because "baab" does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 2 alphabets ('a' and 'b'). For example, "ab" is not a subsequence of "baab".
   - For `n=2` and `k=3`, the output is "abcbac". This is incorrect because "abcbac" does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c'). For example, "ab" is not a subsequence of "abcbac".

5. **Ensuring Correctness:**
   - The solution does not guarantee that the generated string will contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
   - Repeating the first `k` alphabets `n` times does not necessarily cover all possible subsequences of length `n`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution fails to handle cases where the generated string does not contain all required subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The solution provided does not ensure that the generated string contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.

**Final: False**
