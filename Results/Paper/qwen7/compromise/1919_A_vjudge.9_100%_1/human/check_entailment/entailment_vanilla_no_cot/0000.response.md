Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game rules. According to the game rules, the player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet. The solution only checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly. This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal moves for each player.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of coins each player has. Hereâ€™s a correct approach:

1. If both `a` and `b` are even or both are odd, the player whose turn it is will lose because they will eventually be forced to make a move where they have 0 coins in their wallet.
2. If one of `a` or `b` is even and the other is odd, the player whose turn it is will win because they can always force the opponent into a losing position.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if (a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0) or (a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0):
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This code correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of coins each player has.
