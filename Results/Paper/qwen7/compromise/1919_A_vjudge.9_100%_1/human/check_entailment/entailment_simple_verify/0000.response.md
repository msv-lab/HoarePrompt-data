### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from their own wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- The goal is to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively.
- It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- If the absolute difference is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Game Logic**: The game's outcome depends on the optimal strategy, which is not simply based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`. Instead, it involves forcing the opponent into a losing position.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: The key insight is that if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by mirroring Bob's moves. Conversely, if the absolute difference is odd, Bob can mirror Alice's moves and force Alice into a losing position.
3. **Parity Check**: The provided program correctly identifies the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`. However, the logic needs to be interpreted in the context of the optimal strategy.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly identifies the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`.
- Based on the parity check, it correctly determines the winner according to the optimal strategy described in the problem analysis.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for determining the winner based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the optimal strategy for determining the winner based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have.
