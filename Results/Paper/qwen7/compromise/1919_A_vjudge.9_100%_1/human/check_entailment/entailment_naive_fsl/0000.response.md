Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly determines the winner based on the absolute difference between `a` and `b` being even or odd. However, the actual winning condition depends on whether the player can force the opponent into a losing position, not just the parity of the difference.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `5 3`

According to the problem description, the game proceeds as follows:
1. Alice starts with 5 coins and Bob with 3 coins.
2. Alice can either swap wallets or not. If she swaps, she gets 3 coins and Bob gets 5 coins.
3. Now, Bob has 5 coins and Alice has 3 coins. Bob can either swap or not. If he swaps, he gets 3 coins and Alice gets 5 coins.
4. This process continues until one player cannot make a valid move.

In this specific case, the correct outcome should be determined by the optimal strategy rather than just the parity of the difference. The provided solution fails to account for the strategic aspect of the game, leading to incorrect results for many inputs.
