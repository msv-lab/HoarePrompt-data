Output State: The output state will consist of "Bob" printed for each iteration where the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, and "Alice" printed for each iteration where the absolute difference is odd. Since the initial state only defines `t` (an integer between 1 and 1000), the exact output cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `a` and `b` for each iteration.
