Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the output state reflects that `t` now holds the input integer within this range.
