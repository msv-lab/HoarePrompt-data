Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions, extracts the positions of goals, players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger, and maps players to their initial coordinates.
   
2. **Game Steps Execution**:
   - The program iterates through each step of the game, handling actions such as movement, catching the Quaffle, and throwing the Quaffle.
   - For each action, the program updates the positions of the players and the Quaffle appropriately.
   - The logic for scoring points when a player successfully throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal is correctly implemented.
   - The logic for eliminating a player when they are hit by a Bludger is also correctly implemented.
   - The program prints the appropriate events (scoring, elimination) in the correct order and format.

3. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - After processing all steps, the program correctly calculates and prints the final score.

4. **Functions**:
   - `func_1` correctly updates the position of an object (player or Bludger) based on the direction of movement.
   - `func_2` correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as a Bludger and prints the elimination event.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly based on the provided problem description and the execution states of the program.

Correctness: **True**
