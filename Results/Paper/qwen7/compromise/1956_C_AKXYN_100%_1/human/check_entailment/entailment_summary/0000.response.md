Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
2. The given program initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` with values ranging from 1 to \( n \) for each row, which ensures that the sum of the matrix is maximized because each cell contains the highest possible value for its position.
3. The sum `res` calculated using the formula \((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)\) is not directly relevant to the problem's requirements but seems to be a placeholder or a misinterpretation of the actual goal.
4. The program prints the sum of the matrix (which is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times, i.e., \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \)) and \( 2n \), which is within the allowed limit of operations.
5. The subsequent operations are correctly defined as Type 1 and Type 2 operations, setting each row and column to the sequence from 1 to \( n \), ensuring that every element in the matrix is set to its maximum possible value.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix and adheres to the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
