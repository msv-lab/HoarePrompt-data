### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each element \( a_{i,j} \) in the matrix can be set to any value from 1 to \( n \).
   - Two types of operations are allowed:
     - Type 1: Permute the elements in a specific row.
     - Type 2: Permute the elements in a specific column.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution initializes the matrix `mat` with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row.
   - It calculates the sum of the matrix elements and prints the result along with the number of operations required.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, setting each row and column to the sequence from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Checking the Correctness:**
   - The sum of the matrix after initializing it with the sequence from 1 to \( n \) in each row is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i \times n) = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).
   - This is indeed the maximum possible sum because each element can be at most \( n \).
   - The solution uses exactly \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) correctly by setting the single element to 1.
   - For \( n > 1 \), the solution sets each row and column to the sequence from 1 to \( n \), which is a valid permutation and maximizes the sum.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the actual implementation, there is a discrepancy. The matrix `mat` is initialized correctly, but the operations performed do not necessarily achieve the maximum sum as intended.

- **Matrix Initialization:**
  ```python
  mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
  ```
  This initializes the matrix with each row containing the sequence from 1 to \( n \).

- **Operations:**
  ```python
  for i in range(n, 0, -1):
      print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
      print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
  ```
  Here, the operations are printing the same permutation for each row and column, which does not change the matrix since the sequence from 1 to \( n \) is already present in each row and column.

### Conclusion:
The given solution does not actually perform any meaningful operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. The matrix is already initialized with the optimal values, and the operations simply repeat the initialization without changing anything.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The program does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the matrix as required by the problem statement.
