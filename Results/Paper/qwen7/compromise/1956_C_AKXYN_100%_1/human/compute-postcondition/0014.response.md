Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is explicitly given as 204.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the components of the `print` statement:

1. `'1 %d' % i`: This part formats the string to include the value of `i` after the number 1. For example, if `i` is 3, it would become `'1 3'`.

2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n + 1` into separate arguments for the `print` function. For example, if `n` is 5, it would expand to `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

Given these details, the `print` statement will output a string that starts with '1' followed by the value of `i` and then all numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Since the exact values of `i` and `n` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **'1 [i]' followed by space-separated numbers from 1 to [n]**
