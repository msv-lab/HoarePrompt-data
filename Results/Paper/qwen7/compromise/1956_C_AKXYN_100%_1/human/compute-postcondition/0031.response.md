Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(n)` statement. This means the loop variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `res` is 6.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same or be greater than 3 (since `i` is now 3).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
**`res` is 6, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3**.
