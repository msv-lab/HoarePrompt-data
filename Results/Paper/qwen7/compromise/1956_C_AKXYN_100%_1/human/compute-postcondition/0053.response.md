Output State: **`res` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.**

Explanation: The initial value of `res` is 0. The code `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` increments `res` by the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the expression evaluates to `(0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1) = 1 * 1 = 1`. Thus, `res` is updated to `0 + 1 = 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `mat` remain unchanged.
