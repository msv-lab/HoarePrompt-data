Output State: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 6, `i` is 0, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 6.

After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will decrement from 5 to 0. The loop modifies `i` in each iteration by decrementing it by 1. Since the loop runs from `i = 5` down to `i = 0`, after all iterations are complete, `i` will be 0. The value of `res` remains 204 as it is not modified further after `i` reaches 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `mat`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
