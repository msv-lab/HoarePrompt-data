Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `res` is explicitly given as 204.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). Since no specific value is provided, it remains as a range.
   - `n` is explicitly given as 6.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 6. However, the exact content of `mat` is not relevant to the print statement.

2. **Print statement analysis:**
   - The print statement is: `'2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1)`
   - `'2 %d' % i`: This part of the print statement uses string formatting. `%d` is a placeholder for an integer, and `i` is 3. So, this part becomes `'2 3'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into separate arguments. Given `n` is 6, `range(1, 7)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

3. **Combining the parts:**
   - The print statement combines the formatted string `'2 3'` with the unpacked range values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
   - Therefore, the print statement will output: `'2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6'`.

Output: **2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6**
