Given the initial state:
- `res` is 204
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n-1`

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the print statement:
1. `'1 %d' % i`: This part of the string will be formatted to include the value of `i`. Since `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n-1`, let's denote it as `i`.
2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual arguments and prints them separated by spaces.

Since the exact values of `i` and `n` are not specified, we'll represent them symbolically.

The output will be a string starting with `1` followed by the value of `i` and then all numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 [i] 1 2 ... n-1 n** (where `[i]` represents the value of `i` and `n` represents the value of `n`)
