Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `res` is 204
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` is 6
   - `i` is 4
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 6

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n` down to 0 (exclusive) with a step of -1. This means the loop will run for values of `i` starting from 6 and decreasing by 1 until `i` is 1.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` was 4 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be 3 (decremented by 1).

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` will be 3 in the next iteration, the loop will continue.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust these variables. The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop. The value of `i` decreases by 1.

7. **Final state**: After adjusting the state, the new state will be:
   - `res` is 204 (unchanged)
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) (unchanged)
   - `n` is 6 (unchanged)
   - `i` is 3 (decreased by 1)
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 6 (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 6, `i` is 3, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to 6**
