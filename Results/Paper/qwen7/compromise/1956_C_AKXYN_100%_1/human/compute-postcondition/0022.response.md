Output State: `res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be exactly 1, `i` must be 0.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = n` down to `i = 1`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `i` must now be 0, meaning `n` must have been reduced to 1 over the course of the loop's iterations. Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration and starts with `i` being 499 initially (as per the initial state), it would take 499 iterations to reach `i = 0` starting from `i = 499`. However, the problem specifies that the loop has only executed 3 times, which implies that `n` was set to 1 in the first iteration itself, making the loop terminate immediately thereafter. Therefore, `n` remains 1, and `i` is 0 after all iterations. The values of `res` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
