Output State: **`res` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` sets the value of `res` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `mat`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
