Output State: **`res` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0. No changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `mat`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
