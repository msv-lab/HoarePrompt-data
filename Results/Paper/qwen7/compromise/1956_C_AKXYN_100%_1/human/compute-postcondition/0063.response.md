Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is 204.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). The value of `t` is not explicitly given, but it does not affect the print statement.
   - `n` is 6.
   - `i` is 5.
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`. Since `n` is 6, each sublist in `mat` will contain the integers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

   - `'2 %d' % i`: This part of the print statement formats the string. Here, `i` is 5, so it will replace `%d` with 5. Therefore, this part becomes `'2 5'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range function into separate arguments. Since `n` is 6, `range(1, n + 1)` generates the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. The `*` operator then passes these values as separate arguments to the print function.

Combining these parts, the print statement will output the string `'2 5'` followed by the numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.

Output: **2 5 1 2 3 4 5 6**
