State: **`res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 6, `i` is 5, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **Identify Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine Initial Values**: From the given state, `i` is 5 and `n` is 6.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i` in the range `range(n, 0, -1)`, meaning `i` will decrement from 6 to 1.
4. **Effect of Loop on `res`**: The loop body adds `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to `res` in each iteration. Given that `res` is already 204, we need to ensure that the loop completes its iterations correctly without altering `res` beyond 204.
5. **Check Loop Iterations**:
   - For `i = 5`: \((5 + 1) * (2 * 5 + 1) = 6 * 11 = 66\)
   - For `i = 4`: \((4 + 1) * (2 * 4 + 1) = 5 * 9 = 45\)
   - For `i = 3`: \((3 + 1) * (2 * 3 + 1) = 4 * 7 = 28\)
   - For `i = 2`: \((2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15\)
   - For `i = 1`: \((1 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) = 2 * 3 = 6\)

6. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Initial `res` = 204
   - Adding terms: \(204 + 66 + 45 + 28 + 15 + 6 = 204 + 160 = 364\) (This exceeds 204, so we need to verify the exact state).

Given the problem constraints and the calculation, the only feasible state that ensures the loop executes correctly and `res` remains 204 is when the loop has completed its iterations up to `i = 5`.

Therefore, the final state is:
**`res` is 204, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is 6, `i` is 5, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`**.
