Output State: **res is 140, t is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), n is 7, i is 0.**

After all the iterations of the loop, the value of `res` remains 140 because the loop only adds to `res` based on the formula \((i+1)(2i+1)\) and `i` decreases from `n` to 0. The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `n` remains 7 as it was not modified inside the loop. Finally, `i` becomes 0 after the last iteration of the loop.
