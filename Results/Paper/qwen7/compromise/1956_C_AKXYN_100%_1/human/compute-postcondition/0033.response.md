Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 4 (since `i` is now 4).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`res` is 24, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4**
