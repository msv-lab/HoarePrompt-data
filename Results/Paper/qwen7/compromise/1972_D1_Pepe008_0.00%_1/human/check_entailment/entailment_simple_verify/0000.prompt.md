You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed for all values of `t` from 0 to `T-1`. Therefore, `t` will be equal to `T-1`. The variable `T` remains as the initial positive integer provided. The variable `info` remains unchanged, holding the list of strings split from the input. The variable `a` remains as the first element of `info` converted to an integer. The variable `b` remains as the second element of `info` converted to an integer. The variable `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop's iterations for each `t` from 0 to `T-1`, where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for all `i` in the range 1 to `b`. After all iterations, `suma` will be printed, followed by `suma - 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the formula used in the loop to calculate `x` does not accurately determine the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

To illustrate, consider the test case `(n, m) = (10, 8)`. According to the problem statement, we need to find pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 \le a \le n`, `1 \le b \le m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`.

The provided program uses the formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to calculate the number of valid pairs for each `b = i`. However, this formula does not correctly account for the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)`.

For example, let's manually check some pairs for `n = 10` and `m = 8`:
- For `b = 1`, valid pairs include `(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1)`, which gives 10 pairs.
- For `b = 2`, valid pairs include `(2, 2), (4, 2), (6, 2), (8, 2)`, which gives 4 pairs.
- For `b = 3`, valid pairs include `(3, 3), (6, 3), (9, 3)`, which gives 3 pairs.
- For `b = 4`, valid pairs include `(4, 4), (8, 4)`, which gives 2 pairs.
- For `b = 5`, valid pairs include `(5, 5)`, which gives 1 pair.
- For `b = 6`, valid pairs include `(6, 6)`, which gives 1 pair.
- For `b = 7`, valid pairs include `(7, 7)`, which gives 1 pair.
- For `b = 8`, valid pairs include `(8, 8)`, which gives 1 pair.

Summing these up, we get 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 14 valid pairs, which matches the expected output.

However, the provided program outputs 14 for this test case, but it fails to correctly handle other cases as well. For instance, for the test case `(n, m) = (100, 1233)`, the program outputs 153, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 153 after properly implementing the logic.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
