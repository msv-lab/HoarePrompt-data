Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Inner Loop Boundaries**: The inner loop should iterate over values of `b` and check the condition for each pair `(a, b)`. However, the current implementation iterates over `i` up to `a` and `j` up to `4`, which is incorrect and unrelated to the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:` is commented out and not used in the actual code. Instead, the program uses a different formula that does not correctly implement the required condition.

3. **Formula Used**: The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is not derived from the problem statement and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges and check if they satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition directly, ensuring correctness according to the problem statement.
