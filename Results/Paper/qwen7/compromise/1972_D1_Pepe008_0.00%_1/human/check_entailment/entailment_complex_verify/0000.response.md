### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and calculates \(x\) using the formula:
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]
where \(i\) ranges from 1 to \(b\).

This formula is intended to count the number of valid \(a\) values for each fixed \(b\). However, the formula is incorrect because it does not properly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here's a corrected approach:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The function `count_valid_pairs` iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count.
- The main function `func` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `count_valid_pairs`.

#### Comparison with Original Code:
- The original code attempts to use a different formula to count valid pairs, which is incorrect.
- The corrected code directly checks the condition for each pair, ensuring accuracy.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
