Output State: **`suma` is increased by `x`, and `x` is equal to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `suma += x` increments the value of `suma` by the current value of `x`. The value of `x` is defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state includes the updated value of `suma` and the specific formula for `x`.
