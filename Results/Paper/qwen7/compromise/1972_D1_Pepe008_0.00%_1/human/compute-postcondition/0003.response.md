Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first and second elements of the `info` list (which is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input string) to variables `a` and `b`, respectively. These elements are converted to integers using the `int()` function. The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged.
