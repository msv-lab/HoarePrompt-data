Output State: **The value of `t` remains 0, `T` remains as the initial positive integer, `info` remains unchanged, `a` remains as the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` remains as the second element of `info` converted to an integer, and `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop's iterations until `a - i * (i - 1) <= 0` for all `i` in the range 1 to `b`.**

In this final state, `t` and `T` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop. The `info` list also remains unchanged as it is not altered by the loop. The variable `a` stays the same as it is derived from `info` and not modified inside the loop. The variable `b` remains constant as it is the upper limit of the loop's range. The variable `suma` accumulates the value of `x` for each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, and once `a - i * (i - 1) <= 0`, no further additions occur to `suma`.
