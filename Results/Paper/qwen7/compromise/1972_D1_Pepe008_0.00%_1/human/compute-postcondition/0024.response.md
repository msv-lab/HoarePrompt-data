Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `t` and `T`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `t` is less than `T`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` remains 0
   - `T` remains as the initial positive integer
   - `info` remains unchanged
   - `a` remains as the first element of `info` converted to an integer
   - `b` remains as the second element of `info` converted to an integer
   - `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop's iterations until `a - i * (i - 1) <= 0` for all `i` in the range 1 to `b`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `t < T`, we need to increment `t` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `T` remains unchanged.
   - `info`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop body.
   - `suma` remains unchanged because it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is 1, `T` remains as the initial positive integer, `info` remains unchanged, `a` remains as the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` remains as the second element of `info` converted to an integer, and `suma` remains the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop's iterations until `a - i * (i - 1) <= 0` for all `i` in the range 1 to `b`.**
