Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `info`. The variable `t` remains unchanged with its value as 0, and `T` retains its original state as a positive integer within the specified range.
