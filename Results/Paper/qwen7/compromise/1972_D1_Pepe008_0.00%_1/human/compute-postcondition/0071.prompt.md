Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    """for i in range(1,a+1):
        for j in range(4,b+1):
            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:
                print(i,j)"""
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
            suma += x
    print(suma - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The value of `t` remains 0, `T` remains as the initial positive integer, `info` remains unchanged, `a` remains as the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` remains as the second element of `info` converted to an integer, and `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop's iterations until `a - i * (i - 1) <= 0` for all `i` in the range 1 to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` remains as 1, `T` remains as the initial positive integer, `info` remains as the list of strings split from the input, `a` remains as the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` remains as the second element of `info` converted to an integer, `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is equal to b, suma is the sum of integers starting from 2 up to the value of x in the last iteration of the loop, and all conditions for the loop to execute must hold true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
