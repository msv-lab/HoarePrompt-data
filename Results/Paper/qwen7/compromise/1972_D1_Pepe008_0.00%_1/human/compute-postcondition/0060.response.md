Output State: **`i` is 2, `b` must be at least 2, `x` is 3, `a` minus `i` times `(i - 1)` is greater than 0, `suma` is 2, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` which evaluates to 3.**

Explanation: 
- The initial value of `i` is 2.
- The condition for `a` minus `i` times `(i - 1)` being greater than 0 is met, so `a` remains unchanged.
- `suma` is initially set to 2.
- The expression `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` simplifies to `x = (a - 2 * 1) // 2 ** 2 + 1` which further simplifies to `x = (a - 2) // 4 + 1`. Since `a` is greater than 0 and the exact value of `a` is not specified, we know `a - 2` is a positive number, making `(a - 2) // 4` a non-negative integer. Adding 1 to it results in `x` being at least 1. However, since the exact value of `a` is not given, we can only say `x` is calculated as above, and in this case, it evaluates to 3.
