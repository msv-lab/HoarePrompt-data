### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts.
   - The cost can be calculated either at the regular price (`a` per yogurt) or at the promotional price (`b` for two yogurts).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then checks if the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the regular price (`2*a`).
     - If `2*a > b`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at `a` burles.
     - If `2*a <= b`, it means it's cheaper to use the promotion.
       - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, it calculates the total cost as `(A/2) * b`.
       - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost as `(A//2) * b + a`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for checking the promotional price (`2*a > b`) is correct.
   - However, the logic for handling even and odd numbers of yogurts has a flaw:
     - If `A` is even, the current logic correctly calculates the total cost as `(A/2) * b`.
     - If `A` is odd, the current logic correctly buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt at the regular price. However, the calculation for the remaining yogurt is incorrect. The correct formula should be `(A // 2) * b + a` instead of `(A // 2) * b + B`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the edge case where `A` is odd correctly. Specifically, the variable `B` should be `a` (the regular price) instead of `B` (which is the same as `b` in this context).

5. **Output:**
   - The output does not match the expected results for some test cases. For example, in the third test case of the example, the correct output should be `15` (since `3 * 5 = 15`), but the program incorrectly calculates it as `14` due to the mistake in the formula.

### Conclusion:
The given program has a logical error in the calculation for the case when the number of yogurts `A` is odd. This error leads to incorrect results for certain test cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The final evaluation is **False** because the program does not correctly handle the case when the number of yogurts is odd, leading to incorrect results.
