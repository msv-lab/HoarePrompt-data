Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts with the given prices. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Price Comparison**: For each test case, it compares the regular price of two yogurts (`B * 2`) with the promotional price (`C`). If the promotional price is cheaper, it suggests buying all yogurts in pairs.
3. **Even Number of Yogurts**: If the number of yogurts (`A`) is even, it calculates the total cost by dividing the number of yogurts by 2 and multiplying by the promotional price (`C`).
4. **Odd Number of Yogurts**: If the number of yogurts is odd, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible using the promotional price and then adding the cost of the remaining yogurt at the regular price (`B`).

The solution handles all edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.
