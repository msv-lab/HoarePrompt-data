Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `int(num)` is the value of `num`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `list2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `list2` as an empty list. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of all variables except for the addition of `list2` being an empty list.
