Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for numbers in range(int(num))`. The key variables here are `numbers` and `int(num)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `numbers` is the variable that will iterate through the range.
   - `int(num)` is the upper limit of the range, which is derived from the value of `num`.

3. **Initial state before the loop**:
   - `out` is an empty list.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
   - `num` is an input integer.
   - The numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}\) where 1 ≤ \(a_i\) ≤ \(10^7\).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to start, `numbers` must be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the range).
   - `int(num)` should be set to the actual value of `num` to define the range.

Given this, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `numbers` should be set to 0.
- `int(num)` should be set to the value of `num`.

Therefore, the modified state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `int(num)` is the value of `num`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n}\) where 1 ≤ \(a_i\) ≤ \(10^7\)**.
