Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `list2` contains the integer value of the element at index 2 * i from `list1`**.

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of the element at index `2 * i` from `list1` to `list2`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `2 * i` is 0. Therefore, `list2` now contains the integer value of `list1[0]`. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
