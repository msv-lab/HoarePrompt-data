Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers a, b, and m, where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (t being the number of test cases). It returns different values based on the relationship between a, b, and m for each test case.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases, each containing three integers a, b, and m, and returns specific values based on their relationships, with t indicating the number of such test cases.
