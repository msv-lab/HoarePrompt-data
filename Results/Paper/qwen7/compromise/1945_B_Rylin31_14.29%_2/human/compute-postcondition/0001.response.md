State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2. The loop condition `i in range(t)` means that the loop will run `t` times if `t` is a positive integer.
3. Since `t` is an input integer and the loop depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is a valid positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
4. Initially, `i` is set to 0, as the loop starts with the first iteration where `i` is 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is a valid positive integer within the given range and `i` is initialized to 0.
