Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` will still satisfy this condition, and it will also be the integer input provided by the user.
