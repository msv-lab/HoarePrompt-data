Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.
3. It calculates `mn` as the sum of the minimum of `a` and `b` and `m`.
4. The logic for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is as follows:
   - If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is `1`, the formula used is `(mn // a) + (mn // b) + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the formula used is `(mn // a) + (mn // b)`.

This logic is based on the fact that the number of fireworks visible at any given time is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, but since `m` is added to account for the visibility duration, the formula adjusts accordingly.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **True**
