Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array `a` and sets `cnt` to 0 to count consecutive occurrences of `tmp`.
4. It iterates through the array `a` and updates `cnt` whenever it encounters the same value as `tmp`. When a different value is encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
5. After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final value of `cnt`.
6. It checks if the array has only one element or if the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` is equal to `n`. If either condition is true, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function appears to follow the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly identifies the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful or outputs `-1` if it is impossible to do so.

Correctness: **True**
