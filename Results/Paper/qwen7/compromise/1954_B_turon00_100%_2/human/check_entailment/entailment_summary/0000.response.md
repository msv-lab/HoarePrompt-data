Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and counting consecutive occurrences of the first element. However, this approach does not correctly determine whether the array can become non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. The logic in the program is flawed because:

1. The program only counts consecutive occurrences of the first element, which does not necessarily reflect the structure of the array needed to determine if it can become non-beautiful.
2. The program does not consider the condition where removing elements can break the pattern required to keep the array beautiful.
3. The program does not implement the actual logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
