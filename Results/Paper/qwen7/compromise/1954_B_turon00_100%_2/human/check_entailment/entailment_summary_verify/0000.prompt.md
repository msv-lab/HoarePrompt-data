You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        tmp = a[0]
        cnt = 0
        ans = n
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        if n == 1 or ans == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `t`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it finds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the array `a`. If the array has only one element or the minimum count is equal to `n`, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the minimum count. After processing all test cases, it ensures that `t` is decremented to 0 and all other variables are in their expected final states.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the requirement to remove the minimum number of elements to make the array stop being beautiful. Instead, it seems to be counting the maximum consecutive elements that are the same, which does not solve the problem as described.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
4
3
2 2 2
5
1 2 1 2 1
1
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
-1
1
-1
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
-1
3
-1
3
```

The program incorrectly counts the number of consecutive identical elements and uses this to determine the answer, which does not align with the problem's requirements. For example, in the second test case, the program outputs `3` instead of `1`, because it counts the maximum number of consecutive identical elements (which is `3`), but the correct answer should be `1` since removing the element at index `5` (value `1`) makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
