You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0, `i` will be `3 * n`, `tmp` will be equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` will hold the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution across all inputs, `n` will remain unchanged for each individual input but will be processed sequentially, and either `n == 1 or ans == n` is satisfied for each input, or `i` will be greater than or equal to the length of the list `a` for each input.
    #
    #This means that after processing all `t` inputs, the counter `t` will have been decremented to 0, and for each input, the loop will have fully processed the list `a` up to `3 * n` (considering the summation effect of incrementing `i` by `n` for each input), with `tmp` holding the first element of the list for the current input, `ans` containing the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` for that input, and the conditions for printing `-1` or the result will have been evaluated and printed as necessary.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to 0. `ans` is set to `n` initially.
   - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`. When a different element is encountered, it updates `ans` with the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with `cnt`.
   - If `n == 1` or `ans == n`, it prints `-1` (indicating the array cannot be made non-beautiful).
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

3. **Checking Correctness**:
   - The logic for counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp` seems correct. This approach correctly identifies segments of the array where elements are the same.
   - However, the solution does not fully address the requirement to ensure the array stops being beautiful. Specifically, it does not account for the condition where removing elements can break the beauty property.
   - The solution only counts consecutive elements and does not consider the possibility of breaking the beauty property by removing elements strategically.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the second test case, the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` is identified as having a segment of length 2 (`cnt = 2`). However, this does not guarantee that removing 1 element will break the beauty property.
   - In the fourth test case, the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]` is identified as having a segment of length 3 (`cnt = 3`). Again, this does not guarantee that removing 3 elements will break the beauty property.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only counts consecutive elements without considering the strategic removal of elements.
