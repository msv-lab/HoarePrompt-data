Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, `cnt` is 1, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = a[0]` simply assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Since `tmp` was previously equal to the first element of the list `a`, it remains the same. The variable `cnt` is updated to 1 because we have now considered the first element of the list.
