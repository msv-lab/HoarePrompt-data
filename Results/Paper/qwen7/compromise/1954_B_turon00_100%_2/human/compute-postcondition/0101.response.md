Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `2 * n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` holds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, `t` is decreased by `n`, `n` remains unchanged, and `a[i]` is out of bounds since `i` is now `2 * n`. The current value of `n` is either 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`.
