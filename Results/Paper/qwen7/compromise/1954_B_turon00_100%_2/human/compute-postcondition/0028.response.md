Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `cnt` remains the count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each occurrence of `tmp` in the list `a` during the loop execution.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`. The variables `i` and `tmp` remain unchanged from their previous states, and `cnt` retains its count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`.
