Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `2 * n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` holds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, `t` is decreased by `n`, `n` remains unchanged, and `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the list `a`.
