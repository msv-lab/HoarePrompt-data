Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `n` and `1`, `t` is decreased by `1`, `n` is an input integer that must be at least `1`, and `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is `2`; otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is `0`.
