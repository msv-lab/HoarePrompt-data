Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n`: This variable determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
   - The value of `i` at the start of the loop should be 0, as the loop starts with `i = 0`.

3. **Adjust the Given States**:
   - The initial state of `cnt` (which is 0) does not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - The initial state of `t` (which must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)) does not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - The initial state of `a` (which is a list of integers) does not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - The initial state of `tmp` (which is the first element of the list `a`) does not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - The initial state of `ans` (which is equal to `n`) does not affect the loop's execution directly.

4. **Final Adjusted State**:
   - The only variables that need adjustment for the loop to execute are `n` and `i`.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the final state that needs to be adjusted is:
**`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**.

So, the answer is:
State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**.
