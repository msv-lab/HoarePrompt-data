Output State: The list `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`, and `cnt` is 0.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` for each iteration until it reaches `n`. The variable `tmp` remains as the first element of the list `a` because it is not changed within the loop. The variable `ans` is updated in each iteration to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, which tracks the count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp`. Once the loop ends, `cnt` is reset to 0 since there are no more elements to check. Therefore, `ans` will hold the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive identical elements starting with `tmp` in the list `a`.
