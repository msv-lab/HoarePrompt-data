Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` (which is `n`) and `cnt` (which is `0`), `cnt` is `0`, `t` is decreased by `1`, `n` is an input integer that must be at least `1`, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`; `cnt` is updated to `0`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` simply updates the value of `cnt` to `0`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
