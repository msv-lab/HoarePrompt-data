Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is either `1` or `0`, `t` is decreased by `1`, `n` is an input integer that must be at least `1`, and `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value (`ans`) and the value of `cnt`. Since `cnt` is either `1` or `0`, `ans` will be updated to the smaller of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged.
