Output State: **`i` is 2, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is the minimum value between its current value and 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and 1. Since `a[1]` is not referenced in the code, the condition `if a[1] is equal to tmp` does not affect the outcome. The value of `ans` will be set to the minimum of its current value (which is either a non-negative number or 0) and 1. Given that the initial value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and 1, `ans` will be 0 if its current value is greater than 0, otherwise, it remains unchanged. Therefore, the final state of `ans` is the minimum value between its current value and 1.
