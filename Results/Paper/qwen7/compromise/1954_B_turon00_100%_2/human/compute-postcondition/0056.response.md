Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
   - `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`.
   - `cnt` is either 2 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, or 0 if `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `tmp` remains the same as it is initialized before the loop starts and does not change within the loop.
   - The values of `ans` and `cnt` depend on the comparison `a[i] == tmp` in the loop body, but these values are not directly adjusted here.

5. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `n` must remain the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Given the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is either 2 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, or 0 if `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`**.
