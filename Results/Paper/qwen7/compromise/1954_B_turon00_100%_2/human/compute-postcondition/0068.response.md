Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
- `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution.
- `cnt` is 0.
- The condition `(n != 1 and ans != n)` holds true.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(ans)`.

Let's break down the logic:

1. `i` is set to `n`, so `i` equals the length of the list `a`.
2. `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
3. `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution.
4. `cnt` starts at 0.

Given the condition `(n != 1 and ans != n)` is true, it implies that `n` is greater than 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

Since `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp`, and the condition ensures that `ans` is not equal to `n`, `ans` must be a positive integer less than `n`.

However, without knowing the actual contents of the list `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. We only know that it is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` and that it is not equal to `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of tmp found during the loop's execution, and ans is a positive integer less than n)**
