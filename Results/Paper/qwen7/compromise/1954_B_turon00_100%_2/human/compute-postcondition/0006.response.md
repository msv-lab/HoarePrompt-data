Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the initial state, so the values of `cnt`, `t`, `a`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
