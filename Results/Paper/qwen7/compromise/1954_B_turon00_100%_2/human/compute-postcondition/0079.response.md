Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is `n`, `cnt` is 1, `t` is decreased by 1, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 1, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 0, so now it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
