Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `i` is `2 * n`.
- `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
- `ans` holds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution.
- `t` is decreased by `n`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a[i]` is out of bounds since `i` is now `2 * n` and the loop has completed.
- The condition `n == 1 or ans == n` is satisfied.

Given this information, the print statement `print(-1)` will simply output `-1`.

Output: **-1**
