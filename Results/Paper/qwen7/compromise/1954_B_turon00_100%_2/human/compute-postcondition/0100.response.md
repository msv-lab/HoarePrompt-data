Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `2 * n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` holds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, `t` is decreased by `n`, `n` remains unchanged, and `a[i]` is out of bounds since `i` is now `2 * n` and the loop has completed.**

This output state reflects the changes and conditions after the given code snippet has been executed. The values of `i`, `tmp`, `ans`, `t`, and `n` are updated according to the provided logic, while `a` retains its initial state as a list of integers. The condition `a[i]` being out of bounds indicates that the index `i` (which is now `2 * n`) exceeds the length of the list `a`.
