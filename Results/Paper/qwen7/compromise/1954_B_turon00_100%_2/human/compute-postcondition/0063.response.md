Output State: The list `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution, and `cnt` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches `n`. The variable `tmp` remains unchanged as it is only initialized and never modified within the loop. The variable `ans` retains the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found during the loop's execution. Finally, `cnt` is reset to 0 after the last iteration since the condition `if a[i] == tmp:` is no longer met when `i` equals `n`.
