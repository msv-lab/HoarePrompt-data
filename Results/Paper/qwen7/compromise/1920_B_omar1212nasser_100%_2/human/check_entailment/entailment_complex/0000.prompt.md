Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

# Annotated Functions:
func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)
        
    #State: After executing the loop for each test case, the output will be a series of lines, each containing the result of the `func_2(k, x, a)` function call for that test case, where `a` is a sorted list of integers provided as input for that test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It sorts the list \( a \) and then calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute a product based on the sorted list. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2(k, x, a)` for each test case.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, negatives is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and elements is a list of integers representing the array.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: Output State: `pos` is a list of integers where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration of the loop, `removals` remains the same as its initial value, `negatives` remains the same as its initial value, and `elements` is the same list of integers as in the initial state but with the last `i` elements removed for each iteration of the loop.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which is composed of elements calculated as `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration of the loop, with the last `i` elements removed from the original `elements` list for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` represents the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` represents the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers. The function calculates a series of values based on the sum of the elements and their subsets, removing elements in each iteration and adjusting sums accordingly. It then returns the maximum value from this series of calculated values.
