Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it.
   - Finally, it calls `func_2` with the sorted array and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `removals` (number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (number of elements Bob can negate), and `elements` (the sorted array).
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the entire array.
   - It appends the sum after removing the last `negatives` elements and negating them twice (since they are already counted in the sum).
   - It iterates up to `removals` times, updating the sum `s` and the sum `s2` of the last `negatives + i` elements.
   - In each iteration, it updates `pos` with the new sum after removing `i` elements and negating `negatives` elements.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value in `pos`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array is necessary to consider the smallest elements first when Alice removes elements and Bob negates elements.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the sum after Alice removes up to `removals` elements and Bob negates up to `negatives` elements.
   - The variable `s` keeps track of the current sum of the array.
   - The variable `s2` keeps track of the sum of the last `negatives + i` elements, which helps in calculating the effect of negating those elements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where Alice might remove all elements or Bob might negate all elements.
   - The program correctly considers the scenario where Alice removes some elements and Bob negates some elements.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice's strategy is to remove the smallest elements to minimize the impact on the sum.
   - Bob's strategy is to negate the largest elements to minimize the sum further.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic in both functions is correct and follows the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
