Output State: `pos` is a list of integers where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * s2` after removing `i` elements from the end of `elements` for `i` ranging from 1 to `removals`, `removals` remains the same, `negatives` remains the same, and `elements` has its last `removals` elements removed. `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the updated `elements`.
