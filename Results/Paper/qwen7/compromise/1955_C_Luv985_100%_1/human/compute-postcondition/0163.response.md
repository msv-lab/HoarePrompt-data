Postcondition: **`ans` is the total number of times `a[l]` or `a[r]` became 0 during the loop's execution, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is adjusted based on the conditions inside the loop, `l` is incremented by 1 every time `a[l]` becomes 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` at the end of the last iteration, and `a[r]` or `a[r - 1]` is decreased by `mi` if it was involved in the last subtraction. Additionally, the condition `l == r` is true.**
