Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
while T:
    T -= 1
    n, k = input().split()
    n = int(n)
    k = int(k)
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    ans = 0
    while l < r and k > 0:
        mi = min(a[l], a[r])
        if mi * 2 <= k:
            a[l] -= mi
            a[r] -= mi
            k -= mi * 2
            if a[l] == 0:
                ans += 1
                l += 1
            if a[r] == 0:
                ans += 1
                r -= 1
        else:
            t = k % 2
            if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
            break
    if l == r:
        ans += k >= a[l]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is the total number of times either `a[l]` or `a[r]` became zero plus `k >= a[l]`, `k` is reduced according to the operations performed within the loop, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` at each iteration.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `ans` is the total number of times `a[l]` or `a[r]` became 0 during the loop's execution plus `k >= a[l]`, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is adjusted based on the conditions inside the loop, `l` is incremented by 1 for each zero encountered at position `l`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` (or `a[r - 1]` if `r` was decremented) at the end of the loop, and `a[r]` or `a[r - 1]` is decreased by `mi` if it was involved in the last subtraction. Additionally, the condition `l == r` is true.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is -1, `r` is 0, `k` is 0, `l` is `n - 1`, `mi` is `a[l]` since `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is the total number of operations performed (which remains unchanged), `a[r]` is 0, `t` is `k % 2` which is 0, and `l` is equal to `r` because `l` equals `r` when the condition `l == r` is met.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
