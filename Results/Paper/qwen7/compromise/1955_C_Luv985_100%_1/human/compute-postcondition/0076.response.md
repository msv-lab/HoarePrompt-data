Postcondition: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `n` must be at least 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be 3 and `r` must be `n-3`, `ans` is either 5 or 4, `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, and if `a[r]` equals 0, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
