Output State: **`a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `n` must be at least 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be 2 and `r` must be `n-2`, `ans` is either 3 or 2, `t` is `k % 2`**.

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[r]`. Here, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. Therefore, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. The value of `a[l]` is also updated to `a[l] - mi` because `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and updating `a[r]` affects the minimum value. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
