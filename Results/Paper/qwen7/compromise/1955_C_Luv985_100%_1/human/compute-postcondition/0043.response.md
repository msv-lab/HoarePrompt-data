Output State: **`k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`, `T` is an input integer, `n` must be at least 3, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 1, `r` is `n-2`, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by `2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum of `a[1]` and `a[n-2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
