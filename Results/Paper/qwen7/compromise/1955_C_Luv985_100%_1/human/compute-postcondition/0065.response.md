Output State: **`a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n-2`, `ans` is 4, `t` is `k % 2`**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` is 2, so after executing the code, `l` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
