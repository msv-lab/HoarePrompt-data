Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is `k - (min(a[l], a[r]) * 2)`, `l` is `l + 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is `k % 2` if the condition is false, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.

This means that if `a[l]` equals 0, then `ans` remains as 1, `T` stays `False`, `r` remains as `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is updated by subtracting twice the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` from its current value, `l` is incremented by 1, `mi` is the minimum of the new `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is `k % 2` if the condition is false, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`. If `a[l]` does not equal 0, then no changes occur to the variables mentioned.
