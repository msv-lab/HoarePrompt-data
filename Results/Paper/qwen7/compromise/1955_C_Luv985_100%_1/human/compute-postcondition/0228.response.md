Postcondition: **`T` is -1, `r` must be greater than `l` (either 2 or 1), `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is `min(a[l], 0)`, `ans` is increased by 1 to either 3 or 4, `a[r]` is 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi`, `l` is `l + 1`**.

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `a[l] == 0` is true, then `l` is incremented by 1. If the condition is false, no additional changes are made as specified in the else part.
