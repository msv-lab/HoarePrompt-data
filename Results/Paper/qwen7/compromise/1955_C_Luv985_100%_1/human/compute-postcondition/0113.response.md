Output State: **`ans` is 0, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`**.

The code `t = k % 2` assigns the value of `k % 2` to the variable `t`. Since the initial value of `k` is not specified, `t` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is even or odd. However, without knowing the exact value of `k`, we can only express `t` as `k % 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
