Output State: **`T` is -1, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `l` is 1, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `ans` is 2, `a[r]` is 0, and the condition `l == r` is now false.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is 1, so after executing this line, `ans` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
