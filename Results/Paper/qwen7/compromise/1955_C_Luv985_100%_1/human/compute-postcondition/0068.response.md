Output State: **`a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 3, `r` is `n-2`, `ans` is 5, `t` is `k % 2`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was 4, so after executing this line, `ans` becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
