Output State: **`ans` is 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 1`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is `l + 1` less than `r`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `l` is now `l + 1`.
