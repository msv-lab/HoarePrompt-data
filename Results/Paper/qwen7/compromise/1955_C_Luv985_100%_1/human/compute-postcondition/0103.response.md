Postcondition: `ans` is 1, `T` is `False`, `r` is `n - 1`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `l` is `l + 1`. If `a[l]` equals 0, then `ans` is set to 1 and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `ans`, `T`, `r`, `k`, `mi`, `a[l]`, and `a[r]` remain unchanged.
