Output State: **`T` is -1, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `k` is the value of input split converted to an integer, `l` is incremented by 1 for each zero encountered at position `l`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` (or `a[r - 1]` if `r` was decremented), and `a[r]` or `a[r - 1]` is decreased by `mi` if it was involved in the last subtraction. Additionally, the condition `l == r` is now false; `n` is now an input integer, `a` is the list of integers obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` converts each element in the list `a` from a string to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the list `a` is updated to contain integers instead of strings, while the other variables retain their original descriptions.
