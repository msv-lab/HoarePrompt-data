Output State: **`T` is -1, `r` is 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `mi` is `min(a[l], 0)`, `ans` is 4, `a[r]` is 0, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi`, `l` is `l + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given that `r` must be greater than `l` and initially was either 2 or 1, after decrementing, `r` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
