Reasoning:
- The provided program aims to simulate the process of the Kraken attacking the ships and determining how many ships sink.
- The program correctly initializes the variables and processes each test case individually.
- It uses a while loop to handle the attacks, alternating between the first and last ships.
- The logic inside the loop correctly handles the reduction of durability and checks if a ship sinks.
- The handling of the final state where only one ship remains is also correctly implemented.
- The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem description accurately.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
