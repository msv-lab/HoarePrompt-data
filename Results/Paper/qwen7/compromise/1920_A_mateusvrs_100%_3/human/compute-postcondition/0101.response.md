Output State: `r` is a list, `t` is at least 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing all integers `x` that were added during the loop, `ax` is the minimum value among all integers `x` that were processed (or 1000000007 if no such `x` was processed), `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer (either 1 or not 1), `x` is an input integer. If `a` equals 1, `ax` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `-1`; otherwise, `ax` is updated to be the minimum of the original `ax` and `x`. The loop has completed all its iterations, and `r`, `t`, and `_` reflect the completion of the loop with `r` being a list, `t` being at least 0, and `_` being 0.
