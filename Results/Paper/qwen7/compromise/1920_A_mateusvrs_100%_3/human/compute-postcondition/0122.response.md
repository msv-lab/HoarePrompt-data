Postcondition: **`r` is a list containing either 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `t` is at least 0 and does not change during the loop, `_` is 0, `n` is 0, `cx` contains all unique integers `x` entered during the loop, `ax` is the minimum of the smallest `x` entered and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum value among all integers `x` entered, `a` is the last value read from input during the loop, `x` is the last value read from input during the loop, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` if `bx > ax`, otherwise `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is added to `r`.**
