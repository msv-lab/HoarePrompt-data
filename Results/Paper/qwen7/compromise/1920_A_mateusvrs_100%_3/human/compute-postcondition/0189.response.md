Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a series of constraints defined by integers \(a\) and \(x\). It calculates and stores the difference between the minimum and maximum \(x\) values that meet specific conditions (type 1 and type 2 constraints), adjusting this difference based on the count of additional \(x\) values within a certain range. Finally, it prints a list of results, one for each test case, indicating the calculated differences or zero if no valid \(x\) values meet the conditions.**
