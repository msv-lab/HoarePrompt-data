Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is either the minimum of `x` and 1000007 or 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The variable `bx` is updated to be the maximum value between `x` and its current value `-1`. Since `x` is an integer from the input, `bx` will now hold the larger of `x` and `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
