Output State: **`r` is a list, `t` is at least 1 (decreased by 1), `_` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as input, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values provided as input (or 1000000007 if no valid `x` is provided), `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values provided as input (-1 if no valid `x` is provided), and `tmp` remains unchanged.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
