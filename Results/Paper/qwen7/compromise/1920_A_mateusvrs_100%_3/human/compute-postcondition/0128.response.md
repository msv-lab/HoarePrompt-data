Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `_` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `_` is initially 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is being incremented within the loop but its initial value (1) does not affect whether the loop can start or not.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `_` (which is 1) does not need to be adjusted because the loop will start from this value and increment internally.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`_` is 1, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1**
