Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tmp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as input, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values provided as input (or 1000000007 if no valid `x` is provided), and `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values provided as input (or -1 if no valid `x` is provided).
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i`, `bx`, and `ax` are integers. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is increased by 1. There is no change in `tmp` if `i` does not satisfy the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `cx`, `bx` is the same, `ax` is the same, and if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `cx`, `bx` is the same, `ax` is the same. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
