Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is a list, `t` is at least 0 and does not change during the loop, `_` is `n`, `n` is 0, `cx` contains all unique integers `x` that were input during the loop, `ax` is the minimum of the smallest `x` entered and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` entered, `a` is the last value read from input during the loop, `x` is the last value read from input during the loop, and `tmp` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cx` must contain at least one element, and if the index `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, then `tmp` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cx` must contain at least one element, `i` will be the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cx` must contain at least two elements, `i` will be the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
