Postcondition: `_` is 1, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` equals 1, then `ax` is 1000000007 and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000007.
