Output State: **`cx` has been iterated over, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`, `r` has a new element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `r` the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`. Here, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`. The values of `cx`, `tmp`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged from their previous states, while `r` gains a new element based on the calculation involving `ax`, `bx`, and `tmp`.
