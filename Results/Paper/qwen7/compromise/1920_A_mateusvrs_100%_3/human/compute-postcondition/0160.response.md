Postcondition: **`_` is 3, `t` is at least 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: 
- If `a == 2`, then `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
- If `a != 2`, then `cx` becomes a set containing `x`, and `ax` remains unchanged as the minimum of `x` and `ax`.

Since the else part is executed when `a != 2`, the overall postcondition follows the conditions specified in the else part.
