Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is a list containing either 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
   - `t` is at least 0 and does not change during the loop.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `cx` contains all unique integers `x` entered during the loop.
   - `ax` is the minimum of the smallest `x` entered and 1000000007.
   - `bx` is the maximum value among all integers `x` entered.
   - `a` is the last value read from input during the loop.
   - `x` is the last value read from input during the loop.
   - `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` if `bx > ax`, otherwise `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` is added to `r`.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `_` is used as the loop counter and starts from 0, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is a constant for the entire loop.

Given that `_` starts from 0 and is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, after the first iteration, `_` will be 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `_` will be 1.
- `t` remains the same (at least 0).

The other variables (`r`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `a`, `x`, `tmp`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are determined by the loop body, which is omitted in this context.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`_` is 1, `t` is at least 0**
