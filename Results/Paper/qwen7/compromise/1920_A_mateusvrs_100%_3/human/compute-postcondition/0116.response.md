The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cx`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being an element of `cx`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `cx` must contain at least one element.
- `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
- `tmp` is increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be the next element in `cx`.
- `cx` must still contain at least one element.
- `tmp` will be increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, or it will remain unchanged based on the value of `i`.

Since `cx` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, and `i` will be the next element in `cx`, we need to ensure that `cx` has at least two elements for the next iteration (so that there is a next element).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`cx` must contain at least two elements, `i` will be the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`, otherwise `tmp` remains unchanged.**
