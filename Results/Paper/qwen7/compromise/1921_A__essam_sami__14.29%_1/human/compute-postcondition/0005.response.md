Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves four lines of input representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the squared distance between two pairs of opposite corners and prints the smaller distance. The function does not return any value but outputs the minimum distance for each test case.**
