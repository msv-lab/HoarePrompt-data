Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to t (inclusive), and every second element in `a` is reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses every second element in the list `a`. Since `a` is initially a list of integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive), after executing the code, the elements at even indices (0-based) in `a` will be reversed. For example, if `t` is 5, `a` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` initially, and after the code, `a` would become `[1, 4, 3, 2, 5]`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
