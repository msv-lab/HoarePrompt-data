Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here's why:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires finding a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that for no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)), \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_j \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1()` generates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `t` and reverses every second element. This does not guarantee that the resulting permutation will satisfy the divisibility condition required by the problem.

3. **Examples Provided**:
   - For \( t = 4 \), the output is `[1, 4, 3, 2]`. This permutation does not satisfy the condition because \( 1 \) divides \( 3 \) and \( 4 \) divides \( 2 \).
   - For \( t = 3 \), the output is `[1, 3, 2]`. This permutation also does not satisfy the condition because \( 1 \) divides \( 2 \).

Given these points, the function does not produce a valid permutation according to the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
