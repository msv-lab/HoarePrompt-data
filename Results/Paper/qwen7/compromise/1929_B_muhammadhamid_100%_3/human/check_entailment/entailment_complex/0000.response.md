Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
2. The solution provided handles three main cases:
   - When \( k = 1 \), it prints `1` because coloring just one cell can satisfy the condition.
   - When \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \), it calculates \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).

3. Let's analyze the logic:
   - The expression \( 2(n + (n - 2)) \) simplifies to \( 4n - 4 \). This means the condition \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) is checked.
   - If \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), the number of cells needed is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
   - If \( k > 4n - 4 \), the number of cells needed is \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).

4. The provided examples match the logic:
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \): \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \): \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \): \( \frac{10}{2} + 1 = 6 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \): \( \frac{9}{2} + 1 = 5 \).
   - For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \): \( \frac{7}{2} + 1 = 4 \).
   - For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 11 \): \( \frac{11}{2} + 1 = 6 \).
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \): \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \).

Given the analysis and the matching examples, the provided logic correctly implements the required functionality.
