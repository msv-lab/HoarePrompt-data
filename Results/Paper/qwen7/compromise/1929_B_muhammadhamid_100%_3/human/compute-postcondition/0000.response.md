Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`, which should match the value of `t`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must equal `t`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value matches `t`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` such that when `int(input())` is called, it returns the value of `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and int(input()) must return the value of t**
