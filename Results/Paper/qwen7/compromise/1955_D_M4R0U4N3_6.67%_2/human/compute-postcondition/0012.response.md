Output State: **`j` is 0, `m` is at least 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers obtained from the input split, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]`, and `a[j]` is in `extra`.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `a[j]` (which is `a[0]` since `j` is 0) to the `extra` set. All other variables remain unchanged.
