Output State: **`r` is either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`, `old` is no longer in `done`, `extra` does not contain `old`, `todo` includes `old` if `old` was in `done` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1, `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`, `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo` if `len(done) >= k`.**

The code removes `old` from the `done` list. This affects the `done`, `extra`, and `todo` lists based on the conditions provided. The value of `r`, `ans`, and the conditions for updating `extra` and `todo` remain unchanged from their initial states.
