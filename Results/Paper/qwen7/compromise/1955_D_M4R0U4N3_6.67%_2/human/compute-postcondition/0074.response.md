Postcondition: `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is either in `done` or `extra`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo` unless the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is increased by 1. If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`; otherwise, `old` is added to `todo`.
