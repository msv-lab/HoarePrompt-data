Output State: **`r` remains either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`, `old` is moved to `todo`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. It does not affect the value of `r`, which remains either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`. Additionally, `old` is moved to `todo`, and `ans` is incremented by 1. The conditions within the if-else block do not execute here since they depend on the values of `a[r]`, `todo`, `done`, and `k`, which are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `extra` and `todo` remain unchanged from their previous states.
