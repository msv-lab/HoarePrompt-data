Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0; `j` is equal to `m`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set that may contain some integers, `done` is a set that contains integers that were found in `todo` and removed from it, and `extra` is a set that contains integers that were not found in `todo` but were present in `a`.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo`. Otherwise, if `a[r]` is in `extra` and `old` is no longer in `extra`, then either `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`, or no changes occur to `done` and `todo`. Additionally, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is either in `done` or `extra`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo` unless the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is increased by 1. If `old` is in `extra`, it is removed from `extra`; otherwise, `old` is added to `todo`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is `m + 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is either added to `done` or `extra`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo` unless the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is increased by 1; if `old` is in `extra`, `extra.remove(old)` is executed and `old` is no longer assigned the value of `a[r - m]`; if `old` is in `done`, `ans` is increased by 1 and `todo` now contains `old`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
