Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` and `m`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0
   - `m` is at least 1
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split
   - `todo` is a set containing integers
   - `done` is an empty set
   - Either `extra` is an empty set with `a[j]` removed from `todo` and added to `done`, or `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` with `a[j]` added to `extra`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 0 and `m` is at least 1, the loop can continue if `j` is incremented to 1.
   - After incrementing `j` to 1, the new value of `j` will be 1.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `j` becomes 1
   - `m` remains at least 1 (it could be 1 or any larger value)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 1, `m` is at least 1**
