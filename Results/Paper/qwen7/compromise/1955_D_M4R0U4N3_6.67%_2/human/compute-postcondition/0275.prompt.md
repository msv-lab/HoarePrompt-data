Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k` else 0, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers, `done` is a set containing all integers from `todo` that were found in `a`, `extra` is a set containing all integers from `a` that were not found in `todo`, and `j` is equal to `m` since the loop has completed all its iterations.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is found in `extra`, then `old` is no longer in `extra`. If `old` is found in `done`, then `old` is added to `todo`. If `old` is not in `done`, then `old` remains unchanged in `todo`. Additionally, if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `a[r]` is not in `todo` and may or may not be in `extra` or `done` depending on the conditions mentioned, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is either `r_end + 1` or `r_end + 2`, `old` is either `a[r - m]` or `a[r - m - 1]`, `extra` does not contain `old`, `done` includes `old` if `old` was in `todo` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `done`, `todo` includes `old` if `old` was in `done` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1, `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`, and `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo` if `len(done) >= k`. Otherwise, the same conditions as the precondition hold.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `r` remains either `r_end + 3` or `r_end + 4`. `old` is moved to `todo`, and `ans` is incremented by 1. Depending on the condition in the if statement, `extra` and `todo` are updated as follows:
- If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo`.
- If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` includes `a[r]`, and `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo` if `len(done) >= k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
