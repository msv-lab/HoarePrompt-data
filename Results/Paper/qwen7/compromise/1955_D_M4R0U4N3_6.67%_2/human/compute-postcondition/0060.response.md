Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is in `todo`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo`, `old` is removed from `extra`, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `extra.remove(old)` removes the value of `old` from the list `extra`. Since `old` was previously defined as `a[r - m]`, it is now removed from the `extra` list. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
