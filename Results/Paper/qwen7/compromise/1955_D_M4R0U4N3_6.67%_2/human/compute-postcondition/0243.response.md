Output State: **`r` is `r_end + 1`, `old` is `a[r_end + 1 - m]`, `extra` is `extra - {old}` if `old` was in `extra`, `done` is `done + {a[r_end + 1]}` if `a[r_end + 1]` was in `todo`, `todo` is `todo - {a[r_end + 1]}` if `a[r_end + 1]` was in `todo` and `todo + {old}` if `old` was in `done`, `old` is now `a[r - m]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[r - m]` to the variable `old`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their previous conditions. Specifically, `r` remains `r_end + 1`, `old` is updated to be `a[r - m]`, and the conditions for `extra`, `done`, and `todo` remain as described in the initial state.
