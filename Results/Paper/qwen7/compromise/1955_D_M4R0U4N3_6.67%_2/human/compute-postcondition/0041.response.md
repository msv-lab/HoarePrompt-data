Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`, and `old` is not in `extra`. If `old` is in `done`, then `old` is removed from `done` and `todo` contains `old`. If `old` is not in `done`, then no changes occur to `done` and `todo`.
