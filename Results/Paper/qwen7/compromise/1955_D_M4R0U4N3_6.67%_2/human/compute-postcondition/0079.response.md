Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is either in `done` or `extra`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo` unless the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is increased by 1; `ans` is increased by 1 if `old` was in `done`; `todo` now contains `old`.**

Explanation: The line `todo.add(old)` adds the variable `old` to the set `todo`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
