Output State: **`old` is not in `done`, `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`, and `old` is not in `extra`.**

Explanation: The code removes `old` from the list `done`. Since `old` was previously in `done`, it is no longer part of `done` after this operation. The other conditions (that `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]` and `old` is not in `extra`) remain unchanged.
