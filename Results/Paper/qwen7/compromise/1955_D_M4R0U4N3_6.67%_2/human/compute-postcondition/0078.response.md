Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that `m <= n`, `a[r]` is either in `done` or `extra`, no changes occur to `done` and `todo` unless the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, in which case `ans` is increased by 1; `ans` is increased by 1 if `old` was in `done`.**

Explanation: The code removes `old` from the list `done`. The value of `old` is assigned as `a[r - m]` from the initial state. Since `done.remove(old)` is executed, `ans` is increased by 1 if `old` was present in `done`. All other variables remain unchanged.
