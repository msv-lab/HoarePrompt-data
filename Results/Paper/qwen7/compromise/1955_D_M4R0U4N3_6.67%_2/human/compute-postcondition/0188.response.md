Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values, `ans` retains its original value, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `todo` is a set of integers from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `todo = set(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and adds these integers to a set called `todo`. The variables `a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `ans`, and `r` are not affected by this operation, so they retain their original values. The `todo` set is updated with the new values from the input.
