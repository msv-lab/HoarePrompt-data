Postcondition: `r` is either `r_end + 1` or `r_end + 2`, `old` is either `a[r - m]` or `a[r - m - 1]`, `extra` does not contain `old`, `done` includes `old` if `old` was in `todo` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `done`, `todo` includes `old` if `old` was in `done` and does not include `old` if `old` was in `todo`, `ans` is increased by 1, `extra` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `extra` or `todo`, and `todo` is updated accordingly based on whether `old` was in `done` or `todo`.

This means that regardless of the condition in the if statement, the following conditions hold true after the execution of the if-else block: `r` remains either `r_end + 1` or `r_end + 2`, `old` remains either `a[r - m]` or `a[r - m - 1]`, `extra` still does not contain `old`, `done` and `todo` are updated according to their previous states, and `ans` is incremented by 1.
