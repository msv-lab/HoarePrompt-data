Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
    done = set()
    extra = set()
    for j in range(m):
        if a[j] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[j])
            done.add(a[j])
        else:
            extra.add(a[j])
    ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
    for r in range(m, n):
        old = a[r - m]
        if old in extra:
            extra.remove(old)
        elif old in done:
            done.remove(old)
            todo.add(old)
        if a[r] in todo:
            todo.remove(a[r])
            done.add(a[r])
        else:
            extra.add(a[r])
        if len(done) >= k:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will continue to iterate until `r` reaches `n-1`. After all iterations, `r` will be `n-1`. For each iteration, the value of `old` will be updated to `a[r - m]`. The variable `ans` will be incremented by 1 whenever the length of `done` becomes greater than or equal to `k`. The sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` will be modified based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically, elements will be moved between these sets according to whether they are found in `todo`, `extra`, or neither. The final state will reflect the cumulative effect of all these operations over the entire range of `r` from `m` to `n-1`.

The output state after all the executions of the loop will be characterized by the final values of `r`, `ans`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra`, with `r` being `n-1`, `ans` being the total count of times the condition `len(done) >= k` was met during the loop's execution, and the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` reflecting the changes made during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be equal to the number of times the condition `len(done) >= k` evaluates to True during the loop's execution, `r` will be equal to `n - 1`, and the sets `done`, `todo`, and `extra` will reflect the final state of these sets after processing all elements from index `m` to `n-1` in the list `a` according to the rules specified in the loop body.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All integers in `todo` have been processed and either moved to `done` or added to `extra`. The variable `ans` contains the total number of times the condition `len(done) >= k` was met during the loop's execution. The variable `r` equals `n - 1`, and `j` equals `m` since the loop has completed all its iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
