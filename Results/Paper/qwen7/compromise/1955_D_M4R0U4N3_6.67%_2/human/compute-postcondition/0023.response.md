Output State: **`j` is 2; `m` is at least 1; `todo` list has had its element at index 2 removed; `done` set has added the element `a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element at index `j` of the list `a` to the set `done`. Given that `j` is 2, the element `a[2]` is added to the set `done`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
