Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, the number of iterations left to execute is one less than the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `a`. The values of `m` and `k` remain unchanged, and the number of iterations left to execute is reduced by one compared to the previous iteration.
