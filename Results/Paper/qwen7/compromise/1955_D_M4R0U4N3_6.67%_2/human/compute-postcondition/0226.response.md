Postcondition: `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is found in `extra`, then `extra` is updated to exclude `old`. If `old` is not in `extra`, it is checked against `done`. If `old` is found in `done`, it is added to `todo`. If `old` is not in `done`, it remains unchanged in terms of being added to `todo`.
