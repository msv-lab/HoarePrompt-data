You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute until `r` reaches `n-1`. After all iterations, the following will be true:
    #- `r` will be equal to `n-1`.
    #- `ans` will contain the total number of times the condition `len(done) >= k` was met during the loop's execution.
    #- The sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` will reflect the final state of these sets after processing all elements from index `m` to `n-1` in the list `a` according to the rules specified in the loop body.
    #
    #All integers in `todo` have been processed and either moved to `done` or added to `extra`. The final value of `ans` will be the cumulative count of times the condition `len(done) >= k` was satisfied throughout the entire loop execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Problem**: The problem requires us to check how many subarrays of length `m` in array `a` can be rearranged to have at least `k` elements matching with array `b`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - We need to maintain a sliding window of size `m` over array `a`.
   - For each position of the window, we need to check if we can rearrange the elements within the window to match at least `k` elements from array `b`.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - Use sets `todo` and `done` to keep track of elements that are needed and already matched from array `b`.
   - Use a set `extra` to keep track of elements that are extra in the current window.
   - Slide the window over array `a` and update the sets accordingly.
   - Check if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` after each update.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code correctly initializes the sets and updates them as the window slides.
   - It checks the condition for each window and increments the answer if the condition is met.
   - The logic for updating the sets (`todo`, `done`, `extra`) is correct and handles the addition and removal of elements properly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the sliding window approach efficiently.
   - It correctly manages the transition of elements between `todo`, `done`, and `extra` sets.
   - The logic for checking the condition (`len(done) >= k`) is implemented correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct and should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
