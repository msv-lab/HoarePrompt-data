Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 6, `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `3` (the start of the range) plus the number of iterations minus one. Since the loop runs from `3` to `n` inclusive and we are given that it executes 3 times, `i` will be `3 + 3 - 1 = 5` if `n` was just enough to make it run 3 times. However, since the question asks for the state after all iterations, and the loop increments `i` each time it runs, `i` will be `3 + 3 = 6` after 3 full iterations. Therefore, `i` will be `6`, and `n` must be at least `6` to allow the loop to run 3 full times. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
