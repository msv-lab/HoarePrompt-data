Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to 8.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `3 <= i <= n + 1`. Given that `i` is initially set to 8, the loop will start executing if `n` is at least 8 (since `i` starts from 3 and goes up to `n + 1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 8, it satisfies the starting condition of the loop.
   - The variable `n` must be at least 8 for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be at least 8.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 8, `n` must be at least 8**
