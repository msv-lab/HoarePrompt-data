Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `i` is 9.
   - `n` must be at least 9.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(3, n + 1)`. This means `i` must be between 3 and `n + 1` (inclusive).

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 9, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is still within the range defined by `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increment by 1 (since `i` starts from 9 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration), making `i` equal to 10.
   - Therefore, `n` must still be at least 10 to allow `i` to be within the range.

5. **Construct the new state**: Based on the above analysis, the updated state for the next iteration should be:
   - `t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 50).
   - `i` is now 10.
   - `n` must be at least 10.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 10, `n` must be at least 10**
