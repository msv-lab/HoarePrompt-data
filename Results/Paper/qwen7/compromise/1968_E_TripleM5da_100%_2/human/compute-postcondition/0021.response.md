Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `3` to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
   - `i` is 7
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 7

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 3 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 7.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making it 8.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 8 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` changes from 7 to 8.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 8.

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 8, `n` must be greater than or equal to 8**
