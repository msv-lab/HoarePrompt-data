Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 8, `n` is greater than 7.

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged and stays within the range of 1 to 50. The variable `i` is now 8, as it was incremented by the loop each time it ran. The variable `n` must still be greater than 7 for the loop to have completed all its iterations.
