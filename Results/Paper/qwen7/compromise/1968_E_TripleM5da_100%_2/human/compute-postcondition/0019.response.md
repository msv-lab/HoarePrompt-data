Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 7.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `3 <= i <= n`. 

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initially 7, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 7 for the loop to start executing.
   - The value of `t` (which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50) does not directly affect the loop's execution based on the given information, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than or equal to 7, and `i` is 7.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 7, `n` must be greater than or equal to 7**
