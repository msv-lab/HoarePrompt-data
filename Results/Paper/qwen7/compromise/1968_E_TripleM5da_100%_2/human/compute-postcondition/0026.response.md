Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 10, `n` is greater than 9.

**Natural Language Description:** After all the iterations of the loop have finished, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 50, `i` will be 10 (since it starts at 7 and increments by 1 each iteration, and the loop runs until `i` reaches 10), and `n` must be greater than 9 because the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.
