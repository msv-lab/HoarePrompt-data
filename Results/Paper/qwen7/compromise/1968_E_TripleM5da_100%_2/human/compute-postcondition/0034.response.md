Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `i` is 8.
   - `n` must be at least 8.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(3, n + 1)`. This means `3 <= i <= n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 8.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 3 and increments by default in the range function).
   - Therefore, `i` will be 9.
   - Since `i` is now 9, `n` must still be at least 9 to satisfy the loop condition.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged since it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 9.
   - `n` must be at least 9.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `i` is 9, `n` must be at least 9**
