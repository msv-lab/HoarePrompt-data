Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem describes a game where players take turns removing a fixed number of stones from each non-empty pile, with the player who cannot make a move losing. The solution should determine the winner based on the initial configuration of stone piles.

2. **Key Insight**: The game described is a variant of the Nim game. In Nim, the key concept is the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles. If the XOR of all pile sizes is zero, the second player has a winning strategy; otherwise, the first player has a winning strategy.

3. **Analyzed Code**:
   - The code initializes some variables but does not use them correctly for solving the problem.
   - `func_1()` is supposed to process each test case, but it does not implement the correct logic for determining the winner.
   - The code incorrectly processes the input and does not use the correct algorithm to determine the winner.

4. **Correct Logic**:
   - For each test case, compute the XOR of all pile sizes.
   - If the XOR is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

5. **Verification**:
   - The annotated program does not follow the correct logic for determining the winner.
   - The current implementation is incorrect because it does not use the XOR operation and instead performs unnecessary operations.

Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the correct logic to determine the winner based on the XOR of the pile sizes.
