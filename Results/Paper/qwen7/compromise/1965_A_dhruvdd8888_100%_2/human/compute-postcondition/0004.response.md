Output State: **`ls` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and '0' is added to the set `nums`.**

Explanation: The line `ls = 0` initializes the variable `ls` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`). Therefore, the values of `t`, `N`, and `nums` remain as they were in the initial state, and `ls` is explicitly set to 0.
