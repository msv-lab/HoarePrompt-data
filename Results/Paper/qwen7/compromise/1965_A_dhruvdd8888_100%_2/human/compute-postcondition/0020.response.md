Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of integers `a` (length `n`, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each of the `n` piles. It sorts the list of integers in descending order, subtracts a running total (`ls`) from each element, and then determines whether a certain condition (`cw`) is met. Based on the final state of `cw`, it prints either "Alice" or "Bob".**
