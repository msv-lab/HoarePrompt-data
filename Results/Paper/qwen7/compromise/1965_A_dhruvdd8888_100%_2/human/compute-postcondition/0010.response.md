Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop runs as long as `len(nums) - 2` is greater than or equal to 0. This means the loop will execute if `len(nums) >= 2`.

3. **Adjust the necessary states**: We need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 2. The other variables (`cw`, `ls`, `t`, `N`, `nums`, and `nw`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `len(nums)` to ensure it is at least 2.

**State:**
**`cw` is True, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element is initially from the original list minus `ls`, `nw` is set to True, and `len(nums)` must be at least 2.**
