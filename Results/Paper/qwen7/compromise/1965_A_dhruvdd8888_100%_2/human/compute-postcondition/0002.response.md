Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a set containing elements from the input split by spaces, and '0' is added to the set `nums`.**

The code `nums.add('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the set `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
