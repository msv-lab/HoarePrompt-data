The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of integers and a series of range queries. For each test case, it calculates the bitwise XOR of subarrays defined by the query ranges and determines whether the result is zero. If the result is zero, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases and queries, it prints the results list, which contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.
