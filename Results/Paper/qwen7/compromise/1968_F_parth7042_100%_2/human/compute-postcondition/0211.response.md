Postcondition: `results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES', `q` is greater than 1, `_` is incremented by 1, `l` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`, `r` is the integer value from `data[index + 3]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, and if `x == 0`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
