Output State: **`i` is 4; `index` is increased by 1; `pf[4]` is `pf[3] ^ a[4]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pf[i]` to be the bitwise XOR (`^`) of `pf[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 4, `pf[4]` is set to `pf[3] ^ a[4]`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `index` is increased by 1.
