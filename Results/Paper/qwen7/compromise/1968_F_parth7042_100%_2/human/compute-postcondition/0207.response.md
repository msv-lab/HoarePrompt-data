Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO'; `q` is greater than 1; `_` is incremented by 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`; `r` is the integer value from `data[index + 3]`**

Explanation: The line `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. This means that the references to `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]` in the initial state now refer to `data[index + 2]` and `data[index + 3]` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
