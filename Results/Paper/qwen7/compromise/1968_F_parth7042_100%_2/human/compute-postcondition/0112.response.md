Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; the current value of `x` is 0, which is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `results` list now contains 'YES'**.

Explanation: The code appends the string `'YES'` to the `results` list. This does not affect the values of `q`, `l`, `r`, `index`, or `x`. The precondition that `q` must be greater than 0 and the specific values of `l`, `r`, `index`, and `x` remain unchanged. The only new information is that `results` now includes the string `'YES'`.
