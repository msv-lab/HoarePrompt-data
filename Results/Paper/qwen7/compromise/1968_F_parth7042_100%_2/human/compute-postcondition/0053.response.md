Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index + 6]`, `q` must be greater than 0 and equal to `q - 1`, `index` is `index + 8`, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, and `results` contains either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]`.**

Explanation: The line `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Initially, `index` was set to `index + 6`. After the increment, `index` becomes `index + 8`. All other variables remain unchanged.
