Postcondition: `q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted; if `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, `results` now contains 'YES'; otherwise, `results` now contains 'NO'.
