The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the only impact is that the loop (if there was one) would continue to the next iteration without executing any further statements in the current iteration. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is assigned the value of `data[index]` (as an integer), `r` is now an integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 4, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `results` now contains 'NO', 'YES'**
