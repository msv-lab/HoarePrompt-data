Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES' or 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES'; `q` is greater than 1; `_` is `q - 1`; `l` is converted to an integer from `data[index]`; `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted.**

Explanation: The code `it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)` inserts `l` into the list `v1` while maintaining the sorted order and returns the index where `l` should be inserted. Since the exact values of `l` and `v1` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `it1`, but we know that it is the correct index for inserting `l` in `v1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
