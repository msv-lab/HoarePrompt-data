Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 6, `l` is the integer value from `data[index]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, results is appended with 'NO'**

Explanation:
- The line `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`.
- The variable `index` is incremented by 3 twice, so it is incremented by a total of 6.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it2`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
