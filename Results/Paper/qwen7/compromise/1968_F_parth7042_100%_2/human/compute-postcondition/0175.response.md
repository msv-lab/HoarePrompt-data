Output State: **`i` is 3; `index` is increased by 1; `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`; `mp[pf[3]]` contains `[3]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `mp[pf[i]].append(i)` updates the dictionary `mp` such that the key `pf[i]` (which is `pf[3]` given the current value of `i`) gets appended with the value of `i` (which is 3). Initially, `pf[3]` is `pf[2] ^ a[3]`. Therefore, `mp[pf[3]]` now contains the list `[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
