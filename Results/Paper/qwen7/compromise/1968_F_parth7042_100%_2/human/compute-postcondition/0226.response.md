The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no specific loop context is provided, we assume this statement is within a loop. The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of `results`, `q`, `_`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'YES'; `q` is greater than 1; `_` is `q - 1`; `l` is converted to an integer from `data[index]`; `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.**
