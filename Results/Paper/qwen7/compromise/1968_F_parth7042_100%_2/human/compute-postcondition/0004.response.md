Output State: **`t` is an integer value from `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings representing the split input, `index` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `data`, or `index`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `results` is added as a new variable with an empty list value.
