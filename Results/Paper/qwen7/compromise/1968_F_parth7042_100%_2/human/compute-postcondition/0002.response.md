Output State: **`t` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `data` is a list of strings representing the split input, `index` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to `t`. Since `index` was initially 0, after the assignment, `index` is incremented to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
