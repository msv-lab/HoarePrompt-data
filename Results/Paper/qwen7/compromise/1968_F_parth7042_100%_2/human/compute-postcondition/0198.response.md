Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', 'YES'; `index` is incremented by 3; `l` is assigned the value of `data[index - 4]`; `r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index - 2])`; `x` is 0; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it1` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of `l` in the list `v1`; `it2` is the value of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The conditions involving `it1`, `it2`, and the comparison between `v1[it1]` and `v2[it2]` are still true, but these specific values are not updated by the given code.
