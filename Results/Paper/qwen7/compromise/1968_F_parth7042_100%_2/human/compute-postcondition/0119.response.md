Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer value from `data[index]`; `r` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `q` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `l` remains an integer value from `data[index]`.
- The value of `r` remains an integer value from `data[index + 1]`.
- The value of `index` is increased by 2.
- The value of `x` remains the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
- The value of `v1` remains the value of `mp[pf[r]]`.
- The value of `v2` remains the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`.
- The value of `it2` is calculated as the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted.
