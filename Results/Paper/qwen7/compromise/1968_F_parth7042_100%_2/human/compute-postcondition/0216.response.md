Output State: **`results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES'; `q` is greater than 1; `_` is incremented by 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`; `r` is the integer value from `data[index + 3]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in the range of `v2` up to the end, or the position where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted.**

Explanation: The code snippet `it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` calculates the position `it2` in the list `v2` where the value `r` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `v2`. It does this by finding the leftmost index where `r` can be inserted and then subtracting 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
