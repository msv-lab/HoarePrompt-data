Output State: **`i` is 1, `a[1]` is an integer value from `data[index]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[1]` now holds the integer value from `data[index]`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be at least 1 is still valid, although `n` itself is not directly mentioned or changed in the code.
