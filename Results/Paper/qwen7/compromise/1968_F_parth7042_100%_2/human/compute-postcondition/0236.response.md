Output State: **The final output state will contain 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for all q queries.**

To understand this output state, consider the following points:

- The loop runs `q` times, processing each query defined by `l` and `r` values from the `data` array.
- For each query, the loop checks if the XOR of the prefix sums `pf[r]` and `pf[l-1]` equals zero. If it does, the result is immediately set to 'YES' because the subarray from `l` to `r` has a cumulative XOR of zero.
- If the XOR is not zero, the loop uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find relevant indices in the dictionaries `mp[pf[r]]` and `mp[pf[l-1]]`.
- Based on the positions of these indices and their values, the loop decides whether the subarray from `l` to `r` can be split into two parts with a cumulative XOR of zero, appending either 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list accordingly.
- After all `q` iterations, the `results` list will contain 'YES' and 'NO' entries corresponding to each query processed by the loop.

Thus, the final `results` list will reflect the outcome of all `q` queries processed through the loop, with each entry indicating whether a valid subarray was found for each query.
