Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `pf` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `mp` is a defaultdict where all values are lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `mp` with default values as lists. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `index`, `a`, or `pf`. The `mp` dictionary is now ready to store key-value pairs where the values are lists.
