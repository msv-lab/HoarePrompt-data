Postcondition: **`q` must be greater than 1, `l` is assigned the value of `data[index]` (as an integer), `r` is now an integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 4, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `results` contains either 'NO' or 'YES', depending on whether `x` equals 0. If `x` is 0, `results` contains 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` remains 'NO'.**
