Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `q` is an integer value from `data[index + 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `q`. Since `data[index]` is an integer value (assigned to `n`), `data[index + 1]` is also expected to be an integer value, which is now stored in `q`. The conditions and values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
