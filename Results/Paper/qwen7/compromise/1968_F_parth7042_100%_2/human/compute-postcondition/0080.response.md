Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer value from `data[index + 6 + 10]`, `q` must be greater than 0 and equal to `q - 1 - 1 - 1`, `index` is `index + 10 + 2`, `l` is now `int(data[index])`, `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it2` is the index where `r` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted, `it1` is the index where `l` would be inserted in `v1` to keep it sorted, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`. `results` contains 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions met during the loop iterations. After all iterations, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` and `q` retain their final values, `index` is increased by the total number of iterations (which is `n + 1`), `a` will contain the integers from `data[index - (n + 1) + 1]` to `data[index]`, `pf` will store cumulative XOR results of elements in `a`, and `mp` will map each unique value in `pf` to a list of indices where that value occurs in `pf`.
