Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed all its iterations, so `i` is now `n + 1`. The variable `index` is increased by `n`. The prefix sum array `pf` is updated such that `pf[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n + 1` is the cumulative XOR of the elements `a[1]` to `a[i]`. The dictionary `mp` maps each unique prefix sum to a list of indices where that prefix sum occurs. Specifically, `mp[pf[i]]` contains all indices `i` for which `pf[i]` is the same.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l = int(data[index])
    r = int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
    if x == 0:
        results.append('YES')
        continue
    v1 = mp[pf[r]]
    v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
    it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
    it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
    if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `results` contains 'YES', 'YES' if `it1` is less than `len(v1)` and `it2` is greater than or equal to 0 and `v1[it1]` is less than `v2[it2]`. Otherwise, `results` contains 'YES', 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES' or 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES'; `q` is greater than 1; `_` is incremented by 1; `l` is an integer value from `data[index + 2]`; `r` is the integer value from `data[index + 3]`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index of the first occurrence of `r` in the range of `v2` up to the end, or the position where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then `it2` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `it2` is updated based on the condition of the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` contains 'YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'YES' or 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO'. `q` is greater than 1; `_` is `q - 1`; `l` is converted to an integer from `data[index]`; `r` is now `int(data[index + 1])`; `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`; `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`; `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`; `it2` is the index where `r - 1` would be inserted in `v2` to keep it sorted. If `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] < v2[it2]`, then 'YES' is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 'NO' is appended to `results`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
