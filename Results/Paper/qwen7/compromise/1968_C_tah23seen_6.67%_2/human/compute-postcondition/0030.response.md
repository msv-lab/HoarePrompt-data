Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`. The variables involved in this condition are `ans[i + 1]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`.

3. **Determine the required state for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[2]`) must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` (which is `arr[2]`).

4. **Check the current values**:
   - Since `i` is 1, `ans[2]` is not defined in the given state.
   - We need to ensure that `ans[2]` is initialized in such a way that the loop condition holds true.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - To satisfy the loop condition `ans[2] <= arr[2]`, `ans[2]` must be initialized to a value that is less than or equal to `arr[2]`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to include the initialization of `ans[2]` to a value that satisfies the loop condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1; `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`; `ans[2]` must be less than or equal to `arr[2]`**
