Output State: **`i` is length_of_arr - 2; `ans[i + 1]` is ans[i + 1] + ans[i].**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` increments the value of `ans[i + 1]` by the value of `ans[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The condition that `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]` is still valid, but the exact value of `ans[i + 1]` is now updated to its original value plus `ans[i]`.
