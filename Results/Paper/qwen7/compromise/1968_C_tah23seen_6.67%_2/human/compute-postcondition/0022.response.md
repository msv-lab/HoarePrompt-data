Output State: **`i` is `length_of_arr - 2`; `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` increments the value of `ans[i + 1]` by the value of `ans[i]`. Given the initial state where `ans[i + 1]` is already set to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`, the operation here does not change its value further. Therefore, the value of `ans[i + 1]` remains as `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
