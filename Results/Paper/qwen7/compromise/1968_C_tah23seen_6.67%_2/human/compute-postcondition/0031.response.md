Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`; `ans[2]` must be less than or equal to `arr[2]`; `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[2]` since `i` is 1) by adding `ans[i]` (which is `ans[1]`). Given that `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`, `ans[2]` becomes `ans[1]`. Also, the condition that `ans[2]` must be less than or equal to `arr[2]` remains valid.
