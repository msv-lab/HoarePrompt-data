Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `length_of_arr - 2`.
   - `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` must hold true.

4. **Analyze the Current Values**:
   - Since `i` is `length_of_arr - 2`, `i + 1` would be `length_of_arr - 1`.
   - The current value of `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`.

5. **Ensure the Loop Executes Again**:
   - To ensure the loop executes again, `ans[i + 1]` (which is `ans[length_of_arr - 1]`) must still satisfy the condition `ans[length_of_arr - 1] <= arr[length_of_arr - 1]`.

6. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` remains such that it satisfies the loop condition in the next iteration.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` to ensure it remains less than or equal to `arr[length_of_arr - 1]` in the next iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `length_of_arr - 2`; `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]` and `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[length_of_arr - 1]`**
