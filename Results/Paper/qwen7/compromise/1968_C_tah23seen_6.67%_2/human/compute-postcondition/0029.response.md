Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i + 1]` to be the sum of `arr[i]` and `ans[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` is the sum of all elements in `arr`, the first line of the code sets `i` to 1 and calculates `ans[1]` as `arr[0] + ans[0]`. The value of `ans[0]` is the sum of all elements in `arr` (from `arr[0]` to `arr[length_of_arr - 1]`). Therefore, `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and the total sum of all elements in `arr`, which simplifies to just the total sum since `arr[0]` is part of the total sum.
