Output State: **`i` is `length_of_arr - 2`; `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`; `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[length_of_arr - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is `length_of_arr - 2`, and `ans[i + 1]` is already set to `ans[i + 1] + ans[i]`. This means `ans[i + 1]` has been updated, but the condition that `ans[length_of_arr - 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[length_of_arr - 1]` remains unchanged.
