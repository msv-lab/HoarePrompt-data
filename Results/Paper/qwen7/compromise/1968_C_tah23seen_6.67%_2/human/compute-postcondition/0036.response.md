Output State: `i` is 1; `ans[1]` is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`; `ans[2]` is equal to `ans[1]` and `ans[3]` is `ans[2] + ans[2]`; `ans[4]` is `ans[3] + ans[3]`.

In this final output state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the value of `i` remains 1 as it was incremented within the loop condition but never used post-loop. The array `ans` is constructed such that each element from `ans[2]` onwards is twice the previous element, starting from `ans[1]`, which is the sum of `arr[0]` and `ans[0]`. This pattern continues until the loop condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` no longer holds true.
