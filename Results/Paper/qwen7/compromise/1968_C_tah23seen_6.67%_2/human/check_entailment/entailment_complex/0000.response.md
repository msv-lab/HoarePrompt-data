Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program and the provided function `func_1` to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find an array \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).
2. \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).

Given the constraints and the nature of the modulo operation, we need to ensure that each \(a_i\) is chosen such that the modulo condition holds true.

### Function Analysis:
The function `func_1` attempts to construct the array \(a\) based on the given array \(x\). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`: This sets the first element of the result array to be one more than the first element of the input array.
   
2. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - For each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-2\):
     - `ans[i+1] = arr[i] + ans[i]`: This tries to set the next element in the result array to be the sum of the current element in the input array and the previous element in the result array.
     - If `ans[i+1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i+1]`, it adjusts `ans[i+1]` by repeatedly adding `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i+1]`.

3. **Final Adjustment**:
   - `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]`: This sets the last element of the result array to be the sum of the second last element of the result array and the last element of the input array.

### Verification:
To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Example Input:
```
4
2 4 1
```

#### Expected Output:
```
3 5 4 9
```

#### Step-by-Step Execution:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans = [0, 0, 0]`
   - `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`

2. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - `i = 0`:
     - `ans[1] = arr[0] + ans[0] = 2 + 3 = 5`
   - `i = 1`:
     - `ans[2] = arr[1] + ans[1] = 4 + 5 = 9`
     - Since `9 > 1`, no adjustment is needed.

3. **Final Adjustment**:
   - `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1] = 9 + 1 = 10`

However, the expected output is `3 5 4 9`, which suggests that the function might have a flaw in its logic. Let's re-evaluate the logic:

- The function should ensure that each \(a_i\) is chosen such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).
- The current logic does not guarantee that the modulo condition is met for all \(i\).

### Conclusion:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the modulo condition is satisfied for all \(i\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
