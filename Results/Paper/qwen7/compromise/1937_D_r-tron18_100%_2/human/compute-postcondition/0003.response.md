Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0.**

Explanation: The line `suffZero = [0]` initializes a new list `suffZero` with a single element, which is 0. This does not affect the values of `totalOne`, `s1`, `pre`, or `preOne`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
