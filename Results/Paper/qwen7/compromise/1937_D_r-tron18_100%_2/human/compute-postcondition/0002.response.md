Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with 0.**

Explanation:
- `totalOne` remains unchanged and is still equal to the length of `pre`.
- `s1` and `pre` remain unchanged.
- `preOne` is created using `list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))`. This means that `preOne` starts with 0 (due to `initial=0`) and then accumulates the values in `pre`. For example, if `pre = [2, 4, 6]`, then `preOne` would be `[0, 2, 6, 12]`.
