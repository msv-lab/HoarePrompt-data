Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `a` contains the element `i`, and `i` is the next element in `s`.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be the next element in the sequence `s`. Since `i` was the next element in `s` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will now be the element after that in `s`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` will now contain the next element in `s`.
   - The variable `a` will contain the current value of `i` from the previous iteration.

Based on the above steps, the updated states are:

- `a` contains the element `i` from the previous iteration.
- `i` is now the next element in `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `a` contains the element `i` from the previous iteration, `i` is the next element in `s`**. 

To be more precise, if we denote the current element in `s` as `next_i`, then:

**State: `a` contains the element `i`, `i` is `next_i`**.

However, since the exact value of `next_i` is not specified, we can generalize it as:

**State: `a` contains the element `i`, `i` is the next element in `s`**.
