Postcondition: **The set `a` now contains all unique characters from the string `s`, and the variables `i`, `t`, and `isreverse` remain unchanged; `isreverse` is the reversed version of the string `s`. The new string `newstr` is equal to the original string `s`, and `isreverse` is either not equal to `s` or equal to `s`.**
