Output State: **`s` is now the original `s` without leading or trailing spaces, `i` is the second character of the new `s`, `a` is an empty set, and `isreverse` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty set `a`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `i`, or `isreverse`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states. The only change is that `a` is now an empty set.
