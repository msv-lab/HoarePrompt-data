Output State: **`s` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `i` is the second-to-last character of the new `s`, `a` is an empty set, `t` is reduced by 1, and `isreverse` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `a = set()` creates an empty set and assigns it to the variable `a`. All other variables (`s`, `i`, `t`, and `isreverse`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
