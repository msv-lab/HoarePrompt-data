Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Calculation**:
   - If `n` is odd (`n % 2 == 1`):
     - It checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying one yogurt at the regular price (`a`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper, so it calculates the cost as `a * n`.
       - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a` (buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining one at the regular price).
   - If `n` is even (`n % 2 == 0`):
     - It directly checks if buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`2 * a`) is cheaper than buying one yogurt at the regular price (`a`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying all yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper, so it calculates the cost as `a * n`.
       - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b` (buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly.
   - The program accounts for the scenario where the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than the regular price for one yogurt.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Verification with Example Input:

Let's verify the program with the provided example input:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is even, it checks `2 * a < b`. Here, `2 * 5 = 10` and `10 > 9`, so it uses the promotion price.
  - Cost: `2 * 9 = 18` (but the program outputs `9` because it incorrectly assumes the promotion is always used when `n` is even).

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd, it checks `2 * a < b`. Here, `2 * 5 = 10` and `10 > 9`, so it uses the promotion price for two yogurts and the regular price for one.
  - Cost: `1 * 5 + 1 * 9 = 14` (program outputs `14`).

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd, it checks `2 * a < b`. Here, `2 * 5 = 10` and `10 < 11`, so it uses the promotion price for two yogurts and the regular price for one.
  - Cost: `1 * 5 + 1 * 11 = 16` (program outputs `15`).

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even, it checks `2 * a < b`. Here, `2 * 5 = 10` and `10 < 11`, so it uses the promotion price for all yogurts.
  - Cost: `4 * 5 = 20` (program outputs `20`).

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the case where the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than the regular price for one yogurt correctly for even `n`. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes the promotion is always used when `n` is even, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
