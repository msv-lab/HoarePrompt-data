Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not always give the correct answer. The problem requires finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles such that each pile contains at least one book. However, the current implementation simply adds the pages of the two books with the highest page counts, which does not guarantee the maximum possible total.

To solve this correctly, we need to consider all possible ways to split the books into two piles and find the combination that gives the maximum sum of the highest books in each pile. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        max_pages = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Calculate the sum of the top i books and the sum of the remaining books
            current_sum = sum(nums[:i]) + nums[i]
            max_pages = max(max_pages, current_sum)
        results.append(max_pages)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program iterates through all possible ways to split the books into two piles and calculates the maximum total number of pages Alice can read.
