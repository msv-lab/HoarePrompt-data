Reasoning:
- The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page numbers `nums`.
- It sorts the list of page numbers in descending order, which is a valid approach to find the two largest numbers.
- It then prints the sum of the two largest page numbers, which is the goal of the problem.
- The function handles multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.
- There are no logical errors or missing steps in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
