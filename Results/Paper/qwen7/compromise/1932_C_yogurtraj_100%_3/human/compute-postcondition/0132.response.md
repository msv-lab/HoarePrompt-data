Output State: **`i` is `n-5`, `k` is `k * a[q1] % m`, `n` must be greater than 2**

Explanation: The variable `q1` is decremented by 1. Initially, `q1` was an index used in the expression `a[q1]`. The value of `i` is updated to `n-5` because it was initially `n-4` and now it becomes `n-4-1 = n-5`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not directly affected by the operation `q1 -= 1`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
