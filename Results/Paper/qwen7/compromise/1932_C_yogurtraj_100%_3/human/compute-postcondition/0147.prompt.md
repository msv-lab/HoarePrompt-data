Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. The array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The string s is a sequence of n characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t = input()
    l = t.count('L')
    k = 0
    q1 = 0
    q2 = 0
    if t[-1] == 'L':
        k = a[l - 1] % m
        q1 = l - 2
        q2 = l
    else:
        k = a[l] % m
        q1 = l - 1
        q2 = l + 1
    y = [0] * n
    y[-1] = k
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if t[i] == 'R':
            k = k * a[q2] % m
            q2 += 1
        else:
            k = k * a[q1] % m
            q1 -= 1
        y[i] = k
    print(*y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be -1, which means the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `k` will hold the final value after all the multiplications and mod operations as per the conditions inside the loop. The list `y` will contain the values of `k` for each iteration starting from the last index down to the second index (since `y[-1]` is set to `k` in the last iteration). The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `q1`, and `q2` will remain unchanged from their last known state before the loop started.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` remains greater than 2, as it was initially. The variables `q1` and `q2` will be updated based on the sequence of 'R' and 'L' in the list `t`. Specifically, `q1` will be `l - (n - 1)` and `q2` will be `l + (n - 1)`, where `l` is the initial value derived from the conditions given in the initial state. The variable `k` will hold the final value after all multiplications and mod operations have been performed according to the instructions in the loop. The list `y` will be filled with the intermediate values of `k` starting from index `0` up to `n-1`, with each element updated according to the loop's logic.

In summary, `i` will be `-1`, `n` will still be greater than 2, `q1` and `q2` will reflect the final positions based on the sequence of 'R' and 'L' in `t`, `k` will contain the final computed value, and `y` will be a list of length `n` with each element updated during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is -1, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is the final value after all iterations based on the conditions inside the loop, `y` is a list of `n` zeros where each element from index `0` to `n-2` (inclusive) is updated to the value of `k` after each iteration, and `q1` and `q2` are adjusted according to the conditions inside the loop for each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
