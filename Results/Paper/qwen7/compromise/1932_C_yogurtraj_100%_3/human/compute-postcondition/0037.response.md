Output State: **`k` is updated to the value of `k * a[q1] % m`, `q1` is decreased by 1 to `q1 - 1`, `y[i+1]` is assigned the value of `k`, the condition `t[i+1] == 'R'` is still false.**

This means that `q1` has been decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
