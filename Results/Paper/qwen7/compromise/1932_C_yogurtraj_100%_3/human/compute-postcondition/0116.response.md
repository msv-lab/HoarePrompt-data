Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `-1`.
   - `n` is greater than `2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order. Therefore, `i` should start at `n-2` and decrement until it reaches `-1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initially `-1`, it means the loop has already started and `i` is at the end of its range. This implies that the loop has already executed at least once.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be able to decrement from `n-2` to `0` (inclusive).

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is `n-2` and `n` remains greater than `2`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 2**
