Output State: **`k` is updated to the value of `k * a[q1] % m`; `q1` is decreased by 1; `y[i+1]` is assigned the value of `k`; the condition `t[i+1] == 'R'` is still false.**

Explanation: The code updates `k` to the value of `k * a[q1] % m`. It does not affect `q2`, so `q2` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state. However, since the current line of code only updates `k` using `a[q1]`, `q1` is decreased by 1. The value of `y[i+1]` is assigned the new value of `k`. The condition `t[i+1] == 'R'` remains false as stated in the initial state.
