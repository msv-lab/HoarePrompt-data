Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `t` is the next line of input, `l` is the count of 'L' in `t`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or `a[l] % m` if `t[-1] != 'L'`, `q1` is either `l - 2` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or `l - 1` if `t[-1] != 'L'`, `q2` is either `l` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or `l + 1` if `t[-1] != 'L', `y` is a list of `n` zeros, `y[-1]` is `k`.**

Explanation: The code `y[-1] = k` updates the last element of the list `y` to the value of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
