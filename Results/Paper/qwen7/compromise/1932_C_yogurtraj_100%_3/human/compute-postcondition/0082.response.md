Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `n` is greater than 2, `q1` is decreased by 1, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, and `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`**.

Explanation: The code updates `k` to `k * a[q1] % m`, which means `k` is now the product of its previous value and `a[q1]` modulo `m`. It also decreases `q1` by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `y[i]` are updated accordingly, while the condition `n > 2` remains unchanged.
