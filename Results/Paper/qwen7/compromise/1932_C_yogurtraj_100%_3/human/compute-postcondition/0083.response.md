Output State: **`i` is `n - 4`, `n` is greater than 2, `q1` is decreased by 1, `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`, and `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`.**

Explanation: The line `q1 -= 1` decrements the value of `q1` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `y[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
