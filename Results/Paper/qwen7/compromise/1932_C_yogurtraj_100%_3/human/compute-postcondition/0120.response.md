Output State: **`k` is `k * a[q2] % m`, `i` is `n-3`, `n` must be greater than 2, and the current value of `t[i]` is 'R'.**

Explanation: The variable `q2` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `q2` to `q2 + 1`. The other variables (`k`, `i`, `n`, and the value of `t[i]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `i` is now `n-3` instead of `n-2`.
