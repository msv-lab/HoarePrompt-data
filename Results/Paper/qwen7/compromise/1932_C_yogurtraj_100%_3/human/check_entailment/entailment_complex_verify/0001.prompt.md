You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be -1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `k` will hold the final value after all the multiplications and mod operations as per the conditions inside the loop. The list `y` will contain the values of `k` for each iteration starting from the last index down to the second index (since `y[-1]` is set to `k` in the last iteration). The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `q1`, and `q2` will remain unchanged from their last known state before the loop started.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \), the modulus \( m \), an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a string \( t \) of length \( n \) consisting of 'L' and 'R'. It then calculates a sequence of values based on the direction indicated by 'L' and 'R' in \( t \) and stores these values in a list \( y \). The final list \( y \) is printed, where each element \( y[i] \) represents the product of certain elements in \( a \) modulo \( m \), depending on the direction specified by \( t \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `a` and the string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes variables `l`, `k`, `q1`, and `q2`.
   - The variable `l` is set to the count of 'L' commands in the string `s`.
   - `k` is initialized to the product of the first `l-1` elements of `a` modulo `m` if the last command is 'L', or the `l`-th element modulo `m` if the last command is 'R'.
   - `q1` and `q2` are initialized to help track the indices for the product calculation.

3. **Result Array Initialization:**
   - An array `y` of size `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - The last element of `y` is set to `k`.

4. **Product Calculation Loop:**
   - The loop iterates backward through the array `a` from the second last element to the first.
   - If the current command is 'R', it updates `k` by multiplying it with the next element in `a` modulo `m` and increments `q2`.
   - If the current command is 'L', it updates `k` by multiplying it with the previous element in `a` modulo `m` and decrements `q1`.
   - The updated `k` is stored in the corresponding position in `y`.

5. **Output:**
   - The result array `y` is printed.

### Correctness Check

1. **Handling of 'L' and 'R':**
   - The logic for handling 'L' and 'R' commands is correct. It correctly updates the product and adjusts the indices `q1` and `q2` accordingly.

2. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation is performed correctly at each step to ensure the product remains within the bounds of `m`.

3. **Order of Operations:**
   - The program processes the commands in the order they appear in the string `s`, which is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the last command is 'L' or 'R' correctly by setting `k` appropriately.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the program, it appears that the logic is correct and matches the problem description. The program correctly processes the commands and computes the required remainders.
