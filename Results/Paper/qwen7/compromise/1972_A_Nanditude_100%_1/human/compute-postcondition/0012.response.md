Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and the condition `b[j] >= a[i]` holds true, `i` is increased by 1.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial conditions and the value of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition `b[j] >= a[i]` still holds true (as it did before the increment), these details are preserved in the output state.
