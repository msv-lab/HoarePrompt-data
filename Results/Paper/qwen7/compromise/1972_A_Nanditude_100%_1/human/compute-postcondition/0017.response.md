Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition `if b[j] < a[i]` and the assignment `cnt = 1` are not executed because the code snippet only contains the line `i += 1`.
