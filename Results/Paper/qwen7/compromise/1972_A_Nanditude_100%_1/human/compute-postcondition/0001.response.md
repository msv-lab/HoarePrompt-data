State: **`t` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the range parameter.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
- Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- The initial value of `t` being an integer between 1 and 100 ensures that `t` is indeed greater than 0, but we need to explicitly state this condition to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
