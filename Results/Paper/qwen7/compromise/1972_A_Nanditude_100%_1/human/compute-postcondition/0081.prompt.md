Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(n):
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `cnt` is the count of elements in list `b` that are less than the element `a[i]`. If all elements in `b` have been processed (i.e., `j` equals `n`), then `i` will be equal to the number of times `i` was incremented during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `cnt` is either 0 or `j` (depending on the values in lists `a` and `b`), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user.

After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be 2 if no element in list `b` was found such that `b[j] < a[i]` for any `j` from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `i` will be 1. The variable `j` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `j` in each iteration until it reaches `n`. The variable `cnt` will be either 0 or `j` depending on how many times the condition `b[j] < a[i]` was met during the loop's execution. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is a value within the range [0, n], `j` is a value within the range [0, n - 1], `cnt` is equal to the number of times `b[j]` was found to be less than `a[i]` during the loop's execution, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be a value between 0 and `n` inclusive, `j` will be a value between 0 and `n-1` inclusive, and `cnt` will hold the total count of elements in the list `b` that are less than the current value of `a[i]`. The list `b` itself remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
