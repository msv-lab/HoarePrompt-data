The function processes a list of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and two strings representing the first and second rows of a grid. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to move from the first row to the second row following the directions of the arrows (`<` or `>`). If such a path exists, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. The function returns a list of 'YES' and 'NO' values based on the outcome for each test case.
