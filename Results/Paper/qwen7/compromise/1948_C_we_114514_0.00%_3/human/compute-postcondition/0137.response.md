Postcondition: `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True or False based on the condition `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, `reachable_first_row` is False, and the value of `row2[j]` remains '>', and `j` is `previous_j + 1` where `previous_j` was the value of `j` in the previous iteration. If `j` equals `n - 1`, the condition is met and no changes occur.
