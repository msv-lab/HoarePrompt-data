Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_case` is split into `n` and a tuple `(row1, row2)`, `reachable_first_row` is True.**

Explanation: The code only assigns `True` to the variable `reachable_first_row`. It does not affect the values of `results` or `test_case`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state with `reachable_first_row` set to `True`.
