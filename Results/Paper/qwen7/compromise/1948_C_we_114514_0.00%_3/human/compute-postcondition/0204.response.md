Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `reachable_second_row` is updated based on specific conditions involving `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`.
   - Other variables (`n`, `test_case`, `row1`, `row2`) are updated accordingly.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `reachable_second_row` will be checked against the new value of `j` (which is `j + 1`).
   - The other variables (`n`, `test_case`, `row1`, `row2`) remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

Given this information, let's formulate the state for the start of the next iteration:

- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `reachable_second_row` will be updated based on the new value of `j` (i.e., `j + 1`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State:**
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `reachable_second_row` is updated based on the conditions provided, using `j + 1` instead of `j`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `reachable_second_row` is updated based on the conditions provided using `j + 1`**.
