Postcondition: `results` is an empty list, `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is either False or remains unchanged, and `j` is `n`. Since the if condition `j == n - 1` does not match (as `j` is `n`), the else part does not execute, and the conditions remain as they were initially.
