Output State: **`results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected, and the precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains unchanged. Each test case in `test_cases` is a list containing three elements: an integer \(n\) (2 \(\leq\) \(n\) \(\leq\) 2 \(*\) \(10^5\) and \(n\) is even), and two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid, where each string consists of exactly \(n\) characters that are either '<' or '>' indicating the direction of the arrow in each cell. After executing the given line of code, the only change is that `results` is now an empty list.
