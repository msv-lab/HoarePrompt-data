Postcondition: `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` states are determined based on the value of `j` and `row2[j]`. If `j` equals `n - 1`, the condition is met and no changes occur. If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is set to True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains False.
