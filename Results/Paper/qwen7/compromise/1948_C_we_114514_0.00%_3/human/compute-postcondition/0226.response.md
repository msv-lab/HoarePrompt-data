Output State: **reachable_second_row is True, j is equal to n, test_case is ['NO'], row1 is an empty list, row2 is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` adds the string 'NO' to the `results` list, which is referred to as `test_case` in the output state. The values of `reachable_second_row`, `j`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
