Output State: **`reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `j` is `previous_j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `reachable_first_row` stays `False`, and `j` remains `previous_j + 1`.
