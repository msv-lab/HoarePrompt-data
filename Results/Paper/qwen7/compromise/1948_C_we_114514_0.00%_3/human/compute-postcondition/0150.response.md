Output State: **`results` is a list containing ['YES', 'NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `j` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contains `['NO']`. After appending `'YES'`, `results` becomes `['NO', 'YES']`. The other variables (`reachable_second_row`, `reachable_first_row`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
