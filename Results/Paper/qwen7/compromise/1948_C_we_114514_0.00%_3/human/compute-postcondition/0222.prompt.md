Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is False, `reachable_first_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n`, `test_case` is updated to contain the next element in `test_cases`, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `row1` is the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of `test_case`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is less than `n`, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `test_case` is updated to contain the next element in `test_cases`, `row1` is the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the updated second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`. If `row1[j]` is '>', and either `j` equals `n - 1` or the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is incremented by 1, `reachable_second_row` is updated based on the following conditions: if `row1[j] == '>'`, then `reachable_second_row` is `True`. If `row1[j] != '>'` and `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>', then `reachable_second_row` is `False`. Otherwise, `reachable_second_row` remains unchanged based on the original conditions provided. Other variables (`n`, `test_case`, `row1`, `row2`) are updated accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `reachable_second_row` is True if `row1[j]` is '>', and `j` is either equal to `n - 1` or incremented to `n - 1` if `row1[j]` is not '>.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
