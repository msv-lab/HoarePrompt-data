Output State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, and the value of `row2[j]` remains '>' regardless of whether the condition `reachable_second_row` is true or false, and `j` is `previous_j + 1` where `previous_j` was the value of `j` in the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code simply sets `reachable_second_row` to True. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `results`, `reachable_first_row`, `row2[j]`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
