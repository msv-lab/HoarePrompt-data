Postcondition: `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` and `(row1, row2)` are assigned from `test_case`, `j` is less than `n`, and the current value of `row1[j]` is '>', since the condition `j == n - 1` evaluates to true, making `reachable_second_row` True.
