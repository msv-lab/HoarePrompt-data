Output State: **reachable_first_row is False, reachable_second_row is True, j is equal to n, (n and (row1, row2)) are assigned from test_case, j is less than n - 1, and row2[j] is equal to '>'**.

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
