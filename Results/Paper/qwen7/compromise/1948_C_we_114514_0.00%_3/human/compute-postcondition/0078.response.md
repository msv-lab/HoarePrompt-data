State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` and `(row1, row2)` are assigned from `test_case`, `j` must be less than `n`**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `j` is used in the `range(n)` function, meaning the loop will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `j < n` must be true at the start of the loop.
3. The initial state shows that `j` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `j` must be adjusted to be less than `n` for the loop to start executing.
4. Other variables (`results`, `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, `n`, `test_case`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to be less than `n`.
