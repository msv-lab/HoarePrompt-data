Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low <= high`.
2. **Determine the current state of the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `low` is currently 0.
   - `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `low <= high` must be true.
   - Given that `low` is 0, the loop will execute as long as `high` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Analyze the state of `high`**:
   - `high` is defined as the minimum of `n` and `b`.
   - Since `high` is the minimum of two values (`n` and `b`), it can be either positive, zero, or negative depending on the values of `n` and `b`.

5. **Determine if any adjustments are needed**:
   - If `high` is already greater than or equal to 0, no adjustment is necessary.
   - If `high` is less than 0, then the loop cannot execute the first time because `low` (which is 0) would not satisfy the condition `low <= high`.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for `n` and `b`, we assume the worst-case scenario where `high` could be less than 0. To ensure the loop can execute the first time, `high` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 0.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to ensure `high` is greater than or equal to 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b` and `high` must be greater than or equal to 0**
