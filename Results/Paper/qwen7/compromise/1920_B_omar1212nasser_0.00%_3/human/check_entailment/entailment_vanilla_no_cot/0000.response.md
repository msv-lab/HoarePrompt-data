Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Hardcoded Condition**: The function `func_2` has a hardcoded condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0`. This condition should not be hardcoded; instead, the logic should dynamically handle the optimal strategy based on the values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Positive Elements Calculation**: The logic used to calculate the maximum possible sum is flawed. Specifically, the way positive elements are being considered and subtracted is incorrect. The goal is to maximize the sum by considering the best combination of removals and negations, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The solution does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it does not properly account for the optimal strategy when `removals` and `negatives` are different from the hardcoded values.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following steps:

1. **Sort the Array**: Sort the array to easily manage the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Optimal Removal Strategy**: Alice should remove the smallest elements to minimize the negative impact on the sum.
3. **Optimal Negation Strategy**: Bob should negate the smallest negative elements to minimize the sum further.
4. **Calculate the Result**: After applying the optimal strategies, calculate the final sum.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes the smallest k elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob negates the smallest x elements
        a[:x] = [-el if el > 0 else el for el in a[:x]]
        
        # Calculate the final sum
        result = sum(a)
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

This approach ensures that the solution is dynamic and handles all cases correctly without relying on hardcoded conditions.
