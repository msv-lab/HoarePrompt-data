The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers representing the array elements.

The function has two possible return values:
- Case_1: The function returns 0.
- Case_2: The function returns the value of `pos[0]` which is the original `s - 2 * original n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`, and return either 0 or the value of `pos[0]` (which is `s - 2 * original n`) based on the operations Alice and Bob can perform on the list `elements`.
