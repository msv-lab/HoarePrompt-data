Output State: `removals`: 0, `negatives`: 0, `elements`: any list of integers, `pos`: [s - 2 * n], `s`: sum of all elements in `elements`, `n`: sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.

Explanation: The loop runs from 1 to `removals` (inclusive), but since `removals` is initially 0, the loop body never gets executed. Therefore, the values of `s`, `n`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial states.
