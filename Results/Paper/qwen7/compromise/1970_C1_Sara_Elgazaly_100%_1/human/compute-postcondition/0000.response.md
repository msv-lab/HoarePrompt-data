Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial state.
