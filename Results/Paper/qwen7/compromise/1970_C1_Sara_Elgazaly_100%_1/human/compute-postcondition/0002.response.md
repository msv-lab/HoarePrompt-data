Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists, `rev` is a defaultdict where all values are lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new defaultdict named `rev` where all values are lists. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `x`, `y`, `lst`). Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with the addition of the new `rev` variable.
