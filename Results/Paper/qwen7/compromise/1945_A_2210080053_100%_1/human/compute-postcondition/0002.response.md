Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a', b', and c' such that 0 ≤ a', b', c' ≤ 10^9, where for each test case:
- b' = b + c (b is the original value of b before the loop)
- a' = a - floor((-b) / 3) if c >= b % 3, otherwise a' = a - floor((-b - 1) / 3)

This output state describes the final values of a, b, and c after executing the loop for all test cases. The value of b is updated by adding c to it, and the value of a is adjusted based on the division of -b by 3, taking into account the remainder when dividing c by 3.
