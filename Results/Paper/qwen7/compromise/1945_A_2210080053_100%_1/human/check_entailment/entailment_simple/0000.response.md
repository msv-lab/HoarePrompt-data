Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads each test case from standard input and splits the input string into integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Adjusting Extroverts and Universals**: The line `b += c` adjusts the count of extroverts (`b`) by adding the count of universals (`c`). This adjustment is based on the assumption that each universal can fill the remaining spots in a tent if possible.

3. **Calculating Tents**: The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` calculates the number of tents needed:
   - `b // 3` gives the number of full tents that can be filled with 3 people (either extroverts or universals).
   - `-b // 3` negates this value, effectively giving `-b // 3` as the number of full tents minus the ceiling division result.
   - `a - -b // 3` subtracts the number of full tents from the number of introverts, which gives the number of tents needed for introverts after accounting for full tents.
   - The condition `[c < b % 3]` checks if there are more universals than the remainder when `b` is divided by 3. If true, it outputs `-1` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `c < b % 3`, it means there are more universals than the remainder spots, making it impossible to accommodate everyone, hence `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the calculation is correct as it accounts for all participants' preferences.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of tents required while handling edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
