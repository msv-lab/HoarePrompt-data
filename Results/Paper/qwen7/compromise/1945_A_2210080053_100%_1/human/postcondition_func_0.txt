The function processes a series of test cases, each containing the counts of introverts (a), extroverts (b), and universals (c). For each test case, it calculates the adjusted count of introverts based on the number of extroverts and universals, and prints the result. Specifically, it computes the adjusted introverts count as \(a - \left\lfloor\frac{b + c}{3}\right\rfloor\) if the remainder when \(b + c\) is divided by 3 is less than or equal to the number of universals, otherwise it uses \(a - \left\lfloor\frac{b}{3}\right\rfloor\). The function outputs this adjusted count for each test case.
