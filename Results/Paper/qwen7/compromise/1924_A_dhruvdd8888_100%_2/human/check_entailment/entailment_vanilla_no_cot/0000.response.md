Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is not correctly implemented**: The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed.
   
   - The code attempts to find the first occurrence of each character in `us` (which is a set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets) in the string `s`, but it doesn't ensure that all combinations of these characters form subsequences.
   
2. **Logic for checking subsequences is incomplete**: The current implementation only checks for the presence of the first occurrence of each character in `s` and doesn't account for the sequence of characters needed to form all possible strings of length `n`.

3. **Incorrect handling of output**: If the program determines that not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`, it incorrectly prints the first string found that is missing from `win` instead of generating a string that is guaranteed not to be a subsequence.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    all_combinations = [''.join(p) for p in itertools.product(us, repeat=n)]
    
    # Check if all combinations are subsequences
    for combination in all_combinations:
        if not is_subsequence(combination, s):
            print('NO')
            print(combination)
            return
    print('YES')

def is_subsequence(sub, main):
    it = iter(main)
    return all(c in it for c in sub)

# Main loop
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

### Key Changes:
- **Use of `itertools.product`**: Generates all possible combinations of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- **Function `is_subsequence`**: Checks if a given string `sub` is a subsequence of `main`.
- **Correct Output Handling**: Ensures that if any combination is not a subsequence, it prints `NO` followed by the combination, otherwise prints `YES`.

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly checks and outputs the required results based on the problem statement.
