Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` which iterates over the set `us`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the set `us`, it must be initialized to the first element of `us` before the loop starts.

3. **Understand the set `us`**: The set `us` contains the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a'. Therefore, `us = {'a', 'b', ..., 'a' + (k-1)}`.

4. **Initial value of `i`**: For the loop to start executing, `i` must be the first element of `us`, which is 'a'.

5. **Other variables**: The other variables (`ps`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `win`, `ans`) do not affect the loop's execution and remain unchanged as per the given state.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i` to be the first element of `us`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 'a'**
