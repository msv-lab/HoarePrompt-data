Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and `s` is the input string; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a'.**

Explanation: The code creates a set `us` that contains the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, starting from 'a'. For example, if `k` is 5, `us` would be {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged.
