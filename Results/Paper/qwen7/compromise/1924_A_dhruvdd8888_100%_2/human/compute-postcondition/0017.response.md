Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \(n\), \(k\), and \(m\), and a string \(s\) of length \(m\) consisting of the first \(k\) lowercase English alphabets. It checks if there are at least \(n\) substrings of length \(k\) within \(s\) that contain only characters from the first \(k\) lowercase English alphabets. If such substrings are found, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it determines and prints a specific character sequence based on the remaining characters needed to meet the condition.**
