Output State: **`a` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code modifies the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. Given that `i` is 1, `b[i]` refers to `b[1]`. Therefore, `b[i + 1]` refers to `b[2]`. The value of `b[2]` is updated to `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged.
