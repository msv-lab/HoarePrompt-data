Output State: **`b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` decreases the value of `b[i + 2]` by the value of `b[i]`. The other conditions (`b[i + 1]` being decreased by `2 * b[i]` and `i` being `i + 1`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are as described.
