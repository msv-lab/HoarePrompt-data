Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` must be at least 2, and `i` is 1; `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` updates the value of `b[i + 2]` by subtracting `b[i]` from it. Given that `i` is 1, this means `b[3]` (since `i + 2` equals 3) is updated by subtracting `b[1]` from it. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
