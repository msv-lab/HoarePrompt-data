Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`: This means that `i` is incremented by 1. However, since the exact initial value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` after it is incremented. But we know that `i` has been incremented by 1.
- `b[i]` is `0`: This means that the element at index `i` in the list `b` is set to 0.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
