Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9; the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = int(input())
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(0, a - 2):
        if b[i] < 0:
            print('NO')
            break
        b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
        b[i + 2] -= b[i]
        b[i] -= b[i]
    else:
        if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 5, `i` is equal to `a - 2`, `b[3]` is 0, `b[4]` is equal to `-6 * (a-5)`, `b[5]` is equal to `-6 * (a-5)`, and all elements `b[i]` for `i` from 0 to 2 are 0.

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. Given that the loop runs from `0` to `a-3` (since `a-2` is the upper limit), it will iterate `a-2` times. After these iterations, all elements `b[i]` for `i` from 0 to 2 are set to 0, and the value of `b[3]` onwards depends on the value of `a`. Specifically, `b[4]` and `b[5]` are both `-6 * (a-5)` because each iteration subtracts the previous element's value twice from the next one and once from the one after that, starting from `b[0]` down to `b[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: All elements in the list `b` are 0.

Explanation: Given the conditions and the operations performed within the loop, after each iteration, the value of `b[i]` becomes 0. Since the loop continues as long as `b[i]` is non-negative, once `b[i]` becomes 0, it will remain 0 for subsequent iterations. The loop updates `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]` based on the value of `b[i]`, but since `b[i]` is 0, these updates do not change the values of `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]`. Therefore, after all iterations, all elements in the list `b` will be 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `a` is greater than 5, `i` is 3, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 2]` is `b[4] - b[1]`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations (4 times), `a` must be greater than 5 because the loop runs from `0` to `a-2`, so `a-2 = 3` implies `a > 5`. The value of `i` will be 3 since the loop increments `i` each iteration. At the end of the loop, `b[i]` (which is `b[3]`) is set to 0. Additionally, `b[i + 2]` (which is `b[5]` or `b[4]` based on zero-indexing) is updated by subtracting `b[1]` from it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
