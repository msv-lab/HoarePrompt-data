Based on the initial state provided:

- `b[i]` is 0.
- `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`. Since `b[i]` is 0, `2 * b[i]` is also 0, so `b[i + 1]` remains unchanged.
- `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`. Again, since `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 2]` remains unchanged.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

After these operations, the values of the relevant parts of the list `b` remain as follows:
- `b[i]` is still 0.
- `b[i + 1]` is unchanged from its original value.
- `b[i + 2]` is unchanged from its original value.

However, the print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'` without referencing any of the variables `b[i]`, `b[i + 1]`, or `b[i + 2]`.

Output: **NO**
