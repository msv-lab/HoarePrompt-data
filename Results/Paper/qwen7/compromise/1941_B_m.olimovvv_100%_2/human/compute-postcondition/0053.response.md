Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b[i]` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block that `i` and `b[i]` are part of. The values of `i` and `b[i]` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
