Output State: **`b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, effectively setting `b[i]` to 0. The values of `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` are not directly affected by this line of code, so they retain their original relationships as specified in the initial state.
