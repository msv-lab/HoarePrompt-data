Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is the integer entered by the user, `power` is 1.**

The code simply reassigns the variable `power` to the value 1, without affecting the values of `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
