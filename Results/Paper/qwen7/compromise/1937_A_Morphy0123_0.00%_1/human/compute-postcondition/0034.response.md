Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than 16, `power` is 5.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` by 1 until it is no longer less than the value of `log2(n)`. After each iteration, `power` increases by 1. Given that `power` is 4 after 3 iterations, it will be incremented to 5 after the 4th iteration. For the loop to execute 4 times, `n` must be greater than \(2^4 = 16\). Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `power` will be 5 and `n` must be greater than 16.
