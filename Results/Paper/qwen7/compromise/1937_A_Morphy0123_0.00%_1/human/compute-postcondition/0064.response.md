Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `power` is set to 5 if `n == 15`, otherwise `power` is 4 if `n != 15` and `n >= 16`, or `power` is at least 3 and does not equal `n` if `n < 16`**.
