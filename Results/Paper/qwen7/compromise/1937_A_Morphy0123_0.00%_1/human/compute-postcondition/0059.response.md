Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 16, `power` is greater than or equal to 3, and `power` is not equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `power` is decremented by 1, changing its value from at least 4 to at least 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
