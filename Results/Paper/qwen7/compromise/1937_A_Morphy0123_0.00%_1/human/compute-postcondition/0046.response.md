Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is an input integer and must be greater than 2.
- `i` is set to 2.
- `n` is an integer entered by the user.
- `power` is set to 5 if `n == 15`, otherwise `power` is set to 4.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print(1)
```

This statement will print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
