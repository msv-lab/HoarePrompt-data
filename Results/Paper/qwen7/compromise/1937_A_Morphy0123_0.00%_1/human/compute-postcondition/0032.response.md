Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`.
   
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is the input integer.
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - `power` is 3.

3. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   For the loop to execute again, the condition `power < log2(n)` must be true. Given that `power` is currently 3, the loop will continue if `log2(n) > 3`.

4. **Calculate the Threshold for `log2(n)`:**
   - We need `log2(n) > 3`.
   - Solving for `n`, we get \( n > 2^3 = 8 \).

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `n` must be greater than 4 and now we need `n` to be greater than 8 to satisfy the loop condition, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 8.
   - No other states need adjustment as they are not part of the loop head condition.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 3**
