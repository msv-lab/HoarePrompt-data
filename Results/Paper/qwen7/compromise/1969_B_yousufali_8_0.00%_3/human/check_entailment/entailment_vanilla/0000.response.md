### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is defined as the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, which is not consistent with the problem statement where the input should be a binary string.
   - It converts the input list to a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`, which is incorrect because the input should be a single binary string, not a list of integers.
   - The logic inside the loop is flawed. It increments `n` when it encounters a `1` and adds `n + 1` to `ans` when it encounters a `0`. This does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, `func_1` is incorrectly implemented as explained above.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the positions where the binary string changes from `1` to `0` and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to move all `1`s to the beginning and all `0`s to the end.
   - We need to find the longest prefix that is sorted and then calculate the cost of shifting the remaining part to its correct position.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
