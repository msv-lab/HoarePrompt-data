Reasoning:
- The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring that is shifted.
- The provided code only defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` reads a list of integers (which should be a binary string converted to a list of integers) and calculates the cost of sorting the string using a different method (not cyclic shifts). This method counts the segments of consecutive 1s and adds 1 for each segment of 0s. However, this approach does not correctly calculate the cost of cyclic shifts.
- `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case. It does not implement the logic to perform cyclic shifts or calculate the correct cost.
- The problem description specifies that we need to use cyclic shifts, but the provided functions do not implement this logic. Instead, they use an incorrect method to calculate the cost.
- Given the execution summaries, `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
