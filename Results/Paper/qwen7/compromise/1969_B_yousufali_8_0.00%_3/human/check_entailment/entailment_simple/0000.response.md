Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, `func_1` is designed to handle a single test case but does not account for the cyclic shifts required to sort the string.
3. `func_1` simply counts the number of consecutive 1's plus one for each segment of 0's, which is not related to the problem of sorting the string via cyclic shifts.
4. The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` does not match the problem requirements. It fails to consider the necessary operations to achieve the sorted state through cyclic shifts.

Correctness: **False**
