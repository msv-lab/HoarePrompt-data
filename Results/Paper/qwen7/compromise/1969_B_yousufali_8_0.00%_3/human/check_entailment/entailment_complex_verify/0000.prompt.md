You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the count of consecutive 1's plus one for each segment of 0's in the list `s`. `n` is 0.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a list of integers (0s and 1s) from user input, counts the number of consecutive 1s and adds 1 for each segment of 0s in the list, and prints the total count.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, the input is a binary string s (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2⋅10^5) representing the string that needs to be sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: t test cases have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a specified number of test cases (`t`). For each test case, it takes a binary string `s` as input (with a length between 2 and 2⋅10^5), sorts the string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts, and does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to handle the input as a list of integers, but the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string. Additionally, the logic in `func_1` does not account for the cyclic shifts required to sort the binary string in non-descending order.

For example, consider the input string "101011":
- The program would split the input into a list of integers `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`.
- It then counts the number of zeros followed by ones and adds the cost, which results in an incorrect output.

A correct approach would involve identifying the longest prefix of zeros and the longest suffix of ones, and then calculating the cost based on the positions of these segments. The provided code does not handle this logic, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
