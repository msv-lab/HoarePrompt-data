Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to handle the input as a list of integers, but the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string. Additionally, the logic in `func_1` does not account for the cyclic shifts required to sort the binary string in non-descending order.

For example, consider the input string "101011":
- The program would split the input into a list of integers `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]`.
- It then counts the number of zeros followed by ones and adds the cost, which results in an incorrect output.

A correct approach would involve identifying the longest prefix of zeros and the longest suffix of ones, and then calculating the cost based on the positions of these segments. The provided code does not handle this logic, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
