Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\); the length of the list is \(n\); with \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\); `freq` is a list of zeros of length \(n+1\).**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `freq` with a length of \(n+1\) and fills it with zeros. This does not affect the values of `arr`. Therefore, the initial state of `arr` remains unchanged, and `freq` is now a list of zeros with a length of \(n+1\).
