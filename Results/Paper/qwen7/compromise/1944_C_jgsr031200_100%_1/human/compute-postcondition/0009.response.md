Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers and checks if all elements in the list are unique within the given range. It creates a frequency list to count occurrences of each element. If it finds any element with a frequency of 1 or 0, it prints and breaks from the loop. If no such element is found, it continues checking until the end. The function does not explicitly return a value but may print elements based on their frequencies.**
