Reasoning:
The annotated program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not accurately determine the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. Instead, it attempts to find the first number with a frequency of 1 or 0 in the frequency list `freq`, which is not relevant to the game's outcome.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following points:
1. Alice always picks an element from `a` and appends it to `c`.
2. Bob always picks an element from `a` and removes it.
3. Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, and Bob wants to minimize it.

Given these points, the optimal strategy involves Alice ensuring that the smallest missing number (MEX) is maximized, and Bob tries to minimize it. This can be achieved by understanding how many times each number appears in the array and how the turns affect the MEX.

Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:
1. Count the frequency of each number in the array.
2. Determine how many numbers are picked by Alice and Bob.
3. Calculate the MEX based on the counts and the turns.

Let's correct the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    freq = [0] * n
    for num in arr:
        freq[num] += 1
    
    # Alice picks first, so she can pick any number, and Bob will pick next.
    # We need to ensure that the smallest number not present in c is maximized.
    
    mex = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if freq[i] % 2 == 1:  # If the number appears an odd number of times
            mex = i + 1
            break
    
    print(mex)
```

Explanation:
- We count the frequency of each number in the array using `freq`.
- Since Alice goes first, she can pick any number, and Bob will pick next. To maximize the MEX, Alice should aim to pick numbers that would leave the smallest missing number.
- We iterate through the frequency list and check for the first number that appears an odd number of times. This ensures that the smallest number not present in `c` is maximized.

Given this corrected logic, the provided function `func_1` is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
