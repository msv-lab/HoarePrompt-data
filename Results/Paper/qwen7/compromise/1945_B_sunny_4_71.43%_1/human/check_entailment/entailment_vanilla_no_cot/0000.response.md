Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m`, but it does not account for the simultaneous launches that can occur due to the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

To fix this, we need to consider the LCM of `a` and `b` to find out how often both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the LCM of a and b
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of simultaneous launches
        simultaneous_launches = int((m - 1) / lcm_ab) + 1
        # Calculate the number of individual launches for each installation
        A = int(m / a) + 1
        B = int(m / b) + 1
        # Subtract the simultaneous launches from the total to avoid double counting
        max_fireworks = A + B - simultaneous_launches
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

This corrected program takes into account the simultaneous launches and ensures that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is calculated accurately.
