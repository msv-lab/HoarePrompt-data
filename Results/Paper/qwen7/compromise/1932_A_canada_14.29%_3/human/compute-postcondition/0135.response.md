Postcondition: `thorn` is incremented by 1 if the current character `i` is '*', and it becomes 1. If `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `thorn` does not equal 2, no additional changes are made to `thorn`. If the current character `i` is not '*', `thorn` remains 0.
