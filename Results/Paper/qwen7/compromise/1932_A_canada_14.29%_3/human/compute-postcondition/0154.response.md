Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of input. Each set includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of `n` characters ('.', '@', '*') representing cells, where '.' is an empty cell, '@' is a cell with a coin, and '*' is a cell with thorns. The function returns a result for each test case, indicating the state of the cells based on the given conditions.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a string of characters, and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints and character representations.
