Output State: **`thorn` is 1**

The code `ret += 1` increments the value of `ret` by 1. Given that the initial state of `thorn` is 0, and there is no variable named `ret` mentioned in the initial state, it implies that `ret` was previously 0. After executing `ret += 1`, the value of `ret` becomes 1. Since `thorn` was initially 0 and there is no other operation affecting it, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `thorn` is 1.
