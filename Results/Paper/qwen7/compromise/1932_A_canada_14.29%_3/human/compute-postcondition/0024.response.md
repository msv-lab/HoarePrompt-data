Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s`. The variables involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the list `s`.
   - The variable `i` takes on each value from the list `s` in each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `thorn` is 1
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `len` is an input integer
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character
   - `ret` is 0
   - `i` is not equal to '@'

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is iterating through the list `s`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last character processed from the list `s`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in the list `s`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `thorn` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `len` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `s` remains the same list of characters.
   - `ret` remains 0 as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`thorn` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`**.
