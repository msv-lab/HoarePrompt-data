Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is 0, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `success` is True.**

Explanation: The line `success = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `success`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
