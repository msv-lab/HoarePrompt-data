Postcondition: **`total_bullets_used` remains 0, `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` remains less than `n`, `n` must still be greater than 0, `position` remains the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` remains the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` remains `abs(position)`, `time_available` remains equal to `distance`, and `bullets_needed` remains `health`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
