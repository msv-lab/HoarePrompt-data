Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is `n`, `position` is undefined, `health` is a list of integers converted from the input, `distance` is undefined, `time_available` is undefined, `bullets_needed` is undefined, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of all `bullets_needed` for all monsters, `t` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `healths = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `healths`. The other variables remain unchanged.
