Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is `n`, `position` is now a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `health` is a list of integers converted from the input, `distance` is undefined, `time_available` is undefined, `bullets_needed` is undefined, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of all `bullets_needed` for all monsters, `t` must be greater than 0.**

This output state reflects that the `positions` variable is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, while all other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.
