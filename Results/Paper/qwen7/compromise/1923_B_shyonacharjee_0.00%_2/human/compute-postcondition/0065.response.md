Postcondition: **`success` remains False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `position` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`, `health` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, and `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + health`. If `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` exceeds `time_available`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
