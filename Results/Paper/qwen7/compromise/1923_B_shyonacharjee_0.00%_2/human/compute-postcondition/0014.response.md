Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `n` is an input integer, `i` must be between 0 and n-1 inclusive, `position` is the position of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the i-th monster, and the total bullets used plus the bullets needed is greater than the time available.**

Explanation: The line `success = False` sets the variable `success` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
