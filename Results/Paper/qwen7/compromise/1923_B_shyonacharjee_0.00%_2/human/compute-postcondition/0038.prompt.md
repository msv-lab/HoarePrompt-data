Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total_bullets_used` is 0, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `success` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `n` is an input integer, `i` must be between 0 and n-1 inclusive, `position` is the position of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the i-th monster, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 1`, `position` is the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `health` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the `(i + 1)`-th monster, and `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `success` is still False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 2`, `position` is the first element of the `(i + 2)`-th tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the `(i + 2)`-th tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is calculated as `abs(position)`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, and `total_bullets_used` is increased by `health` and now equals the original `total_bullets_used` plus `health`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
