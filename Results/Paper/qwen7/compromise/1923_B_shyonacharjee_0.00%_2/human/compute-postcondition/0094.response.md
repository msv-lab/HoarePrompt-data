Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is 0, `success` is False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `position` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where the `break` statement is placed. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the state of the program continues as if the loop or conditional block had ended naturally.
