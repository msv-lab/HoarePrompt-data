Output State: **`success` is still False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 2`, `position` is the first element of the `(i + 2)`-th tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the `(i + 2)`-th tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is calculated as `abs(position)`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, and `total_bullets_used` is increased by `health` and now equals the original `total_bullets_used` plus `health`.**

Explanation: The code `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` increases `total_bullets_used` by the value of `bullets_needed`, which is `health`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
