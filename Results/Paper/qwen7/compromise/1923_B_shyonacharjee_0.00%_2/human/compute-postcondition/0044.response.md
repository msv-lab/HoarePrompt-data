Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is `n`, `position` is now a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `health` is a list of integers converted from the input, `distance`, `time_available`, and `bullets_needed` are undefined, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of all `bullets_needed` for all monsters, `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `monsters` list by the absolute value of their positions using the `sorted` function and a lambda function as the key. This does not affect the values of `success`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, `bullets_needed`, `total_bullets_used`, or `t`. The `monsters` list is updated to reflect the new order based on the absolute value of the positions.
