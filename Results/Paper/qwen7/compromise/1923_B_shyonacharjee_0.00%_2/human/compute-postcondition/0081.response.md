The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This means that the values of `n` and `k` are now set to the integers entered by the user. However, the values of the other variables (`success`, `monsters`, `i`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, `bullets_needed`, and `total_bullets_used`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `position` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `health` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)` of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance` of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is `health` of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of `health` for all tuples in `monsters`, `n` is the integer entered by the user, and `k` is the integer entered by the user.**
