### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. If possible, we need to output the number of stalls and their respective prices.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall.
   - We need to ensure that the total number of jewels Alice buys equals `k`.
   - We need to check if it's possible to achieve this with the given constraints.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (coins Alice has) and `k` (jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - It defines a function `func_1` to handle the logic for each test case.
   - The function checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If true, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost for the first stall (`n - k + 1`) and the second stall (`1`). Then it checks if the sum of these stalls is sufficient to buy `k` jewels.
   - If the sum is less than `k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with the calculated prices.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Case 1**: When `n == k`, the solution correctly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1.
   - **Case 2**: When `n < k`, the solution correctly prints "NO".
   - **Case 3**: When `n > k`, the solution calculates the prices for 2 stalls and checks if they can buy exactly `k` jewels. This part is logically sound but needs further validation.

5. **Validation**:
   - The logic for calculating the prices and checking if they can buy exactly `k` jewels seems correct. However, the approach might not cover all edge cases. For example, it assumes that setting up 2 stalls is always sufficient, which might not be true in all scenarios.
   - Specifically, the code does not explore other configurations of stalls that could potentially achieve the goal. For instance, it only considers two stalls, but theoretically, more stalls could be used to achieve the desired outcome.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the function correctly handles the basic cases and prints the appropriate outputs.
   - However, the annotated code also shows that the function does not consider other possible configurations of stalls. For example, if `n` is significantly larger than `k`, it might be possible to use more than 2 stalls to achieve the goal.

### Conclusion:
While the provided code correctly handles some basic cases, it does not explore all possible configurations of stalls. The solution assumes that setting up 2 stalls is always sufficient, which might not be true in all scenarios. Therefore, the code might not be correct for all possible inputs.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
