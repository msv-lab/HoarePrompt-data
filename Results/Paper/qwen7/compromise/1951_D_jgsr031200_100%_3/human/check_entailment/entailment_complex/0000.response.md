### Reasoning:

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - When \( n = k \), the function correctly prints "YES" and outputs 1 twice, indicating that no stalls are needed since Alice already has the required number of jewels.

2. **Case When \( n < k \):**
   - The function correctly prints "NO" because it's impossible for Alice to buy \( k \) jewels if she doesn't have enough coins.

3. **Case When \( n \geq k \):**
   - The function initializes the list `costs` as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It then iterates over the elements of `costs`, calculating the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall (`curr = n // i`) and updating the total count of jewels Alice buys (`h`).
   - After the loop, it checks if the total count of jewels (`h`) is at least \( k \). If not, it prints "NO".
   - If `h` is at least \( k \), it prints "YES", 2, and the elements of the list `costs`.

4. **Output Validation:**
   - The function ensures that the number of stalls used is always 2, which is within the allowed limit of 60 stalls.
   - The prices set for the stalls are valid (1 and \( n - k + 1 \)) and ensure that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the annotated program, the function correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the output meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Correctness:

**True**
