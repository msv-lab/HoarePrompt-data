Based on the initial state provided:

- `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
- `h` is the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`.
- The value of `h` is less than `k`.

Given this information, let's break down the print statement:

1. The `print('NO')` statement will print the string `'NO'`.
2. Since no other variables or objects are being printed, only the string `'NO'` will be output.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'NO'**
