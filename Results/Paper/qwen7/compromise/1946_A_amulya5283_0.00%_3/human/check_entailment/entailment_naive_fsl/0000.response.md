Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program uses a min-heap to keep track of the elements from the median index onwards and increments the smallest element until it exceeds the current median. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of operations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2
1 2
2
2 1
2
1 1
```

The expected output for these cases should be:
```
1
1
2
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
1
1
1
```

This is incorrect because for the last case `[1, 1]`, the median is `1`. To increase the median to any value greater than `1`, we need to increment both elements, which requires 2 operations. The program only increments one element, which is insufficient.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
