Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it sorts the array and determines the median index.
3. It uses a heap to keep track of the elements from the median index onwards.
4. It repeatedly increments the smallest element in the heap until all elements in the heap are greater than the median.
5. The logic to increment the smallest element in the heap and count the operations is implemented correctly.
6. The program returns the results for all test cases as expected.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem as described in the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
