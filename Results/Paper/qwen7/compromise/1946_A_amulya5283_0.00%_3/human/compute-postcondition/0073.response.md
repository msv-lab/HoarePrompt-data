Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each `a_i` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). For each test case, it returns the total number of operations performed, and finally, it returns a list named 'results' containing the total number of operations for all test cases.**
