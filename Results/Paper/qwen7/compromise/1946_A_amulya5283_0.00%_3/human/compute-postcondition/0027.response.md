Output State: **`test_cases` is used to assign its i-th element to `n` and `arr`; `arr` is sorted; `median_index` is n // 2.**

Explanation: The code calculates the `median_index` by performing integer division of `n` by 2. The value of `median_index` is now determined based on the value of `n`, but the states of `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
