Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]` with `heap` transformed into a min-heap without the smallest element, `operations` is 1, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`.**

Explanation: The code pops the smallest element from the min-heap (`heap`). This operation changes the value of the `smallest` variable to the smallest element in the heap, which is now removed from the heap. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The `operations` counter is incremented by 1 to reflect the action taken.
