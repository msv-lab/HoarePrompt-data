Output State: **`operations` is 4; `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before it was popped and incremented by 1; `heap[0]` is now the smallest element from the heap before it was popped and incremented by 2; `heap` includes the new element `smallest + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Since `operations` was initially 3, it is now 4. The other variables (`median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, `smallest`, and `heap[0]`) remain unchanged from their previous states as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
