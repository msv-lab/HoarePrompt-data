Output State: **`results` is a list containing the total number of operations performed for all test cases, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` is the last element's first value from `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the last tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index] - 3 * t`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index + 3 * t]` to the end of `arr` with each element incremented by 6 * t, `operations` is the total number of operations performed across all test cases, and `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, with `smallest + 1` being pushed onto `heap`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `results` list will contain the total number of operations performed across all test cases. The `i` variable will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. For the last test case processed, the `arr` list will be sorted, `median_index` will be `n // 2`, and `current_median` will be adjusted by subtracting `3 * t` because of the increment operations performed in each iteration. The `heap` will start from the adjusted median index and include elements incremented by `6 * t` due to the operations performed in each of the `t` iterations. The `operations` count will reflect the total number of operations across all test cases, and `smallest` and `smallest + 1` will be the values involved in the last operation of the loop.
