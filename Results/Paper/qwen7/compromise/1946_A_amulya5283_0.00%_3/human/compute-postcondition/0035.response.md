Output State: **`test_cases` is used to assign its i-th element to `n` and `arr`; `arr` is sorted; `median_index` is n // 2; `current_median` is arr[median_index]; `heap` is arr[median_index:]; `heap` is converted into a min-heap; `operations` is 3; `smallest` is the smallest element in `heap`; `heap[0]` is now `smallest + 1`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `operations` by 1. Initially, `operations` was 2, so after executing `operations += 1`, `operations` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
