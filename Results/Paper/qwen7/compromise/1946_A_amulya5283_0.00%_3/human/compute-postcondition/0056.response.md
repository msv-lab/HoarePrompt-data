Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 1`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr`; `operations` is 1**

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `smallest`. Since the heap started from `arr[n // 2]`, the smallest element popped is `arr[n // 2]`, which means the current median (`arr[n // 2]`) is now one less than its previous value. The heap is now adjusted to start from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr`, and the number of operations performed is incremented by 1.
