Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 1`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element incremented by 1; `operations` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the smallest element in the heap (which is `arr[n // 2 + 1]`) incremented by 1 into the heap. Since `smallest` is `arr[n // 2 + 1]`, the new smallest element in the heap is now `arr[n // 2 + 1] + 1`. The `operations` counter is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
