Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the first tuple from the `test_cases` list to `n` and `arr`. Since `test_cases` is a list of tuples and `i` is 0, `n` is set to the first element of the first tuple, and `arr` is set to the second element of the same tuple. All other variables remain unchanged.
