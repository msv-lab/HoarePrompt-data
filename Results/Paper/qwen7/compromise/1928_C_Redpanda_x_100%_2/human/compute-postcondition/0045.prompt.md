Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`.
Code of the loop:
for factor in rest:
    prime_to_i = 1
    for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
        yield factor * prime_to_i
        prime_to_i *= prime


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `factor` is `prime`, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime * prime_to_i`, `rest` remains as it was initially, and `factors[prime]` is 2.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `factor` will be set to `prime`, `prime_to_i` will be updated to `prime * prime * prime_to_i`, `rest` will remain unchanged from its initial state, and `factors[prime]` will be exactly 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `factor` is the next element in `rest` after `prime`, `prime_to_i` is `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `rest` remains as it was initially, and the loop has executed `factors[prime] + 1` times.

In this final state, `factor` remains the same as it was initialized before the loop started. The variable `prime_to_i` is updated to the value of `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime] + 1` after the loop completes all its iterations. The `rest` list remains unchanged throughout the process. The loop itself has completed exactly `factors[prime] + 1` iterations as specified by the condition in the loop head.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
