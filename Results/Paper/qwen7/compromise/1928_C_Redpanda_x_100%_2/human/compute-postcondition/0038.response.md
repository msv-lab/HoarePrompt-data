Output State: **`factor` is the next element in `rest` after `prime`, `prime_to_i` is `factor * (prime * prime_to_i)`, `rest` remains as it was initially**.

Explanation: The code multiplies `prime_to_i` by `prime`. Initially, `prime_to_i` is equal to `factor * prime_to_i`. After executing `prime_to_i *= prime`, `prime_to_i` becomes `factor * prime_to_i * prime`, which simplifies to `factor * (prime * prime_to_i)`. The values of `factor` and `rest` remain unchanged.
