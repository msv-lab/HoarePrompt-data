Output State: **`factor` is the next element in `rest` after `prime`, `prime_to_i` is updated to `factor * (prime * prime_to_i)`, `rest` remains as it was initially, and the loop counter is `k+1`.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` does not assign a new value to any variable but instead yields a value. The value of `factor * prime_to_i` is produced as the output of the generator, but the variables `factor`, `prime_to_i`, `rest`, and the loop counter `k` remain unchanged from their previous states.
