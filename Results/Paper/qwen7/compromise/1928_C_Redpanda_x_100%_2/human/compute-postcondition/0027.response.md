Output State: **`factor` is defined and equals `prime`, `prime_to_i` is now `prime * prime_to_i`, `rest` remains unchanged, and `factors[prime]` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` sets `factor` to `prime` (since `factors[prime]` was 1 before and is incremented to 2), updates `prime_to_i` to `prime * prime_to_i`, and does not affect `rest`. The `yield` statement does not change the state of variables outside the scope of the generator, so `rest` remains a non-empty list excluding its first element, and `factors[prime]` is updated to 2.
