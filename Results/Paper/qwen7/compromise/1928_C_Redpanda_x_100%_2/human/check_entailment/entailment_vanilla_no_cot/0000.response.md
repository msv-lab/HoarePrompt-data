Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution attempts to generate factors of a number using prime factorization but does not correctly solve the problem at hand. The problem requires determining how many values of \( k \) fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position and the number he received. The functions `func_1` and `generate` do not address the logic needed to solve this problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to understand the repeating pattern of the settling process. Given a position \( n \) and a number \( x \), we need to find all possible \( k \) such that the number \( x \) appears at position \( n \) in the repeating sequence of length \( 2k-2 \).

Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

```python
def count_valid_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    # Iterate over possible values of k
    for k in range(2, n // 2 + 1):
        cycle_length = 2 * k - 2
        if (n - 1) % cycle_length == (x - 1) % cycle_length:
            count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_k(n, x))
```

This solution iterates over possible values of \( k \) and checks if the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit the pattern described. It counts the number of valid \( k \) values that satisfy the condition.
