Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM", where "h1" is the hour converted to 12-hour format, "m" is the minute, and "AM/PM" indicates whether it is morning or afternoon. The specific times printed depend on the inputs provided during the loop executions. Each line represents the transformed time from the input "hh:mm" into 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.
