Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. However, there are several issues with the logic used in the conversion process:

1. **Redundant and Inefficient Code**: The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the hour from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. This approach is inefficient and can be simplified using modulo arithmetic.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Midnight and Noon**: The program correctly handles the conversion for most hours but fails to handle the special cases for midnight (`00:00`) and noon (`12:00`). Specifically, when `h` is `'00'`, it should be converted to `'12'` and marked as AM, and when `h` is `'12'`, it should also be marked as PM.

3. **Lack of Modulo Arithmetic**: Using modulo arithmetic would simplify the conversion logic significantly. For example, `h % 12` can be used to get the equivalent hour in the 12-hour format, and checking if `h` is greater than or equal to `'12'` can determine whether it's PM.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly handle all edge cases and is inefficient. Therefore, the program is not correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
