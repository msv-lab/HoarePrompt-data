Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in the original string `a` to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, a.split()))` splits the string `a` into a list of substrings based on spaces and then converts each substring to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list replaces the original string `a`. The variables `t` and `k` remain unchanged.
