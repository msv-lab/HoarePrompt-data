Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in the original string `a` to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `c`, `c` is a list of integers where elements are appended based on the conditions inside the loop, `d` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of the list `c`, and `c` is not equal to `d`.
