Reasoning:
- The annotated program does not match the problem statement in several key aspects:
  1. The function `func_1()` is called without any input parameters, but the problem requires processing multiple test cases.
  2. The variable `b` is initialized as an empty list outside the function, but the function does not use this list directly. Instead, it appends values to a local list `c`.
  3. The logic inside `func_1()` does not correctly implement the digit splitting and reinsertion process described in the problem statement.
  4. The final check to see if the list `c` is sorted is performed, but the list `b` is not used to store the results for each test case.
  5. The main loop that processes each test case is missing.

Given these discrepancies, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
