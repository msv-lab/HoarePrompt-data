Postcondition: `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is incremented by `a`, `y1` is adjusted based on the relationship with `y2`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` reduced by `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, `x2` is not greater than `n`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `a` is either `y2 - 1` if `y1` â‰¥ `y2` or `m - y2` if `y1` < `y2`, `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.
