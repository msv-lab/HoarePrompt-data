Output State: **`r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` increased by `a`, `y1` is now 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` decreased by `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r` decreased by `a`, and `y1` is less than `y2`; `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2 > x1`, `x1 ≥ 1`, `x2 ≤ n`, `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`, `c` is `y2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `y2 - 1` to the variable `c`. Since `y2` is the sixth element of `r` decreased by `a`, `c` is now `y2 - 1`. All other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged.
