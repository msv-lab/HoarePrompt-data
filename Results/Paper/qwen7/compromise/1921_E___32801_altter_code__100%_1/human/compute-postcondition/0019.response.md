Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter.
- `n` is the first element of `r`.
- `m` is the second element of `r`.
- `x1` is incremented by 1.
- `y1` is equal to `y2`.
- `x2` is the fifth element of `r`.
- `y2` is the sixth element of `r`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.

The `print` statement is `print('Alice')`. This statement directly prints the string `'Alice'` without referencing any of the other variables mentioned.

Output: **Alice**
