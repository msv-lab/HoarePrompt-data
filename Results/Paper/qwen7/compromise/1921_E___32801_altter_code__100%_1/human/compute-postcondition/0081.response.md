Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` increased by `a`, `y1` is the second element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` decreased by `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r` plus `a`, and `y1` is now equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The code `y2 += a` increases the value of `y2` by `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still `abs(y2 - y1)` since `y2` has only been updated by adding `a`.
