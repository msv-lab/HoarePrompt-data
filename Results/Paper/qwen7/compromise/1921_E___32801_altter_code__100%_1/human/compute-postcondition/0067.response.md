Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from splitting the input string using space as delimiter, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` increased by `a`, `y1` is the fourth element of `r`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r` decreased by `a`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`; `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`**.

Explanation: The code `x2 -= a` decreases the value of `x2` by `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `x2` is now `x2 - a`. The conditions and relationships between the other variables and their values remain the same as in the initial state.
