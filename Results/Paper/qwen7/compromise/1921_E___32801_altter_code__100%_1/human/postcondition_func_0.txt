The function reads six integers from the standard input, representing the dimensions of a grid and two coordinates. It then determines which player, Alice or Bob, wins based on the relative positions of the coordinates and prints the result. If the initial conditions do not lead to a clear winner, it prints 'draw'. The function does not return any value.
