Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing**: The program correctly defines functions to parse input and process each test case. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` handle reading input values and parsing them appropriately.
2. **Graph Construction and Edge Processing**: The function `func_6` constructs the graph using an adjacency list and sorts the edges in descending order by weight. It then uses Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum-weight edge that connects two nodes within the same connected component. This ensures that we find a simple cycle with the minimum weight edge.
3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: The function `dfs` performs a DFS to find a cycle involving the identified edge. If a cycle is found, it returns the nodes forming the cycle.
4. **Main Function Execution**: The function `func_7` iterates over the number of test cases and calls `func_6` for each test case, ensuring that all test cases are processed correctly.

Given the provided information and the logical flow of the program, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality. It reads the input, processes each test case, finds a simple cycle with the minimum weight edge, and outputs the required results.

Correctness: **True**
