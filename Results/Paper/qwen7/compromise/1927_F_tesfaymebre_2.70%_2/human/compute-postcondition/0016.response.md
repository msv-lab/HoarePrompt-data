Based on the initial state provided:

- `_min_edge` remains positive infinity (`float('inf')`)
- `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`
- `colors` is a list of length `n+1` where all elements are `0`
- `res` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(node_u, -1, [])`

Let's break down the `print(*res)` statement:

1. The `dfs` function is called with arguments `node_u = -1`, `parent = -1`, and `path = []`.
2. Since `node_u` is `-1`, it means this is likely the starting point of the DFS traversal.
3. The `colors` list is initialized such that all elements are `0`, indicating no nodes have been visited yet.
4. The `dfs` function will traverse the graph, marking nodes as visited and updating the path.
5. The result `res` will contain the path from the starting node to the destination node (if any), or possibly some other relevant information depending on the implementation of the `dfs` function.

Given the information, the `res` variable will contain a list representing the path found by the DFS traversal, but since the exact path is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the general behavior of the DFS function.

Output: **[-1, -1, ...] (where the list contains the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal, starting from -1 and ending at the destination node if found)**
