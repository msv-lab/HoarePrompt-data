Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and the expression `range(test_cases)`. The variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable when the index itself is not needed within the loop body. The key object here is `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `test_cases` is a positive integer. If `test_cases` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on `test_cases`, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state where `test_cases` is a positive integer returned by `func_1()`, we need to confirm that `test_cases` remains a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`test_cases` must be a positive integer**.
