Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s:`. Here, the objects involved are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` will take on the values from the list `s` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one element. If `s` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` will take on the values from `s`, we don't need to adjust its initial state directly.
   - We need to ensure that `s` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `s` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `r` is an empty string**
