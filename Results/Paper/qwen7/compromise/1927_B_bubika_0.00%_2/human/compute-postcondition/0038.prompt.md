Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is an empty string, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `i` is the first element of the original `s`, `b[x]` is `i` + (number of times the loop has executed - 1), `n` is an input integer, `s` is updated to a list of integers from user input, `b` is a list where each element is incremented based on its occurrence in `s`, `t` is `t + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    x = b.index(i)
    r += a[x]
    b[x] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `r` is increased by `a[x]`, `s` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of the original `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in list `b`, and `b[x]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is increased by `a[x]` and then further increased by `a[x]` (i.e., `r` is increased by `2 * a[x]`), `s` must have at least one element, `i` is the second element of the original `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in list `b`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, and `x` is assigned the index of `i` in list `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is increased by `a[x]`, `s` must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in the list `s` after the current `i`, `x` is the index of the new `i` in list `b`, `b[x]` is increased by 1 and then assigned the index of `i` in list `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
