Output State: **`n` is an input integer**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which in this case means they are not defined. The only affected variable is `n`, which now holds the integer value of the user's input.
