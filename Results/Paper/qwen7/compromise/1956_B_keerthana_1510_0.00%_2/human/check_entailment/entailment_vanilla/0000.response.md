### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get in the card game, assuming both players play optimally. The key points are:
   - Nene will always try to maximize her score while minimizing yours.
   - You need to strategically choose which card to play to maximize your points.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads input from standard input.
   - It processes every other line starting from the third line (skipping the first two lines).
   - For each line, it counts the occurrences of each unique element and divides by 3 using `elements.count(item) // 3`.
   - It sums these values and prints the result.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic in the given program does not align with the problem requirements.
   - The division by 3 (`// 3`) and counting the occurrences of each unique element do not reflect the strategy needed to maximize your points.
   - The program does not simulate the game or account for Nene's optimal play strategy.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, you would need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players.
   - You should count how many pairs of the same number exist in your hand and how they can be played to maximize your points while considering Nene's optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
