Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers `a` containing `n` elements, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and each element `a_i` in the list is an integer between 1 and `n` (inclusive) with each integer appearing at most twice. The function returns information about the list `a` based on the given constraints.**
