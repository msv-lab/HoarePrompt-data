### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step using the provided problem description and function summary.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `b` is odd, `t` is incremented by 1 to ensure enough space for all 2x2 icons (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and we need to round up to the nearest integer when dividing by 4).
   - This calculation ensures that there are enough 2x2 icons placed without overlap.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space After Placing 2x2 Icons**:
   - `t1` calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. It uses the formula `t * 15 - b * 4`, where `15` is the total number of cells in a 5x3 grid.
   - This formula accounts for the space left after placing `t` full grids of 2x2 icons.

4. **Placing 1x1 Icons**:
   - `t2` calculates how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space (`t1`).
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons using the formula `a - t1` and then divides by 15 (cells per grid) and rounds up.

5. **Output**:
   - The final number of screens required is printed for each test case.

### Testing with Provided Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples to verify its correctness.

#### Test Case 1: `1 1`
- `t = 1` (since `b = 1` and `1 % 2 != 0` so `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`)
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
- `t2 = 1 - 11 = -10` (not possible, so `t = 1`)

#### Test Case 2: `7 2`
- `t = 2` (since `b = 2` and `2 % 2 == 0` so `t = 2 // 2 = 1`)
- `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
- `t2 = 7 - 7 = 0` (no additional screens needed)
- `t = 1`

#### Test Case 3: `12 4`
- `t = 2` (since `b = 4` and `4 % 2 == 0` so `t = 4 // 2 = 2`)
- `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`
- `t2 = 12 - 22 = -10` (not possible, so `t = 2`)

#### Test Case 4: `0 3`
- `t = 2` (since `b = 3` and `3 % 2 != 0` so `t = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`)
- `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`
- `t2 = 0 - 18 = -18` (not possible, so `t = 2`)

#### Test Case 5: `1 0`
- `t = 1` (since `b = 0` and `0 % 2 == 0` so `t = 0 // 2 = 0`)
- `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
- `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1` (one additional screen needed)
- `t = 1`

### Detailed Analysis

Upon closer inspection, the logic in the program does not correctly account for the placement of 1x1 icons. Specifically, the calculation of `t1` and `t2` does not accurately reflect the available space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

For example, in Test Case 3 (`12 4`), the program calculates `t1 = 22`, which means there are 22 cells available after placing 4 2x2 icons. However, since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, the actual available space for 1x1 icons should be calculated differently.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit in the grid and then determine the remaining space for 1x1 icons. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit
        t = b
        if b % 2 != 0:
            t += 1
        # Calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons
        remaining_space = (5 * 3 - b * 4) * t
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens = (a - remaining_space) // 15
        if (a - remaining_space) % 15 != 0:
            additional_screens += 1
        # Total number of screens
        total_screens = t + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)
```

### Final Evaluation

The original program has logical errors in calculating the available space for 1x1 icons. The corrected approach ensures that the space is calculated accurately. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

**Final: False**
