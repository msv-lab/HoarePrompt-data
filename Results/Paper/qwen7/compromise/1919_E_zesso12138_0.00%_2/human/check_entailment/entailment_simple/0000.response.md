### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the number of ways to construct the original array `a` from the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to accumulate the number of ways to reach each prefix sum value.
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a single `1` at the middle index (`offset`), indicating the starting point.
   - The function iterates through the prefix sums, updating the `dp` array to reflect the cumulative number of ways to achieve each prefix sum value.
   - Finally, it returns the value corresponding to the last element of the sorted prefix sum array `p`, adjusted by the offset.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the parsing of input and the computation for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed out.

3. **Overall Program Correctness:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is appropriate for counting the number of valid arrays `a`.
   - The input handling and output formatting in `func_2` are correct.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

### Correctness:
**True**
