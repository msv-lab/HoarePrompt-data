Output State: **`new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, all elements are 0 except for `new_dp[j + 1]` which is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, `i` is 2 * n + 1, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where each element `new_dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 * n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`, and there exists at least one `j` such that `dp[j] > 0`. The current value of `j` satisfies \(j + 1 \leq 2 * n\).**

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to it and taking modulo `MOD`. Since the initial state of `new_dp` is a list of zeros, only the element `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated. All other elements remain 0. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `dp`) retain their initial values.
