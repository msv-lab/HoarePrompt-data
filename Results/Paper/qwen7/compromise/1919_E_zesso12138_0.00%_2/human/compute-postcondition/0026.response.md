Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 2 * (n + 3)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index` and of length `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list to which the `result` has been appended.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The other variables (`data`, `index`, `t`, `p`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, where `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index` and of length `n`.
