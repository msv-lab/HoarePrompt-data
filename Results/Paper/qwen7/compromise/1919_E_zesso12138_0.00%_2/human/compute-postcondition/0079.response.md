Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` inclusive, so the loop condition is `i < n + 1`.
3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where each element `new_dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 * n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`.
   - `j` is \(2 * n + 1\).
   - `n` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is \(2 * n\).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes \(2 * n + 1\).
   - Since `i` is now \(2 * n + 1\), it is no longer less than `n + 1`, so the loop will not execute again unless `n` is increased.

Given these points, the only adjustments needed are for the variables `i` and `n`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` is updated to \(2 * n + 1\).
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where each element `new_dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 * n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`, `i` is \(2 * n + 1\), and `n` is at least 1.**
