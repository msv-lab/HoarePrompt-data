Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 2`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value obtained from `data[index]`, `results` now contains an extra element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.

Explanation: The code `results.append(result)` appends the return value of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated state includes the new element in the `results` list.
