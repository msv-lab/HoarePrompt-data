Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer within the range of 1 to 5000, and `p`, a sorted list of `n` integers where the absolute value of each element does not exceed `n`. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` of length \(2 \times n + 1\) with all elements set to 0, except for the middle element which is set to 1. The function then iterates through the array, updating each element based on the values of its neighboring elements, ensuring that only positive values contribute to the update. After completing these iterations, the function calculates `final_sum` as the last element of `p` plus an offset `n`. Finally, it returns the value of `dp[final_sum]`, which represents the cumulative sum of all previously updated positive values in the `dp` array, taken modulo `MOD`.**
