Output State: **`new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, all elements are 0 except for `new_dp[j + 1]` which is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, `i` is 2 * n + 1, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where each element `new_dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 * n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`, and there exists at least one `j` such that `dp[j] > 0`. The current value of `j` satisfies \(j + 1 \leq 2 * n\) and the current value of `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. This means that the previous value of `new_dp[j - 1]` is incremented by `dp[j]` and then taken modulo `MOD`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
