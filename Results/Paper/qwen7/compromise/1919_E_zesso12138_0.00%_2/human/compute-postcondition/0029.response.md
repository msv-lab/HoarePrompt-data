To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `results`.
   - The only variable in the loop head is `res`.

2. **Determine the State of `res`:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `results`, `res` will take on each value in `results` during each iteration.
   - Therefore, `res` must be an element of `results` for the loop to execute.

3. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables mentioned in the problem (e.g., `data`, `index`, `t`, `p`, `n`, `func_1`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of `res`, which must be an element of `results`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`res` is an element of `results`**
