Output State: **`new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, `i` is 2 * n + 2, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, where each element `new_dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 * n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`, and there exists at least one `j` such that `dp[j] > 0`. The current value of `j` is 2 * n + 2.**

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j + 1]` to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Given the initial state, `j` was 2 * n + 1, and now it has been incremented to 2 * n + 2. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
