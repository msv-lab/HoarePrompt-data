Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers.**

Explanation: The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. Since `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, the new value of `index` becomes `index + n`. The other variables (`data`, `p`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
