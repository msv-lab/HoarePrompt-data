Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 2`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value obtained from `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `result` to the return value of `func_1(n, p)`. It also increments `index` by `n + 2` and decreases `t` by 1. The values of `data`, `p`, `results`, and `n` remain as per their initial conditions, with `n` being the integer value obtained from `data[index]`.
