Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `j` is 2 * `n` + 1, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of 2 * `n` + 1 zeros. For every index `i` from 0 to 2 * `n` inclusive, `new_dp[i]` will be the sum of `dp` values from `i` to `2 * n` (inclusive), modulo `MOD`.

This means that each element in `new_dp` will contain the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements in `dp` from its index to the end of the list, wrapping around the list boundaries using modulo operation.
