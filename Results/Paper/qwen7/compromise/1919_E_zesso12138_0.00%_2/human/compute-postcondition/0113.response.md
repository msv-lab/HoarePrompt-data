Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `new_dp` will be a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element `new_dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, every element in `new_dp` will have been updated based on the values of `dp` according to the rules specified in the loop. Since the loop processes each index `j` from `0` to `2 * n`, and updates the neighboring indices `j-1` and `j+1` (if they exist) with the value of `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`, by the end of the loop, `new_dp[j]` will contain the cumulative sum of all positive `dp[j]` values up to that point, wrapped around using the modulo operation. This means that `new_dp` will reflect the final state where each position holds the sum of contributions from all previous positions where `dp[j]` was greater than zero.
