Output State: **`new_dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\), and `j` is \(k + 1\); if \(j - 1 \geq 0\), then `new_dp[j - 1]` is unchanged, `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\), and `i` is \(2 \times n + 2\); if \(j - 1 < 0\), then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\), and `i` is \(2 \times n + 2\)**.

This means that the code updates the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` to \((new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) \% MOD\). The condition \(j - 1 \geq 0\) determines whether `new_dp[j - 1]` is also involved in the update. If \(j - 1 \geq 0\), then `new_dp[j - 1]` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is set to \(2 \times n + 2\), which does not change regardless of the condition on `j`.
