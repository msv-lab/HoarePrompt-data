Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = 2 * n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2 * `n`.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `dp` is equal to `new_dp`.
   - `new_dp` is a list of 2 * `n` + 1 zeros.
   - If `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, then the element at index `j` in `new_dp` is updated to (`new_dp[j] + dp[j - 1]) % MOD`. Otherwise, `new_dp` remains unchanged.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - The loop updates the value of `new_dp[j]` if `j - 1` is non-negative.
   - After updating, `j` is incremented by 1.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was 2 * `n` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `2 * n + 1`.
   - The condition `j - 1` will now be `2 * n`, which is non-negative.
   - Hence, the element at index `j` (which is `2 * n + 1`) in `new_dp` will be updated to (`new_dp[2 * n + 1] + dp[2 * n] % MOD`).

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be `2 * n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same (at least 1).
   - `dp` is still equal to `new_dp`.
   - `new_dp` remains a list of 2 * `n` + 1 zeros, but now the element at index `2 * n + 1` will be updated.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `j` is 2 * `n` + 1, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of 2 * `n` + 1 zeros.**
