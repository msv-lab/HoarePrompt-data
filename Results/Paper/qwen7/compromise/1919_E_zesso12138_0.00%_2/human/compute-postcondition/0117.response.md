Output State: **`final_sum` is equal to `p[-1] + offset`, `dp` is a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element `dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the variable `final_sum` by adding the last element of the list `p` (i.e., `p[-1]`) to `offset`. The list `dp` remains unchanged from its final state after the loop, which is defined as a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element `dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`.
