Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 2`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer value obtained from `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The line `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. Since `n` is an integer value obtained from `data[index]`, the new value of `index` becomes `index + n`. Additionally, `index` was already incremented by 2 before this line, so the final value of `index` is `index + n + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
