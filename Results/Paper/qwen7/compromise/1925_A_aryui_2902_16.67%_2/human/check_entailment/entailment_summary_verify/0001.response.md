### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate a string \( s \) such that every possible string of length \( n \) that can be formed using the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in \( s \). The goal is to minimize the length of \( s \).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads an integer \( t \) representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1()` takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \) as input.
   - It constructs a string \( s \) consisting of the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets repeated \( n \) times (`s[:k] * n`).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1()` generates a string by repeating the first \( k \) characters of a predefined string `s` (which is `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw"`). This approach does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) characters are included in the generated string.
   - For example, for \( n=3 \) and \( k=2 \), the expected output would be a string like `"aabbaa"`, but the program generates `"ababab"`. This does not cover all possible subsequences of length 3 using the first 2 characters ('a' and 'b').

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where \( n > k \) correctly. For instance, if \( n=3 \) and \( k=2 \), the expected output would be `"aabbaa"`, but the program will generate `"ababab"`.
   - The program does not ensure that the generated string \( s \) contains all subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) characters. Instead, it simply repeats the first \( k \) characters \( n \) times, which does not guarantee the required subsequences.

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary states that the function constructs and returns a new string consisting of the first \( k \) characters of a predefined string `s`, repeated \( n \) times. However, this summary does not reflect the requirement to include all possible subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) characters.

### Conclusion:
- The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) characters appear in the generated string \( s \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length \( n \) using the first \( k \) characters are included in the generated string \( s \).
