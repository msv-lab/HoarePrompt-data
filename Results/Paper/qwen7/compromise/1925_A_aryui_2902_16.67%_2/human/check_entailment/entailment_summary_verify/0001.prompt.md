You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program:
import collections
from collections import Counter
from collections import defaultdict
import math
from math import log

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    res = func_1()
    print(res)

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
    return s[:k] * n



- Function Summary: 
The function processes the values of `n` and `k` obtained from input, along with a predefined string `s`. It constructs and returns a new string consisting of the first `k` characters of `s`, repeated `n` times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`. The goal is to minimize the length of `s`.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1()` takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
   - It constructs a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times (`s[:k] * n`).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - For the first test case (`n=1`, `k=2`), the output should be `"ab"`. The program generates `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw"` and returns the first 2 characters repeated once, which is `"ab"`.
   - For the second test case (`n=2`, `k=1`), the output should be `"aa"`. The program generates `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw"` and returns the first character repeated twice, which is `"aa"`.
   - For the third test case (`n=2`, `k=2`), the output should be `"baab"`. The program generates `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw"` and returns the first 2 characters repeated twice, which is `"baab"`.
   - For the fourth test case (`n=2`, `k=3`), the output should be `"abcbac"`. The program generates `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw"` and returns the first 3 characters repeated twice, which is `"abcbac"`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `n > k` correctly. For example, if `n=3` and `k=2`, the expected output would be `"aabbaa"`, but the program will generate `"ababab"`.
   - The program does not ensure that the generated string `s` contains all subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters. Instead, it simply repeats the first `k` characters `n` times, which does not guarantee the required subsequences.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters appear in the generated string `s`.
