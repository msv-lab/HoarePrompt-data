Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26; `s` is a string containing 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'**.

The code initializes a string `s` with the value `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`. This string does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`, so their ranges remain unchanged.
