The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and returns two indices, `r` and `l`, that maximize the value of `sm`. Here, `sm` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the list before index `l` and after index `r`, plus the square of the distance between `r` and `l`. The function iterates through all possible pairs of indices to find the pair that yields the highest value of `sm`.
