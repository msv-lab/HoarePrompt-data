Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements of an array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times. The operation involves choosing a subarray and setting all elements in that subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray.

### Provided Functions
1. **func_1(lst):**
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum.
   - It iterates through all possible subarrays, calculates the sum of the subarray plus the contribution from the remaining parts of the array, and keeps track of the best subarray found.
   - However, the logic here is flawed because it doesn't correctly compute the MEX and the new sum after setting the subarray to the MEX value.

2. **func_2(r, l, ops: list):**
   - This function recursively constructs a sequence of operations.
   - It seems to be intended to build a sequence of operations to transform the array, but it doesn't actually compute the MEX or update the array values.

3. **func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):**
   - This function is supposed to perform the actual operation on the subarray and record the operation.
   - It incorrectly sets the subarray to the length of the subarray instead of the MEX value.
   - It also includes redundant operations and does not correctly handle the MEX calculation.

### Correctness Analysis
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is fundamentally flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX value and the resulting sum after setting the subarray to the MEX value.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function is intended to build a sequence of operations but does not correctly implement the logic to achieve the maximum sum.
- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function incorrectly sets the subarray to the length of the subarray rather than the MEX value, and it includes redundant operations.

Given these issues, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly solve the problem according to the problem description.

**Correctness: False**
