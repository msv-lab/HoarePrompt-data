Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not seem to address the core requirement of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the specified operations.

- **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to find a subarray that maximizes the sum plus the square of its length. However, this approach does not align with the actual problem statement, which requires setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX of that subarray. The logic here is fundamentally flawed and does not reflect the intended solution.

- **Functions `func_2` and `func_3`**: These functions are called within `func_1` but do not appear to be correctly implementing the MEX operation or the required sequence of operations to maximize the array sum. They seem to be recursively adding operations without properly addressing the MEX calculation or the goal of maximizing the array sum.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
