Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`, and it starts from `i + 1` and goes up to `len(lst) - 1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body updates `sm` with a new calculated value. If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `over_sum` is set to `sm` and `r` is set to `[i, j]`. Otherwise, `r` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - **`sm`**: This is updated in each iteration of the loop, but its exact value depends on the loop body, which is omitted here. We cannot determine the exact value of `sm` without knowing the loop body, but we know it is updated in each iteration.
   - **`over_sum`**: This is updated if `sm` is greater than `over_sum` during the current iteration.
   - **`r`**: This is updated if `sm` is greater than `over_sum` during the current iteration, otherwise, it remains unchanged.
   - **`j`**: This is the loop variable and it starts from `i + 1` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `len(lst)`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `sm` is updated to the new calculated value.
- If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `over_sum` equals `sm` and `r` equals `[i, j]`. Otherwise, `r` remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

Since the exact values of `sm`, `over_sum`, and `r` depend on the loop body, we cannot provide their exact values. However, we can say that `over_sum` and `r` will either remain unchanged or be updated based on the condition in the loop body.

State: **`sm` is updated to the new calculated value, `over_sum` may be equal to `sm` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum` during the current iteration, `r` may be equal to `[i, j + 1]` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum` during the current iteration, `j` is `j + 1`**
