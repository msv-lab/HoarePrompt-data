Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to `i + 1`, where `i` is given as `1`.
   - Therefore, `j` should start at `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < len(lst)`.
   - Given that `lst` has a length of at least 2, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the length of `lst`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `j` starts at 2 and the loop will continue as long as `j < len(lst)`, we need to ensure that `j` is within the bounds of the list.
   - We don't need to adjust `lst` further because its length is already known to be at least 2.
   - The other variables (`l`, `r`, `over_sum`, `i`, `sm`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should be `2`.
- `lst` should have a length of at least 2.

State: **`j` is 2, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2**
