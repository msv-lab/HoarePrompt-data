Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), `ops` is a list containing [[r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]], `n` is l - r + 1.**

The code calculates the value of `n` as `l - r + 1`. This value is assigned to `n`, updating its value from whatever it was previously (if any) to `l - r + 1`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
