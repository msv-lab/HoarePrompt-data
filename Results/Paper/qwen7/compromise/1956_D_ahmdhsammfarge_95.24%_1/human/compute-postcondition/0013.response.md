Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 0, `r` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of all elements in `lst`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `sm` is equal to `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[3:]) + (2 - 0 + 1) ** 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` as follows:
- `sum(lst[:0])` is the sum of elements from index 0 to 0-1, which is an empty slice and thus evaluates to 0.
- `sum(lst[3:])` is the sum of elements from index 3 to the end of the list. Since `j` is 2, `j + 1` is 3, and this slice starts from the third element.
- `(j - i + 1) ** 2` calculates the square of the number of elements between `i` and `j` inclusive, which is `(2 - 0 + 1) ** 2 = 3 ** 2 = 9`.

Therefore, `sm` is updated to `0 + sum(lst[3:]) + 9`. The other variables remain unchanged.
