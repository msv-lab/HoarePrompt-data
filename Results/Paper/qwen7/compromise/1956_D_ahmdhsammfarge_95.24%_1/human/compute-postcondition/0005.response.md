Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), `ops` is a list containing [[r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]], and `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the list `ops`. This does not affect the values of `lst`, `r`, `l`, or `n`. The sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` remains unchanged as per the initial conditions. Therefore, the only change is in the list `ops`, which now contains `[[r + 1, r + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]]`.
