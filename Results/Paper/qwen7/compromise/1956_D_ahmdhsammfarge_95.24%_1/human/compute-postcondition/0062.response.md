Output State: **`sm` is updated to the new calculated value which is sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2, `over_sum` may be equal to `sm` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum` during the current iteration, `r` may be equal to `[i, j + 1]` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum` during the current iteration, `j` is `j + 1`.**

This means that the value of `sm` has been updated to the new calculated value based on the given formula. The values of `over_sum` and `r` might have been updated if `sm` was greater than `over_sum` during the current iteration. Additionally, `j` has been incremented by 1.
