Postcondition: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), `ops` is a list containing [[r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]], and `n` remains unchanged. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is modified such that each element is replaced by 0. Otherwise, the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` remains unchanged.
