Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(lst), `ops` is a list containing [[r + 1, l + 1], [r + 1, l + 1]], and `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`. Since the list `ops` already contains `[r + 1, l + 1]` from the initial state, after appending it again, `ops` will contain `[r + 1, l + 1]` twice. All other variables remain unchanged, including the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` being 0.
