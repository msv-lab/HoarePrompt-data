Output State: **`sm` is updated to the new calculated value which is sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1); `r` is `i`; `l` is `j`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `i` to `r` and `j` to `l`. The variable `sm` remains unchanged from its previous value, which is the sum of the specified slices of `lst` plus the count of elements between `i` and `j`. The values of `i` and `j` are directly assigned to `r` and `l`, respectively.
