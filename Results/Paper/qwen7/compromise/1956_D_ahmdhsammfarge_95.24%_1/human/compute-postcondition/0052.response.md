Output State: **`r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.**

Explanation: The code `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l` respectively. The value of `sm` remains unchanged and is still greater than `over_sum`. The other variables (`lst`, `i`, `j`, `over_sum`) remain in their initial conditions relative to the postcondition.
