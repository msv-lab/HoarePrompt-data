Output State: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` and `r` are the indices `[i, j]` that produce the maximum value of `sm`, which is the sum of all elements in `lst` before index `i` and after index `j`, plus the square of the distance between `j` and `i`. `over_sum` holds this maximum value of `sm`, and the loop has executed all its iterations.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop, `l` and `r` will be the pair of indices that maximize the expression `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j+1:]) + (j - i + 1)**2`. The variable `over_sum` will store the value of this expression for the optimal pair of indices. The values of `i` and `j` will no longer be used and can be considered as undefined after the loop completes.
