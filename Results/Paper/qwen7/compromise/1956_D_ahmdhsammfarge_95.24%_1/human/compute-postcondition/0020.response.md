Output State: **`lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 2, `r` is 1, `over_sum` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is 3 + sum(lst[1:j]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2**.

Explanation: The code calculates `sm` as the sum of elements before index `i` (which is 0), elements after index `j+1` (which is 4), and the square of the distance between `i` and `j`. Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, the distance is `(3 - 0 + 1) ** 2 = 16`. The sum of elements from index 1 to 3 (i.e., `sum(lst[1:4])`) is added to the initial value of `sm`, which is 3. Therefore, the new value of `sm` is `3 + sum(lst[1:4]) + 16`.
