Output State: **`j` is 4, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `sm` is equal to `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[5:]) + (4 - i + 1), `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variables `r` and `l` respectively. Since `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be the same as `j` (which is 4) because the code does not provide a new value for `i`. Thus, `r` is set to 4 and `l` is set to 4. The values of `j`, `lst`, and `sm` remain unchanged from their initial states.
