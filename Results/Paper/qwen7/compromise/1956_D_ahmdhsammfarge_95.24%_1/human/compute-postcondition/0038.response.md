Postcondition: `j` is 3, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `sm` is equal to sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[4:]) + (3 - i + 1), `r` is `i`, `l` is `j`, and if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, then `sm` remains unchanged and `r` and `l` are as defined. Otherwise, `sm`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.
