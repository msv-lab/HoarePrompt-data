Postcondition: `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with a length of at least 2, `l` is 0, `r` is 3, `over_sum` is 3 + sum(lst[1:3]) + (3 - 0 + 1), `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is 3 + sum(lst[1:3]) + (3 - 0 + 1). If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, the condition holds as specified. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
