The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: two integers `r` and `l` (both within the range 0 to n-1) and a list `ops`. It recursively appends operations to the list `ops` without returning any value. If `r` equals `l`, it appends a specific operation to `ops` and terminates. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself twice with decremented `l` and appends another operation to `ops` after each recursive call.
