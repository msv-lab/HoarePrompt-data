You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b, where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: Output State: The total cost calculated for each test case based on the given conditions. For each test case, if the price of the first bun (b) is greater than or equal to the usual price (a), the total cost is the sum of the first bun's discounted price multiplied by the minimum number of buns sold at the discounted price plus the usual price of the remaining buns. If the first bun's price is less than or equal to the usual price, the total cost is simply the usual price multiplied by the total number of buns.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes three positive integers: n (number of buns), a (usual price of a bun), and b (price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). For each test case, it calculates and returns the total revenue generated from selling all buns.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
