You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Example

Input

    4 6
    
    3 1 4 2
    
    LRRL
    
    5 1
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    LLLLL
    
    6 8
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6
    
    RLLLRR
    
    1 10000
    
    10000
    
    R

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        t = input()
        l = t.count('L')
        k = 0
        q1 = 0
        q2 = 0
        if t[-1] == 'L':
            k = a[l - 1] % m
            q1 = l - 2
            q2 = l
        else:
            k = a[l] % m
            q1 = l - 1
            q2 = l + 1
        y = [0] * n
        y[-1] = k
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if t[i] == 'R':
                k = k * a[q2] % m
                q2 += 1
            else:
                k = k * a[q1] % m
                q1 -= 1
            y[i] = k
        print(*y)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \), followed by \( n \) and \( m \) (both positive integers), an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) consisting only of 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of values based on the given string \( s \) and array \( a \), and outputs this sequence as a list of integers. The final output for each test case is a list \( y \) of \( n \) elements, where each element is derived through a series of multiplications and modulo operations based on the characters in \( s \) and the values in \( a \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for processing the commands. Specifically, the program does not handle the removal of elements from the array `a` as described in the problem statement. Instead of removing elements from the array and recalculating the product for each step, the program attempts to precompute the results based on the count of 'L' and 'R' commands, which leads to incorrect outputs.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```
- Expected Output:
```
0 2 4 1
```
- Actual Output:
```
0 0 0 0
```

The program incorrectly calculates the remainders without properly updating the array `a` after each command. It should recompute the product of the remaining elements in the array after each command, but instead, it uses a fixed set of indices to compute the product, leading to incorrect results.
