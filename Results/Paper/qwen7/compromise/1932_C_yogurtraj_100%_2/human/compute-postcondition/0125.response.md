Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-2` to `-1` in reverse order (decrementing `i` by 1 each time).

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is either 0 or -2.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `y[i]` is equal to `k`.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - If `i` is 0, the loop will stop because `i` will not decrement further.
   - If `i` is -2, the loop will run one more time because it will increment `i` to -1.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` is 0, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, no change is needed for `i` and `n`.
   - If `i` is -2, the loop will execute one more time, so `i` will become -1. Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, `n` must remain the same as it did not change during the last iteration.

Given this analysis, let's consider both scenarios:

- **If `i` is 0**:
  - The loop will not execute again.
  - State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 1, `y[i]` is equal to `k`**

- **If `i` is -2**:
  - The loop will execute one more time, so `i` will become -1.
  - State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be at least 1, `y[i]` is equal to `k`**

Since the problem does not specify which scenario occurred, we need to provide both possible states. However, if we need to choose one based on the most likely scenario, we would typically assume the loop continues unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Therefore, the most general answer considering both scenarios is:

State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be at least 1, `y[i]` is equal to `k`**
