Output State: **`i` is either -1 or -3 depending on whether `t[i]` equals 'R' or not; `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i]` equals 'R', otherwise `k` is updated to `k * a[q1] % m`; `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`; `i` is set to -1 if `t[i]` equals 'R', otherwise `i` is set to -3; `q2` is incremented by 1 if `t[i]` equals 'R', otherwise `q2` remains unchanged; `n` remains at least 1.**

This means that the value of `y[i]` is now equal to the current value of `k`. The value of `i` is updated to either -1 or -3 based on the condition of `t[i]` being 'R' or not. The value of `k` is updated according to the specified conditions involving `a[q1]` and `a[q2]`. The value of `q2` is incremented by 1 only if `t[i]` equals 'R'. All other variables remain in their respective states from the initial conditions.
