Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `t[i]` equals 'R', `k` is `k * a[q2] % m`, `q2` is `q2 + 1`**

Explanation: The code `q2 += 1` increments the value of `q2` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `t[i]`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `q2`.
