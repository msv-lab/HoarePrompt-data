Output State: **`i` is `n - 4` if it was `n - 3` before, or `n - 5` if it was `n - 4` before; `k` is updated to `k * a[q2] % m`; `y`, `t`, `q1`, and `q2` are updated based on the loop body, `q2` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `q2 += 1` increments the value of `q2` by 1. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `k`, `y`, `t`, `q1`, and the original value of `q2` are unchanged except that `q2` has been incremented by 1.
