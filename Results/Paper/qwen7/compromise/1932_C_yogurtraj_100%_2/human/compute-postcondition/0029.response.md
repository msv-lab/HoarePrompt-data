Postcondition: `t` is an input integer, `ii` must be an integer between 1 and `t` inclusive, `n` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the count of 'L' characters in the string representation of `t`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` (if the last character of `t` is 'L') or `a[l] % m` (if the last character of `t` is not 'L'), `q1` is either `l - 2` (if the last character of `t` is 'L') or `l - 1` (if the last character of `t` is not 'L'), `q2` is either `l` (if the last character of `t` is 'L') or `l + 1` (if the last character of `t` is not 'L'), `y` is a list of `n` zeros, `y[-1]` is `k`, and the last character of `t` is not 'R'.
