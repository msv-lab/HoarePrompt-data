Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is `l - 2`, `q2` is `l`**

Explanation: The line `q2 = l` assigns the value of `l` to `q2`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `t`, `a`, `l`, `k`, and `q1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
