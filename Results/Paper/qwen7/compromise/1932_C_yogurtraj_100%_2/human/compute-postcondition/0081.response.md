Output State: **`i` is either `n - 3` or `n - 4`; `k` is `k * a[q2] % m`; `y[i]` is `k * a[q2] % m` if `t[i]` equals 'R', otherwise `y[i]` is `k * a[q1] % m`; `q2` is `q2 + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `q2 += 1` increments the value of `q2` by 1. The values of `i`, `k`, `y[i]`, and `t[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `q2`.
