Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `n-2` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `-1`.
   - `n` must be at least `1`.
   - `k` is updated based on certain conditions.
   - `q2` is incremented by `1` if `t[i] == 'R'`.
   - `q1` is decreased by `1` if `t[i] != 'R'`.
   - `y[i]` is assigned the value of `k`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `-1`, the loop will stop because the condition `i >= -1` is no longer true.
   - Therefore, there is no need to adjust `i` further.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be greater than `-1`.
   - This means `i` should be `-2` at the start of the next iteration.

6. **Update the necessary states**:
   - `i` should be `-2`.
   - `n` must still be at least `1`.
   - `k`, `q2`, and `q1` remain unchanged since they are not directly affected by the loop boundary.
   - `y[i]` is not relevant for the next iteration since `i` will change.

Based on the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is -2, `n` must be at least 1**
