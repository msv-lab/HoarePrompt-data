Output State: `t` is 1001, `i` is 1004 + (n - 3), `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `1001 + n`, because it starts at 1002 and increments by 1 for each iteration. Since `t` remains unchanged at 1001 and the only change in `i` is based on the number of iterations, `i` will be `1001 + n`. The condition for the loop to run is that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, as it needs at least 3 iterations to reach the given state after the third iteration.
