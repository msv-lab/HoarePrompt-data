Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is:
  - `i` is `i_end + 1`.
  - `n` must be `n_value`.

### Loop Statement
The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is `i_end + 1`.
   - `n` must be `n_value`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive.

3. **Current Iteration**: In the current iteration, `i` is `i_end + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value (`i_end + 1`).

5. **Updated State**: After incrementing `i` by 1, `i` becomes `i_end + 2`.

6. **Condition Check**: The condition for the next iteration is that `i` must still be less than `n + 1`. This means `i_end + 2` must be less than `n_value`.

7. **Final State**: The updated state for the next iteration is:
   - `i` is `i_end + 2`.
   - `n` must remain `n_value`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `i_end + 2`, `n` must be `n_value`**.
