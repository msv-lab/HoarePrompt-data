Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49.
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` must be at least 1.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i)
```

Here, `i` is explicitly set to 1. Therefore, when the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
