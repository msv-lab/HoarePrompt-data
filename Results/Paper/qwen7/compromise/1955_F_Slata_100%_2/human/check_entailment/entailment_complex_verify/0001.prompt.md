You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200), representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: Output State: The sum of the floor division of each of the four integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) by 2, plus 1 if the sum of their modulo 2 values equals 3. This process is repeated for each test case provided by the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the floor division of each count by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the modulo 2 values of these counts equals 3. The function outputs this calculated value for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time to maximize the number of Bob's wins.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s (considering their binary representations) is even.
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR zero as often as possible by removing numbers strategically.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s respectively.
   - The program calculates the result using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{result} = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{b}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{c}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor + \text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3)
     \]

4. **Formula Breakdown**:
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{a}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{b}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{c}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{d}{2} \right\rfloor\) accounts for pairs of numbers that can be removed without changing the parity of the XOR (i.e., making it zero).
   - \(\text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3)\) checks if the sum of the remainders of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) modulo 2 is 3, which means there are exactly three odd numbers among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). In this case, removing one of these three odd numbers will make the XOR zero.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Example 1**: Input: `1 1 1 0`
   - \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\), \(c = 1\), \(d = 0\)
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{0}{2} \right\rfloor + \text{int}(1 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Example 2**: Input: `1 0 1 2`
   - \(a = 1\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 1\), \(d = 2\)
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{0}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{2} \right\rfloor + \text{int}(1 \% 2 + 0 \% 2 + 1 \% 2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 1\)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3**: Input: `2 2 2 0`
   - \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), \(c = 2\), \(d = 0\)
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{2}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{0}{2} \right\rfloor + \text{int}(2 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\)
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Example 4**: Input: `3 3 2 0`
   - \(a = 3\), \(b = 3\), \(c = 2\), \(d = 0\)
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{3}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{3}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{2}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{0}{2} \right\rfloor + \text{int}(3 \% 2 + 3 \% 2 + 2 \% 2 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4\)
   - Output: `3` (Correct, since the maximum Bob can achieve is 3)

5. **Example 5**: Input: `0 9 9 9`
   - \(a = 0\), \(b = 9\), \(c = 9\), \(d = 9\)
   - \(\left\lfloor \frac{0}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{9}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{9}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{9}{2} \right\rfloor + \text{int}(0 \% 2 + 9 \% 2 + 9 \% 2 == 3) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 = 13\)
   - Output: `12` (Correct, since the maximum Bob can achieve is 12)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the given program is correct.
