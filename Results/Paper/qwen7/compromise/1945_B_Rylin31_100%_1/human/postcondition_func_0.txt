The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) provided by user input. For each test case, it calculates the value of \(m // a + m // b + 2\) and prints the result. The function reads the number of test cases \(t\) first, then iterates through each test case, performing the calculation and outputting the result. The final state of the program is a series of integers printed to the console, each corresponding to the calculated value for each test case.
