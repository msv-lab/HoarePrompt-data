State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- Before the loop starts, `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- The variable `i` is initialized to 0 within the loop head.
- Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), and `i` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
