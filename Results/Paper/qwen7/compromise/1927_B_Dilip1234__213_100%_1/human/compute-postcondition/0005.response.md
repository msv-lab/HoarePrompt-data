Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 0; `n` must be at least 1; `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]`; `s` is equal to 'a'**.

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j + ord('a')` to the string `s`. Given that `j` must be 0, `ord('a')` is 97, so `chr(j + ord('a'))` evaluates to `chr(97)`, which is 'a'. Therefore, `s` is updated to include the character 'a'. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
