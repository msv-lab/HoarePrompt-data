Output State: **`i` is 26, `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 26, `s` is equal to 'ab', `char_count[j]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends the character corresponding to the index `j` in the alphabet ('b' for `j` being 2) to the string `s`. Initially, `s` is 'a', so after executing the code, `s` becomes 'ab'. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `char_count[j]` remain unchanged.
