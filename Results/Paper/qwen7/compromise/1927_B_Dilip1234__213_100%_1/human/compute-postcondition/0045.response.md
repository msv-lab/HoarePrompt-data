Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `26` (which is the upper bound of the `range` function).

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being set to 0 because `range(26)` generates numbers from 0 to 25.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 26. Therefore, the initial value of `j` must be 0 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the Given States**: We need to adjust the state such that `j` is 0 and the condition `n > 26` is still satisfied. Since `n` is not directly involved in the loop head, its value does not change the ability of the loop to execute based on the given range.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `j` is 0 and `n` must still be greater than 26.

**State: **`i` is 26, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 26**
