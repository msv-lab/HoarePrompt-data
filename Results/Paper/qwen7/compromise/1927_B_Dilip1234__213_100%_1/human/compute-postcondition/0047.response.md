Output State: **`i` is 26, `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 26, and `s` is equal to 'a'.**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends the character corresponding to the index `j + ord('a')` to the string `s`. Here, `ord('a')` returns the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97. Since `j` is initially 0, `j + ord('a')` equals 97, which corresponds to the character 'a'. Thus, `s` becomes 'a'. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `j` is incremented by 1.
