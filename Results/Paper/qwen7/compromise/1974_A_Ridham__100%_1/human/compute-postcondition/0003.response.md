Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is a list containing integers calculated based on the input values of `x` and `y` for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if the condition `space_x <= remaining_cells` is met, `screen_require_for_y` is appended to `result`. Otherwise, `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` is calculated and appended to `result`.
