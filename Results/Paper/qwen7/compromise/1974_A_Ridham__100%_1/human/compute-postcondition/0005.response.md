Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `result` is a list containing integers calculated based on the input values of `x` and `y` for each iteration of the loop.

The `print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))` statement will join the elements of the `result` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Since the exact values of `x`, `y`, and how they are used to calculate the elements of `result` are not specified, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Each element in the `result` list is an integer, and the `map(str, result)` function converts each integer in the list to a string. The `'\n'.join(...)` function then joins these strings with a newline character between them.

Therefore, the output will be a series of lines, each containing one of the integers from the `result` list, separated by newlines.

Output: **a series of integers, each on a new line, where each integer is an element of the `result` list**
