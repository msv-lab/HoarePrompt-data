### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x = x * 1`: This correctly calculates the total space needed for `x` icons of size `1x1`.
   - `space_y = y * 4`: This correctly calculates the total space needed for `y` icons of size `2x2` (each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells).

3. **Total Space Calculation**:
   - `total_space = space_y + space_x`: This correctly calculates the total space required for all icons.

4. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The logic to calculate the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons (`screen_require_for_y`) is correct. It handles both even and odd numbers of `2x2` icons appropriately.

5. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`: This correctly calculates the remaining cells after placing all `2x2` icons.

6. **Checking if Remaining Space Fits 1x1 Icons**:
   - The logic to check if the remaining space can fit all `1x1` icons (`if space_x <= remaining_cells`) is correct.
   - If the remaining space is enough, the program correctly appends the number of screens needed (`screen_require_for_y`).

7. **Handling Extra Space**:
   - If the remaining space is not enough, the program correctly calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining `1x1` icons.
   - The logic to handle the extra space (`extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`) is correct, ensuring that any remainder is accounted for.

8. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case correctly using `'\n'.join(map(str, result))`.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code, the logic appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
