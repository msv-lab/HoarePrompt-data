Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, we need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. However, the given program calculates a value based on a formula that does not relate to the actual game logic.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
1 1 1 0
```

Expected output:
```
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1
```

This suggests that the program might be working correctly for this specific case, but it does not handle the general logic of the game. For instance, the program does not account for the actual sequence of numbers and their bitwise XOR values, which is crucial for determining the outcome of the game.

A correct solution would involve simulating the game process and considering the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers after each removal by Eve. The given program does not do this, making it incorrect for the problem description.
