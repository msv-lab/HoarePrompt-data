Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining whether it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves is flawed. 

For example, consider the test case `(n=5, m=3)`:
- According to the problem, Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move.
- After 5 moves, the number of cubes added minus the number of cubes removed must equal 3.
- This means the difference between the number of additions and removals must be 3.
- However, the current implementation does not check if this condition is met.

The correct approach would be to check if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even, because each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either adding or removing), and thus the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between `n` and `m` must be zero for it to be possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if abs(b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even, which ensures that it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
