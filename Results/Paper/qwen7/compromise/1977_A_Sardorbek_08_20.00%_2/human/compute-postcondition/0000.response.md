Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, a is an input integer.**

The code `a = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds a positive integer value between 1 and 100.
