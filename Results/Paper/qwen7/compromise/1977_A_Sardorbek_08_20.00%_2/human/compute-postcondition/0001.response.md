State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `a`.
2. For the loop to execute, `a` must be a non-negative integer (since `range(a)` requires `a` to be non-negative).
3. At the start of the loop, `i` must be initialized to 0 because the loop starts with `i=0` and increments `i` in each iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` to ensure it is a non-negative integer and `i` to be initialized to 0.
