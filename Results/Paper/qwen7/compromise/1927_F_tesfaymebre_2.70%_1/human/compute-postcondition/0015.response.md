Based on the initial state provided:

- `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among the connected components formed during the DFS process.
- `res` is the result of the DFS starting from `node_u` excluding the parent node.
- `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.
- `dsu` is a DSU object with updated find and union operations based on the edges processed.
- `n` and `m` are both the return values of `func_3()`, which means they have the same value.
- `graph` remains unchanged.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a weight and a pair of connected nodes, sorted in descending order by weight.
- `node_v` is a node index.

When the `print(_min_edge, len(res))` statement is executed, it will print two values:
1. `_min_edge`: The minimum edge weight among the connected components.
2. `len(res)`: The length of the result of the DFS starting from `node_u` excluding the parent node.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **_min_edge, len(res)**
