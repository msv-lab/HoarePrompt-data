Functionality: **The function processes a graph represented by a list of edges and a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure. It first constructs an adjacency list and a sorted list of edges. Then, it finds the minimum edge weight among the connected components using the DSU. Finally, it performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a selected node and prints the minimum edge weight and the nodes visited during the DFS traversal, excluding the parent node.**
