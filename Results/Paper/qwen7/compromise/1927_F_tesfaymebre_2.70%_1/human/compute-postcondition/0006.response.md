Output State: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being traversed with `curr` appended to it, and the color of the current vertex `curr` is now 1. The variable `res` contains a list of vertices forming a cycle if one is found during the DFS traversal, otherwise it is an empty list.
