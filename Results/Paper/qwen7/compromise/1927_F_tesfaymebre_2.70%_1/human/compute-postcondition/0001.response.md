State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation:
- The only variable in the loop head is `test_cases`.
- For the loop `for _ in range(test_cases):` to execute, `test_cases` must be a positive integer greater than 0.
- Since `test_cases` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases after calling `func_1()`, it needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.
- Therefore, the state must be adjusted to reflect that `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
