The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: `curr`, `parent`, and `path`. `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, and `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being traversed during the DFS traversal. The function returns the list `path` if it meets certain conditions, otherwise, it returns an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `dfs` is to accept the current vertex, its parent, and the current path during a DFS traversal, and return the current path if the conditions are met, otherwise return an empty list.
