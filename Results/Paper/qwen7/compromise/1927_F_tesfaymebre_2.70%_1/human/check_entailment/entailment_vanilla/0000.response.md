Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices (`n`) and edges (`m`), and then reads the edges along with their weights.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`).
   - Edges are stored in a list `edges` with each entry being a tuple `(weight, u, v)`.

3. **Sorting Edges:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights using `edges.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to keep track of connected components and the minimum edge weight within each component.
   - The DSU is initialized with `n + 1` elements.

5. **Finding Minimum Weight Cycle:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles.
   - If adding an edge creates a cycle, the program updates the minimum edge weight and stores the nodes involved in the cycle.
   - The minimum edge weight and the nodes forming the cycle are stored in variables `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v`.

6. **DFS Traversal:**
   - A DFS traversal is performed starting from `node_u` to find the cycle.
   - The `colors` array keeps track of the state of each node during the DFS.
   - The function `dfs` returns the path of the cycle when it finds a back edge to a previously visited node.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Verification

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - It correctly identifies cycles and ensures that the cycle is simple (no repeated vertices or edges).

2. **Correctness of DSU:**
   - The DSU implementation is correct for finding the minimum edge in a cycle.
   - The union-find operations are performed efficiently.

3. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The DFS traversal correctly identifies the cycle and ensures that the cycle is simple.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: **True**
