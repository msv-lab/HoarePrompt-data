Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The provided code does not actually implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Instead, `func_1()` is calculating the sum of all segments of consecutive 1's in the list `s` plus the number of such segments. This is not related to the problem of sorting the string via cyclic shifts.
3. The function `func_2()` is reading the number of test cases and then calling `func_1()` for each test case, but this does not address the actual requirements of the problem.

Given that the provided functions do not correctly implement the solution for the given problem, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
