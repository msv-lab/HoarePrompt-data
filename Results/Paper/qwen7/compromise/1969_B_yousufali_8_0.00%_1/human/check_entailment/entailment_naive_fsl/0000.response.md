Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The function `func_1` is designed to handle a list of integers, but the problem requires a binary string. Additionally, the logic inside `func_1` does not account for the minimum cost required to make the string sorted through cyclic shifts of substrings.

To illustrate, consider the input "101011". The expected output is 9, but the current implementation will not produce this result because it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for cyclic shifts. The program attempts to count the number of 1s and adds 1 to the cost for each 0 encountered after a sequence of 1s, which is not a valid approach for solving the problem.

A correct approach would involve identifying the positions of 0s and calculating the minimum cost to move them to their correct positions to sort the string.
