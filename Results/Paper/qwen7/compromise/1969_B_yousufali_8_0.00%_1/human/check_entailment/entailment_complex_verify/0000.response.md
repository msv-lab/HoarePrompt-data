### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. Let's break down why the provided program does not solve the problem as intended:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` expects a list of integers, but the problem specifies that the input is a binary string. This means that the input handling in `func_1` is incorrect. The `input().split()` method will split the input into separate elements, but these elements will be strings, not integers. Therefore, `map(int, input().split())` will convert these strings to integers, but this conversion is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem's requirements.

2. **Logic for Cyclic Shifts**:
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not account for the minimum cost required to make the string sorted through cyclic shifts of substrings. Instead, it simply counts the number of 1s and adds 1 to the cost for each 0 encountered after a sequence of 1s. This approach is fundamentally flawed because it does not reflect the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts to sort the string.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input "101011":
     - The expected output is 9, as described in the problem statement.
     - However, the current implementation will not produce this result because it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for cyclic shifts. For instance, the correct approach would involve identifying the positions of 0s and calculating the minimum cost to move them to their correct positions to sort the string.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
