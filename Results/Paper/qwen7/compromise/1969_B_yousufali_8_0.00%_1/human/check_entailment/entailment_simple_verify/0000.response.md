### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program does not solve the problem correctly.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function reads a list of integers from input, which is incorrect since the problem specifies a binary string.
  - It counts the number of 1s and adds 1 to the cost for each 0 encountered after a sequence of 1s. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the minimum cost required to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - However, the input handling in `func_1` is still incorrect as it processes a list of integers instead of a binary string.

#### Example:
Consider the input "101011":
- The expected output is 9, but the current implementation will not produce this result because it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for cyclic shifts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:
1. Identify the positions of 0s in the string.
2. For each 0, determine the minimum cost to move it to its correct position to sort the string.
3. Sum up the costs for all 0s.

The provided program does not address these steps correctly. Instead, it simply counts the number of 1s and adds 1 to the cost for each 0, which is not a valid approach.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

**Final: False**
