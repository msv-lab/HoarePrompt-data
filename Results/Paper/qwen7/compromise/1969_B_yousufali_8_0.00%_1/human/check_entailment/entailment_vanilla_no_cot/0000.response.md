Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The function `func_1` expects the input to be a list of integers, but the problem specifies that the input should be a binary string. The current implementation splits the input into integers, which is incorrect.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It attempts to count the number of 1s before encountering a 0 and adds `n + 1` to the answer. This approach does not account for the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string. For example, consider the string "101011". The correct solution would involve multiple cyclic shifts, not just counting consecutive 1s and 0s.

3. **Cyclic Shifts Not Implemented**: The problem requires performing cyclic shifts to sort the string, but the current implementation does not include any logic to perform these shifts.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to implement an algorithm that can identify the minimum cost of cyclic shifts required to sort the binary string. Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of how you might approach this:

1. Identify segments of the string where the sequence needs to be shifted.
2. Calculate the cost of shifting each segment.
3. Sum up the costs to get the total minimum cost.

Here is a conceptual implementation of the correct solution:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort_binary_string(s):
    n = len(s)
    i = 0
    ans = 0
    while i < n:
        # Find the end of the current segment of 1s
        j = i
        while j < n and s[j] == '1':
            j += 1
        # If we have reached the end of the string, break
        if j == n:
            break
        # Find the start of the next segment of 0s
        k = j
        while k < n and s[k] == '0':
            k += 1
        # Calculate the cost of shifting the segment of 1s to the beginning
        ans += j - i + 1
        i = k
    return ans

def func_1():
    s = input().strip()
    print(min_cost_to_sort_binary_string(s))

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This code correctly handles the input as a binary string and calculates the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts.
