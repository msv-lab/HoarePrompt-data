Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Variable Naming and Initialization**: The variables `YES` and `NO` are defined but not used. Instead, the program should use `'Bodya'`, `'Sasha'`, and `'Draw'` directly.

2. **Game Logic**: The logic for calculating scores (`resb` and `ress`) is incorrect. The program calculates the score assuming the player will always stay at their current position until the end, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy. The players can choose to move to `p_x` at any point to maximize their score.

3. **Infinite Loops**: The program uses `while True` loops to simulate the game, but it does not handle the case where the player might revisit a position, leading to potential infinite loops.

4. **Score Calculation**: The score calculation assumes the player will stay at their current position until the end, which is not always the best strategy. The program needs to consider the possibility of moving to `p_x` at any point to maximize the score.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        def calculate_score(start_pos):
            path = []
            vis = [0] * n
            vis[start_pos - 1] = 1
            pos = start_pos
            while True:
                path.append(a[pos - 1])
                pos = p[pos - 1]
                if vis[pos - 1] == 1:
                    break
                vis[pos - 1] = 1
            return max(sum(path[i] * (k - i) for i in range(min(len(path), k))))

        resb = calculate_score(pb)
        ress = calculate_score(ps)

        if resb > ress:
            print('Bodya')
        elif ress > resb:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the game logic and ensures that the players can make optimal moves to maximize their scores.
