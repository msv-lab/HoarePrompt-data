Postcondition: **`resb` will hold the highest value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` will be 0, `preb` will be the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` will be 0, `i` will be equal to `len(pathb)`, and `curr` will be the final computed value before the loop exits. Additionally, `resb` will be greater than or equal to `ress`.**
