Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original `n` string to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original `k` string to an integer, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original `pb` string to an integer, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original `ps` string to an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting another input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `vis = [0] * n` creates a list of length `n` filled with zeros and assigns it to the variable `vis`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
