Output State: **`paths` is a list containing `a[ps - 1]` and the appended value `a[ps - 1]`, `vis[ps - 1]` is updated to 1, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of the variables outside of that loop or statement. Therefore, the values of `paths`, `vis[ps - 1]`, and `ps` remain unchanged from their previous states.
