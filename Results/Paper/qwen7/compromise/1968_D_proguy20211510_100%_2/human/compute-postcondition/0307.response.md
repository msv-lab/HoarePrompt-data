Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is `paths[1] * k`, `i` is 2, and `curr` is `paths[0] * k`.**

Explanation: The line `pres += paths[i]` increments `pres` by the value of `paths[i]`, where `i` is initially 1. Since `paths[0] * k` was the value of `curr` and `i` was incremented to 2, `pres` now becomes `paths[1] * k`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
