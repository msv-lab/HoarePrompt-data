Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1) + pathb[3]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 5, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `preb += pathb[i]` increments `preb` by the value of `pathb[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, `preb` is updated to `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1) + pathb[4]`. The other variables (`resb`, `ress`, `pres`, `i`, and `curr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
