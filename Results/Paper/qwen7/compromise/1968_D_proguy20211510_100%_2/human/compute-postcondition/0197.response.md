Output State: **`i` is 2, `pres` is `pres` + `paths[0]` * (`k` - 0)**

Explanation: The code `pres += paths[i]` increments the value of `pres` by `paths[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `i` is now updated to 2. The value of `pres` is updated to its current value plus `paths[0]` multiplied by (`k` - 0). All other variables remain unchanged.
