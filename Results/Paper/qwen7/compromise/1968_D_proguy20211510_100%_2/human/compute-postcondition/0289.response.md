Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of 0 and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[i]`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 3, `curr` is `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`**

Explanation: The line `preb += pathb[i]` updates the value of `preb` by adding `pathb[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is initially 2, after executing this line, `i` is incremented to 3. Therefore, `preb` is updated to `pathb[0] + pathb[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
