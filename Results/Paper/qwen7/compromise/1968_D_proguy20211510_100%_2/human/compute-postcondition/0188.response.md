Output State: `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list that must have at least as many elements as `k` minus 1, `i` is `len(pathb) - 1`, `curr` is not explicitly defined but can be calculated as `preb + pathb[len(pathb) - 1] * (k - (len(pathb) - 1))`, `resb` is the maximum value of `resb` and `curr` for each iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `preb` will hold the sum of all elements in the `pathb` list. The variable `pres` remains 0. The variable `pathb` must contain enough elements such that `k` does not exceed the length of `pathb`. The variable `i` will be the last index of `pathb`. The variable `curr` represents the value calculated during the last iteration of the loop. Finally, `resb` will hold the maximum value between its initial value and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations.
