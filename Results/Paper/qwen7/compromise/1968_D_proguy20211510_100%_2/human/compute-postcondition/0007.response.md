Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original `n` string to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original `k` string to an integer, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original `pb` string to an integer, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original `ps` string to an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting another input string using `map(int, input().split())**.

Explanation: The code reads a line of input using `input()` and splits it into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `MOD`, `alpha`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
