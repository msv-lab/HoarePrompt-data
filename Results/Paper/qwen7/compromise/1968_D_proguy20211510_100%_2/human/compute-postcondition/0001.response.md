Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, MOD is 1000000007**.

Explanation: The code sets the value of `MOD` to \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common constant used in programming to prevent integer overflow in modular arithmetic operations. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `YES`, and `NO` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, only `MOD` is updated, and the constraints on `t` are preserved.
