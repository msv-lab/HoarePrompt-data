State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1 and the element at index `ps` - 1 set to 1, `i` is the total number of elements added to `pathb` + 1, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, `curr` is the last computed value of `curr` within the loop, `resb` is the same as the previous value if it was updated or the original value otherwise, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `pb` is the final value it takes when the loop breaks, `ps` is the integer value of the fourth element of the input split, `p` is a list containing the integers from the input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `pathb` is a list containing all the elements added during the loop iterations, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis` is updated such that `vis[pb - 1]` is 1**

For a `while True` loop, the loop will always execute the first time since there are no conditions to check before entering the loop. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.
