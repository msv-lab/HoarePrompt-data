Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `ress` is the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop iterations, and `curr` is the last computed value of `curr` within the loop, `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`, and `ress` is greater than `resb`.
