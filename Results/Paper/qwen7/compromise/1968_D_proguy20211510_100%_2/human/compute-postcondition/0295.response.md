Output State: **`resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `pres` is 0, `i` is 4, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. Given that `i` is 4, the expression simplifies to `curr = preb + pathb[4] * (k - 4)`. However, since `preb` is defined as `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, the updated `curr` becomes `pathb[0] + pathb[1] * (k - 1) + pathb[4] * (k - 4)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
