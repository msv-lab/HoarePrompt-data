Postcondition: **`i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, and `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` is updated to `resb`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged.**
