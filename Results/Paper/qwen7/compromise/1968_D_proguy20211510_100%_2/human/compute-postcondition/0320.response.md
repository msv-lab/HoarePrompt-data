Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is `max(ress, paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3))`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is `paths[1] * k + paths[i] + paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3) + paths[6] * (k - 6)`, `i` is 6, `curr` is `paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3) + paths[6] * (k - 6)`**

Explanation: The line `pres += paths[i]` adds the value of `paths[i]` (where `i` is 6) to `pres`. Since `i` is 6, `paths[i]` is `paths[6]`. Therefore, `pres` is updated to `paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3) + paths[6] * (k - 6) + paths[6]`, which simplifies to `paths[1] * k + paths[i] + paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3) + paths[6] * (k - 6)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
