Postcondition: **`i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pathb` is a list, `len(paths)` is a constant, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `curr` is `pres + paths[length_of_paths] * (k - length_of_paths)`, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, and `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. Whether the condition `ress > resb` is true or false, the values of `i`, `preb`, `pathb`, `len(paths)`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `resb` remain as described. Specifically, `ress` will always be the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, and `resb` will be less than or equal to `ress`.
