Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value obtained from the loop's iterations, `ress` is `paths[2] * k`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb` plus the last computed `pathb[i]`, `pres` is `paths[1] * k`, `i` is 3, `curr` is `paths[1] * k + paths[2] * (k - 3)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to be the sum of `pres` and `paths[i] * (k - i)`, where `i` is 3. Given that `pres` is `paths[1] * k` and `paths[i]` is `paths[3]`, the new value of `curr` is `paths[1] * k + paths[3] * (k - 3)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
