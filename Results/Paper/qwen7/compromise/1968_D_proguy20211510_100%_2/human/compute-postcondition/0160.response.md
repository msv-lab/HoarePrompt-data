Output State: `vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is now the final value reached when `vis[pb - 1] == 1`, `ps` is updated to the final value of `ps` after the last iteration of the loop, `curr` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `[a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1], ...]` (where the number of elements is determined by how many times the loop executed until `vis[pb - 1] == 1`), `paths` is a list containing all the elements added during the loop iterations.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `vis[ps - 1]` will still be set to 1 because the loop breaks when `vis[ps - 1]` becomes 1. The variable `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The variable `pb` will be the final value of `ps` when the loop breaks. The variable `ps` will be updated to the final value it reaches before breaking the loop. The variable `curr` and `ress` will hold the maximum value between their initial value (0) and all the `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations. The `pathb` list will contain the elements `[a[pb - 1], a[pb - 1], ...]` where the number of elements is determined by the number of iterations until `vis[pb - 1]` becomes 1. The `paths` list will contain all the elements added during each iteration of the loop.
