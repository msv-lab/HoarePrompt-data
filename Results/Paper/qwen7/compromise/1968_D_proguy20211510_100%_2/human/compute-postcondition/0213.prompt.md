Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list that must have at least as many elements as `k` minus 1, `i` is `len(pathb) - 1`, `curr` is not explicitly defined but represents the last computed value of `curr` in the loop, `resb` is the maximum value accumulated during the loop iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `preb` will hold the sum of all elements in the `pathb` list, `pres` remains 0, `i` will be the index of the last element in `pathb`, `resb` will contain the maximum value of `curr` computed during the loop, and `curr` itself will represent the last computed value within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `pres` is `pres` + `paths[0]` * (`k` - 0), `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3, `k` is less than 4, `curr` is `pres + paths[3] * (k - 3)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[3]`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4, `k` is less than 4, `curr` is `pres + paths[4] * (k - 4)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[4] + paths[4]`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, and `ress` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
