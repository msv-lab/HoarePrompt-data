The function accepts a list of integers `nums` representing the amounts of water in each container. It checks if the water can be distributed equally among the containers. If the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers, it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it iterates through the list, calculating the difference between each container's water amount and the average water amount, ensuring the cumulative difference does not become negative. If the cumulative difference remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it returns 'YES', indicating equal distribution is possible; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
