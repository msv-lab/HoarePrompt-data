Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`; `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `total = sum(nums)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `nums` and assigns it to the variable `total`. The precondition that the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n` remains valid after the execution of the code.
