Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Divisibility Check**: It checks if the sum of the water units in all containers is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'NO', which is correct because making all containers have the same amount of water is impossible if the total sum is not divisible by `n`.
3. **Mean Calculation**: It calculates the mean amount of water each container should have (`mean = total // n`). This is the target amount of water each container should have.
4. **Balance Check**: It iterates through the list of water units and keeps a running balance of the difference between the current sum and the target sum. If at any point the balance goes negative, it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution, so it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Given these points, the program handles all described cases correctly without any edge cases being missed. Therefore, the program is correct.
