Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - **Average Calculation**: It computes the average amount of water per container (`mean`).
   - **Cumulative Difference Check**: It iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a running cumulative difference (`curr`). This difference represents how much more or less water is needed to reach the average. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, so it returns 'NO'.
   - **Final Check**: If the loop completes without the cumulative difference becoming negative, it returns 'YES', indicating that the water can be evenly distributed.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Correctness: **True**
