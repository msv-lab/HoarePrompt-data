Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how it calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create. Specifically:

1. **Initial Calculation**: The program calculates `ans` by assuming that every required difficulty level must be added `m` times, which is incorrect. It should only add the difference between `m` and the count of each required difficulty level, ensuring no overcounting.

2. **Required Difficulties**: The program uses `p = 'ABCDEF'`, but it should include 'G' as well since the problem specifies difficulty levels from 'A' to 'G'.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        # Required difficulties are 'ABCDEFG'
        required_difficulties = 'ABCDEFG'
        
        for i in required_difficulties:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            elif hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that for each required difficulty level, it adds the necessary number of problems to meet the requirement for `m` rounds, without unnecessary overcounting.
