Output State: **`i` is 'C', `p` must be 'ABCDEF', `ans` is `0 + 3*m`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in the string `s`, and the character 'i' is not in the counter `hmp`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was previously `0 + 2*m`. After executing `ans += m`, `ans` is now updated to `0 + 2*m + m`, which simplifies to `0 + 3*m`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
