Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 'A'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEF'
   - If `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is equal to `m`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in p:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`.
   - In the previous iteration, `i` was 'A'.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `p`, the next value of `i` will be the next character in the string `p`.
   - The string `p` is 'ABCDEF'.
   - After the previous iteration where `i` was 'A', the next value of `i` will be 'B'.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The variable `i` will change to 'B'.
   - The variable `p` remains unchanged as it is the iterable in the loop.
   - The condition `if i is not in hmp` and the assignment `ans = m` depend on the current value of `i` and the dictionary `hmp`, but these conditions are not directly modified by the loop itself.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 'B'.
   - `p` remains 'ABCDEF'.
   - The condition `if i is not in hmp` and the assignment `ans = m` will be evaluated based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEF'**
