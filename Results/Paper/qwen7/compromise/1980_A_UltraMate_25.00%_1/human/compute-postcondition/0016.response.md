Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 'B'
   - `p` remains 'ABCDEF'
   - `ans` is `m` since `i` is not in `hmp`

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop iterates over each character in `p`, the next value of `i` will be the next character in the string `p`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - The next character in `p` after 'B' is 'C'.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 'C'.
   - The variable `p` remains unchanged as it is the iterable in the loop.
   - The variable `ans` remains `m` because the condition for updating `ans` (i.e., `i` being in `hmp`) has not been met yet.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is 'C'
   - `p` remains 'ABCDEF'
   - `ans` remains `m`

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 'C', `p` remains 'ABCDEF', and `ans` is `m`**.
