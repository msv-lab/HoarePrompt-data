Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the set `hmp`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `hmp`**:
   - From the output state, we know that `i` cycles through 'F', 'E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A' (in reverse order).
   - We also know that `p` remains 'ABCDEF' and `ans` is 'mmm'.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `hmp`.
   - For each iteration, `i` takes on the value of an element from `hmp`.
   - If `i` is not in `hmp`, `ans` increments by `m`.

4. **Analyze the given information**:
   - The output state indicates that `ans` is 'mmm', which means `ans` has incremented by `m` three times.
   - This implies that `i` must have cycled through all elements of `p` (since `p` is 'ABCDEF'), and none of these elements are in `hmp`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` cycles through 'F', 'E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A', and none of these are in `hmp`, the loop will execute fully.
   - Therefore, `i` must cycle through all these values, and `hmp` should be an empty set or a set that does not contain any of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'F'.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `hmp`.

**State: **`i` cycles through 'F', 'E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A', and `hmp` is an empty set or a set that does not contain any of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', or 'F'.**
