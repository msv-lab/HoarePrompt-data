Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and now `t` is replaced by the integer input value.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    ans = 0
    p = 'ABCDEF'
    hmp = Counter(s)
    for i in p:
        if i not in hmp:
            ans += m
    for i in hmp:
        if hmp[i] < m:
            ans += m - hmp[i]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 'A', `p` remains 'ABCDEF', and `ans` is 'mmmmm'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 'E', `p` must be 'ABCDEF', `ans` is the sum of `0 + 6*m` minus the total number of characters in the string `s` that have a count less than `m`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in the string `s` and includes the keys 'F', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'E', and the character 'i' must be in the counter `hmp`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to the last character in the string `p` which is 'E'. The variable `ans` will be updated to reflect the total adjustment made during each iteration based on the condition `if hmp[i] < m`. Specifically, `ans` starts from `0 + 6*m` and subtracts the difference between `m` and the actual count of each character in `s` that is less than `m`. All other variables like `p`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `hmp` retain their states as they were initially or as they were after the third iteration, with no further changes from the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The value of `ans` is the sum of `m - hmp[i]` for all keys `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`. The variable `i` will be the last key in `hmp` that satisfies the condition `hmp[i] < m`, or it will be 'F' if no such key exists. The variable `p` remains 'ABCDEF', and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `hmp`) remain unchanged.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the total amount by which `m` exceeds the values of all entries in `hmp` that are less than `m`. The variable `i` will point to the last key in `hmp` that was processed, or it will be 'F' if none of the values in `hmp` were less than `m`. The string `p` stays as 'ABCDEF', and the other variables remain in their initial states.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
