Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `ans` is 0, `p` is a string 'ABCDEF', `hmp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`.**

The code creates a `Counter` object named `hmp` which counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `ans`, and `p` remain unchanged.
