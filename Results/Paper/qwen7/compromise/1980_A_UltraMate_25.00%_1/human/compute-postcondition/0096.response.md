Output State: **`i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `hmp` contains at least one element, and the value of `ans` is `m - hmp[i]`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `m - hmp[i]`. Given that `i` is 'F' and `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
