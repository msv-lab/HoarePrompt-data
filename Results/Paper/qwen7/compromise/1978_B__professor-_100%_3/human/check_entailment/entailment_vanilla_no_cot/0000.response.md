Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Case 1:** If `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price) is less than or equal to `a` (the usual price of a bun), then Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is because selling any bun at a lower price would result in a lower total profit. Hence, the profit is `n * a`.

2. **Case 2:** If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, then Bob should sell all `n` buns at the modified prices. The modified price for the `i-th` bun (where `1 ≤ i ≤ k`) is `(b - i + 1)`. Therefore, the total profit is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`, which can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \frac{n(2b - n + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Case 3:** For all other cases, Bob should sell the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`. The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of the arithmetic series from `b` to `b - k + 1`, which is:
   \[
   \text{Profit from first } k \text{ buns} = \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2}
   \]
   The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is `(n - k) * a`. Combining these, the total profit is:
   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2} + a(n - k)
   \]
   To maximize the profit, we need to find the value of `k` that maximizes this expression. However, the given code directly calculates the profit for the optimal `k` without explicitly finding it, which is valid since the formula already accounts for the optimal `k`.

The provided solution handles all these cases correctly and computes the maximum profit efficiently. Therefore, the program is correct.
