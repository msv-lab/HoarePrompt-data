Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`, `dp[i][j]` is `dp[i + 1][j]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the same as `dp[i + 1][j]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new assignment for `dp[i][j]`.
