Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but operates on predefined constraints where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. It also works with a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each integer from 1 through n appears at most 2 times. The function calculates and returns the maximum value achievable for the cell dp[0][0] based on the given conditions.**

This means the function processes data according to specific constraints and computes the maximum value for a particular cell in a dynamic programming table, without needing any explicit input parameters other than those implied by the problem description.
