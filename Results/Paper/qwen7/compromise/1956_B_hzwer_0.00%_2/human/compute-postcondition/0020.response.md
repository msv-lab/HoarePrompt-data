Output State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-2`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of three expressions. However, since the exact values of `i`, `j`, `dp[i+1][j]`, `dp[i+2][j-1]`, `dp[i+1][j+1]`, and the condition regarding the appearance of `j+1` in `cards` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `dp[i][j]`. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of the given expressions. All other variables remain in their initial or previously described states.
