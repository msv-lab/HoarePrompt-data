Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, with the condition that `j` is `n-2`.**

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is now set to the maximum of two expressions: `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, under the condition that `j` is `n-2`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
