Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-2`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` if `j + 1` does not appear more than once in `cards`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])`.**
