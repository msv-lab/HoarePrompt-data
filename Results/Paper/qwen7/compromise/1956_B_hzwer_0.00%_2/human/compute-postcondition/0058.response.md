Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `n-1` to `0`. The loop continues as long as `j` is within the valid range.

3. **Analyze the Postcondition**: The postcondition describes how `dp[i][j]` is calculated based on the value of `j` and the contents of `cards`.

4. **Determine the New State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `dp[i][j]` is calculated based on certain conditions involving `j` and `cards`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be decremented by 1 (since the loop iterates in reverse).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `j` will be decreased by 1.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

Given the above analysis, let's formulate the new state:

- The previous state had `dp[i][j]` calculated based on specific conditions.
- For the next iteration, `j` will be `j - 1`.

Therefore, the new state should reflect this change in `j`.

**State: **`dp[i][j]` is calculated as follows: if the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 1, then `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, with the condition that `j` is `n-2`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`, with the condition that `j` is `n-2`, and `j` is now `j - 1`.**
