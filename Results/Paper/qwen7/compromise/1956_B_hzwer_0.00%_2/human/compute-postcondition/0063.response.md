Postcondition: `dp[i][j]` is calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards`. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 1, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, with the condition that `j` is `n-2`. If the count is not 1, `dp[i][j]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`, with the condition that `j` is `n-2`, and `j` is then decremented by 1.
