Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1); `dp[n - 2][0]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `dp[n - 2][0]` to 0. This updates the specific element in the 2D list `dp`. The initial state of `dp` being a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1) remains unchanged except for the specified element. Additionally, `dp[n - 1][0]` is still 0 as per the initial state.
