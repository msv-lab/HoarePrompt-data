Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `j`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n - 2`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   Since the loop decrements `j` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `n - 3`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `total` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `students_list` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` will be updated to `n - 3`.

5. **Postcondition Adjustment:**
   - The postcondition for `dp[i][j]` needs to be adjusted based on the new value of `j`. Since `j` will be `n - 3`, we need to update the condition accordingly.

Given these points, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n - 3`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]` if `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is equal to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**
