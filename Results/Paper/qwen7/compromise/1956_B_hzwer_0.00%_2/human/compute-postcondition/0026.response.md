Output State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n - 3`, `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]` if `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, otherwise `dp[i][j]` is equal to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`, and `dp[i][j]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][j]`**.

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` has been updated to `dp[i + 1][j]` according to the given condition, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
