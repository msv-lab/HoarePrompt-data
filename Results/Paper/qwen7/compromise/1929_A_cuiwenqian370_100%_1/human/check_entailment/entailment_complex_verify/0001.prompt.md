You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers, where the length of the list is n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is a sorted list of integers, `beauty` is the sum of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the array.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list 'array'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list. It then returns this calculated sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and array is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. The function `func_1` is expected to compute the maximum beauty of the array.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is now the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is equal to `2 * t + 1`, `results` is a list of `t` elements where each element is the result of calling `func_1` on a list of `n` integers.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: the loop prints each element in the `results` list, which contains `t` elements, each resulting from calling `func_1` on a list of `n` integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and a list of `n` integers `array`. It then calls `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty of the array and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the computed maximum beauty for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty can be maximized by sorting the array and calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements after sorting.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting ensures that the differences are minimized between smaller and larger elements, thus maximizing the overall sum of differences.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in a stream and processing each one separately.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the first test case: `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]`. The beauty is `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`.
   - For the second test case: `[69, 69, 69]`, the beauty is `0` since all elements are the same.
   - For the third test case: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The beauty is `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 57`.
   - For the fourth test case: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`, sorting gives `[3, 3, 3, 4]`. The beauty is `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1`.
   - For the fifth test case: `[2, 1]`, sorting gives `[1, 2]`. The beauty is `(2-1) = 1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.
