Output State: **`counter` is incremented by 1, `no` is set to False.**

The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. The value of `no` remains False as there is no operation changing its value. The conditions mentioned in the postcondition (checking if `x` is not in `a[counter]` and `x` is not in `b[counter]`) are not evaluated here, only the increment of `counter` and the state of `no` are updated.
