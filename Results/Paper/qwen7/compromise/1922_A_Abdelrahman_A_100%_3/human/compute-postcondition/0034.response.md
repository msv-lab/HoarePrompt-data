Output State: **`counter` is increased by 1; `c` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter than before; `x` is the next character in `c`; `no` is False.**

The code `counter += 1` increments the value of `counter` by 1. The other variables (`c`, `x`, and `no`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The postcondition that `no` is False also remains valid.
