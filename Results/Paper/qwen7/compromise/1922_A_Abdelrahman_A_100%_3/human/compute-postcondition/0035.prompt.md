Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `counter` is 0, `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from user, `c` is an input string, no is True, and `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
        no = False
        print('YES')
        break
    counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `counter` is increased by 1, `c` is a non-empty string, `no` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `x` is not found in both `a[counter]` and `b[counter]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `counter` is increased by 1; `c` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter than before; `x` is the next character in `c`; `no` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `counter` is increased by 1; `c` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter than before; `x` is the next character in `c`; `no` is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
