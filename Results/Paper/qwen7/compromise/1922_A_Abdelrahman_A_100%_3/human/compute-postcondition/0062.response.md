Output State: **`counter` is incremented by 1, `no` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `counter` and `no` remain unchanged.
