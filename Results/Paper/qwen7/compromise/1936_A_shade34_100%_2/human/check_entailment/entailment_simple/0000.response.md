### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair**:
   - The program attempts to find the maximum XOR value by comparing pairs of indices.
   - It starts by comparing `mak` with each index from 1 to `n-1`. This step is intended to find the index that gives the highest XOR when compared to itself.
   - After finding `mak`, it compares `mak` with all indices again to find potential candidates for the second index (`pans`).
   - Then, it compares these candidates to refine the second index (`pans[mak]`).

3. **Query Execution**:
   - The program prints queries in the form `? a b c d` to compare different pairs of indices.
   - It uses the results of these comparisons to update the indices and find the optimal pair.

4. **Output**:
   - Once the optimal pair is found, it prints the answer in the form `! i j`.
   - The program ensures that it does not exceed the allowed number of queries (3n).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when `mak` is already the best candidate, and it correctly updates the list `pans` to include indices that give the same XOR value.
   - The final comparison ensures that the selected pair indeed gives the maximum XOR value.

6. **Flushing Output**:
   - The program flushes the output after each query and the final answer, ensuring that the input/output operations are handled correctly.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to follow the problem description accurately and performs the necessary steps to find the maximum XOR pair within the allowed number of queries. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions in the code.

### Correctness:
**True**
