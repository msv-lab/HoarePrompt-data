Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - The program attempts to find the index `mak` such that `(p_mak | p_mak)` is maximized by comparing it with `(p_i | p_i)` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-1`.
   - This part seems to be an attempt to identify the index with the highest single-bit OR value, but it doesn't fully utilize the information from the comparisons.

3. **Finding Potential Candidates:**
   - After identifying `mak`, the program then checks all indices against `mak2` (which is initially set to `mak`) to find potential candidates for the maximum XOR.
   - It uses a list `pans` to store indices that have a bitwise OR value equal to `(mak | mak2)`.

4. **Refining the Candidates:**
   - The program then refines the candidates by checking pairs within `pans` to find the maximum XOR.
   - However, the logic here is flawed. It compares pairs of indices within `pans` and tries to find the pair with the highest XOR, but it doesn't necessarily ensure that the pair found is the one with the maximum XOR overall.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program outputs the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` as the pair with the maximum XOR.
   - This output is not guaranteed to be correct because the refinement step might not correctly identify the pair with the maximum XOR.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Approach to Finding Maximum XOR:**
   - The initial approach to finding `mak` is not optimal and doesn't guarantee the correct index.
   - The refinement step within `pans` is also flawed and doesn't ensure the correct pair is identified.

2. **Query Count:**
   - The program makes more than 3n queries in some cases, which violates the constraint of making at most 3n queries.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct according to the problem constraints and requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
