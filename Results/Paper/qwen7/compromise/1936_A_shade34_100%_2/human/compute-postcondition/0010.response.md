Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `mak` is 1 (though `mak` is not part of the loop head, it is mentioned in the postcondition)
   - The input string is "<" (though the input string is not part of the loop head)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` must remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` should be 2.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `mak` and the input string are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration**
