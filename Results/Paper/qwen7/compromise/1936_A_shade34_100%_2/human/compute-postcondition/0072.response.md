Output State: **`mak` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is that `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.
