Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is `len(pans) - 2`: This means `mak` is the length of the list `pans` minus 2.
   - `i` is `len(pans) - 1`: This means `i` is one less than the length of the list `pans`.
   - `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`: This means `pans` is a list starting from `n-1` and ending at `0`.
   - `mak2` is `0`: This means `mak2` is explicitly set to `0`.
   - `n` is an input integer: This is a variable representing an integer input.
   - The current value of the input string is `<`: This is not directly relevant to the print statement but might be part of a larger context.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

Given the initial state:
- `mak` is `len(pans) - 2`.
- `i` is `len(pans) - 1`.

Since `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, the length of `pans` is `n`. Therefore:
- `mak` is `n - 2`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.

So, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a literal string).
- `mak`, which is `n - 2`.
- `mak` again, which is `n - 2`.
- `i`, which is `n - 1`.
- `i` again, which is `n - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? n-2 n-2 n-1 n-1'**
