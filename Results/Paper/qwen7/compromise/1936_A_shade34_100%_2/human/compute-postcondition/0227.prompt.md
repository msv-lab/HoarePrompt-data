Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mak2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is an empty list, and `mak` is `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string input by the user. If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is equal to `i`, and `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. If `s` is not equal to '<' but is equal to '=', `pans` has appended the value of `i`. If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `s` is a string input by the user, and `pans` is a list. If `s` equals '<', no change is made to `pans`. If `s` equals '=', `pans` is updated to include the element `i_prev + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `s` is the new string input by the user, `pans` is a list with the value of `i` appended, and the standard output buffer is flushed. If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is equal to `i`; otherwise, `pans` contains the value of `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
