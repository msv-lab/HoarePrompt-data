Based on the initial state provided:
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3 but its exact value is not specified.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a literal string that will be printed.
- `mak` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.

Since `mak` is undefined, we cannot provide its value. Therefore, the output will include the literal string `'?'` followed by `mak` twice, and then the value of `i` which is 3, repeated twice.

Output: **'? mak mak 3 3'**
