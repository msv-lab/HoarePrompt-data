Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive
- `mak2` is `n-1`
- The current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (it could be either '<' or '=' for the next iteration)
- `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `2*n-1` times
- The condition `s == '>'` is false based on the input received during the last iteration

The print statement is:
```python
print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `mak2` is `n-1`
- `pans[mak]` refers to the element in the list `pans` at index `mak`. Since `mak` is `n-1`, `pans[mak]` is the last element in the list `pans`, which is `n-1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'!'` followed by the value of `mak2` and the value of `pans[mak]`.

Output: **! n-1 n-1**
