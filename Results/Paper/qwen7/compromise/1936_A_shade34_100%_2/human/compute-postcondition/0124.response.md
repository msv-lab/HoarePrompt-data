Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is 0
- `i` is 1
- `pans` is `[0]`
- `mak2` is `n-1`
- The current value of the input string `s` is `<`
- `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n` times
- The condition `s == '<'` is true

The `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)` statement will print the following:

- `'?'` is a string literal.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is `n-1`.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak2` is again `n-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'? 0 n-1 1 n-1'**
