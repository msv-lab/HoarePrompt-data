Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

This is because the function definition provided does not include any parameters, and there are no parameters mentioned in the constraints. The task description only provides information about the constraints on `t` and `n`, but these do not affect the function itself since the function definition does not reference them. Therefore, the function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything.
