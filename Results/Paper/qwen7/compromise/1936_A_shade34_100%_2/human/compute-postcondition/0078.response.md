Output State: **`mak` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or create new ones. It only ensures that all buffered output is written to the standard output. Since no variables are modified, the values of `mak`, `i`, `pans`, and `mak2` remain unchanged. The execution of `sys.stdout.flush()` itself is noted but does not affect the variable states.
