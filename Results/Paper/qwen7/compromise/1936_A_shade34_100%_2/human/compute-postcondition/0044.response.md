Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a new string from input, `pans` is a list containing `[i]`, `mak` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pans = [i]` updates the list `pans` to contain the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `pans` now contains `[n]`. The other variables (`n`, `s`, and `mak`) remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
