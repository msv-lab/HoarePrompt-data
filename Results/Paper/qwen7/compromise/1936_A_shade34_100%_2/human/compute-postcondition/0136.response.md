Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not modify any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any buffered data is written to the standard output immediately. Since no variables are affected by this operation, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 is also preserved.
