Postcondition: `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, `mak2` is `n-1`, and the current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (it could be either '<' or '=' for the next iteration). If the input string `s` is '<', then `mak` remains `n-1`, `i` remains `n-1`, and `s` is updated to the new input from the user.
