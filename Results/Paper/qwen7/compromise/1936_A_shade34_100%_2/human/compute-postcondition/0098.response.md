Output State: **`mak` is `len(pans) - 2`, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and the current value of the input string is '<', `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**

Explanation: The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not change any variable values but ensures that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
