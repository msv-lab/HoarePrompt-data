Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - The output state remains unchanged.
   - The input string is read.
   - If the input string is `<`, then `mak` is equal to `i`.
   - No other variables are affected.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `mak` is only set to `i` if the input string is `<`, but since the output state remains unchanged, `mak` does not change.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The input string is still read.
   - If the input string was `<` in the previous iteration, `mak` would be updated to the value of `i` from the previous iteration, but since the output state remains unchanged, `mak` does not change.
   - Therefore, `mak` remains unchanged unless the input string is `<` again, but since the output state remains unchanged, `mak` does not change.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **The output state remains unchanged, the input string is read, `mak` remains unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same**.
