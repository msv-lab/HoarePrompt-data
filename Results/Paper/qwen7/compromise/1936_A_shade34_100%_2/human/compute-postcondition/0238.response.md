Output State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, and `len(pans)` must be `n`.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only ensures that any buffered data in the standard output buffer is written out immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
