Output State: **`mak` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `len(pans) - 1` times.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It only ensures that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
