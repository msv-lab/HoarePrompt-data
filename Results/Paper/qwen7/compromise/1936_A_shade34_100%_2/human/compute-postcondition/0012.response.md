Output State: **`i` is 2**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` or `n`. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any print statements before this line are displayed immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or modified by this line of code, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
