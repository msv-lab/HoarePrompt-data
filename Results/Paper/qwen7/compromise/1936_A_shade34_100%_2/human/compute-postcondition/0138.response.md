Output State: **`i` is 3, `mak` is 3**

Explanation: The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid, but since no operations were performed on `n`, its value is not specified in the output state. The input string `s` is also not affected by the given code snippet.
