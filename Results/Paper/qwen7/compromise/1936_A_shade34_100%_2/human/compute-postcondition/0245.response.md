Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` simply assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. The values of `n`, `i`, and the list `pans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state retains the same conditions as the initial state.
