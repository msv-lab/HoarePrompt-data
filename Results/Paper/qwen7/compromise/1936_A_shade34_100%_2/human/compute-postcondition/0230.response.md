Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `mak` is equal to `i`, which means `mak` is also `n-1`.
   - `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive. This means `pans` is a list like `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-2, n-1]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Values Calculation**:
   - Since `mak` is `n-1`, `pans[mak]` is the last element of the list `pans`, which is `n-1`.
   - Since `i` is `n-1`, `pans[i]` is also the last element of the list `pans`, which is `n-1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the value of `pans[mak]` (which is `n-1`) twice, and then the value of `pans[i]` (which is also `n-1`).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? n-1 n-1 n-1 n-1'**
