Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `mak` is assigned the value of `i`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is assigned the value of `n + 1`.
   - `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.
   - The length of `pans` is `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, let's assume `n = 3` for simplicity (the actual value does not affect the logic as long as it is greater than 0).
   - Therefore, `i` would be `n + 1`, so if `n = 3`, then `i = 4`.
   - `pans` would be a list containing the values from 0 to `n-1`, so if `n = 3`, `pans` would be `[0, 1, 2]`.

3. **Values of `mak` and `i`**:
   - `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, so `mak` is `4`.
   - `i` is `4`.

4. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

5. **Execution of the Code**:
   - `pans[mak]` refers to `pans[4]`, but since `pans` only contains indices from 0 to 2, this will raise an IndexError if we try to access `pans[4]`.
   - However, based on the precondition, we should consider the valid indices of `pans`, which are 0, 1, and 2.
   - Similarly, `pans[i]` refers to `pans[4]`, which again will raise an IndexError.

Given the precondition and the fact that `pans` only contains indices from 0 to 2, the correct interpretation is that the code will raise an error due to invalid indexing. But if we were to strictly follow the given conditions and assume the list is correctly defined up to `n-1`, the intended values would be:

- `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]` would both refer to out-of-bound indices, leading to an error.

However, adhering to the format and the instructions, we describe the intended values:

Output: **'? [out_of_bound_value] [out_of_bound_value] [out_of_bound_value] [out_of_bound_value]** (where out_of_bound_value indicates an invalid index for the list `pans`).
