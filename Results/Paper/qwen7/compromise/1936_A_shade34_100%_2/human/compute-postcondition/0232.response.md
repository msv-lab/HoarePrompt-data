Postcondition: **`mak` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is equal to `i` (which is `n-1`), `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, and `len(pans)` must be `n`. The input string is '>', and no other changes have been made to the variables since the if condition was entered.**
