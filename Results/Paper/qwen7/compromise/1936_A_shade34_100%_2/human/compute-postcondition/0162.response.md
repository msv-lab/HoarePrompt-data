Output State: **`mak` is 2, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to n-1 inclusive, `mak2` is n-1, the current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (it could be either '<' or '=' for the next iteration), `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called 2*n-1 times, and the condition `s == '>'` is false based on the input received during the last iteration.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or conditions. It simply flushes the output buffer. Therefore, all the previous states remain unchanged.
