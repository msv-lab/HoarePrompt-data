Output State: **`mak` is `len(pans) - 1`, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and the current value of the input string is '<', `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` updates the value of `mak` to be the same as the current value of `i`. Since `i` was initially set to `len(pans) - 1`, `mak` is now also `len(pans) - 1`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
