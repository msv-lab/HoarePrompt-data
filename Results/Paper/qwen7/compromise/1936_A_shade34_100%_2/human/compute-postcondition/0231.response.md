The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed content is displayed immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or modified, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`mak` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is equal to `i` (which is `n-1`), `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, and `len(pans)` must be `n`.**
