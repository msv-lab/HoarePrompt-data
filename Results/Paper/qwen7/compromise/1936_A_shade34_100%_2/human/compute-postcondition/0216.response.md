Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - `pans` is a list.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration (`i = i_prev + 1`), in the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i_prev + 2` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 0).

6. **Consider the effect of `s`**:
   - If `s` equals '<', no change is made to `pans`.
   - If `s` equals '=', `pans` is updated to include the element `i_prev + 1`. However, this update does not affect the loop condition or the values of `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `s` is a string input by the user, and `pans` is a list.**
