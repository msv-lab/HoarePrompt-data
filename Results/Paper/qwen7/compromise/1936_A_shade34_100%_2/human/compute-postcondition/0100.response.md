Postcondition: **`mak` is `len(pans) - 1`, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and the current value of the input string is '<', `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because the if part does not change any of the variables' values or relationships, and there is no else part to consider.
