Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `mak` is the maximum value between `n-1` and 1, and `n` remains as the input integer provided initially.**

Explanation: The line `mak2 = mak` simply assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. No other changes occur to the variables. Therefore, `mak2` now holds the same value as `mak`, which is the maximum value between `n-1` and 1, `i` is still `n-1`, and `n` remains unchanged.
