Postcondition: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 1, `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to n-1 inclusive, `mak2` is n-1, the current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (it could be either '<' or '=' for the last iteration), `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called 2*n-1 times, and the condition `s == '>'` is true based on the input received during the last iteration.**
