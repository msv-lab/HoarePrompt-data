Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`. Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, let's assume `n` is a positive integer. For example, if `n = 3`, then `pans` would be `[2, 1, 0]`.
   - `mak2` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Evaluation:**
   - `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` is the same as `pans[0]`. If `n = 3`, then `pans[0]` is `2`.
   - `pans[i]`: Since `i` is 1, `pans[i]` is the same as `pans[1]`. If `n = 3`, then `pans[1]` is `1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`, repeated twice.
   - Therefore, the output will be `'? 2 2 1 1'` if `n = 3`.

Output: **'? 2 2 1 1'** (assuming `n = 3`; the exact output will depend on the value of `n`, but the structure will be the same)
