Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `s` is a new string from input.
   - `pans` is a list containing either `[i]` or `[i, n]` depending on whether `s` is equal to '<' or not.
   - `mak` is equal to `i` if `s` is not '<', or equal to `n` if `s` is '<'.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `n`.
- `mak` is `i` if `s` is not '<', or `n` if `s` is '<'.
- `mak2` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is mentioned in the print statement. Since `mak2` is not defined elsewhere, we assume it is the same as `mak`.

Now, let's consider the two cases for `s`:
- If `s` is not '<', then `mak` is `i` and `mak2` is also `i`.
- If `s` is '<', then `mak` is `n` and `mak2` is also `n`.

Given this, the print statement will output one of the following:
- If `s` is not '<': `? i i n i`
- If `s` is '<': `? n n n n`

Since the exact value of `s` is not specified, both cases are valid. However, we need to provide the most precise description based on the given information.

Output: **'? [i] [i] [n] [i]' or '? [n] [n] [n] [n]' (where i is the value of n and n is greater than 0)**
