Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. Since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), the input will be within this range. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value is within this range for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: Given that `t` is the integer input, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range for the loop to execute.

So, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that the input value (which will be assigned to the loop variable) is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
