The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s` is a string input by the user. The values of `mak`, `pans`, and `i` depend on the value of `s`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is some integer value (let's say `i_prev`).

At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i_prev + 1`.

Since the postcondition does not specify any changes to `n` within the loop, `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 1`**
