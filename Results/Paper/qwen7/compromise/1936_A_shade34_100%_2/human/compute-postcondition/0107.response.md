Output State: `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `n` is an input integer, the current value of the input string is `<`, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n` times.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Given that the condition inside the loop always evaluates to `True` (as indicated by the output states after each iteration), `mak` will be updated to the current value of `i` on each iteration. After `n-1` iterations, `i` becomes `n-1`, and `mak` also becomes `n-1`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `mak` and `i` will both be equal to `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
