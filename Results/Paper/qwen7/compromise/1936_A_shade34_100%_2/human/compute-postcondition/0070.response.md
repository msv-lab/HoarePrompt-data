Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `pans`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is either 0 or 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`.
   - `mak2` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(pans)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.
   - The length of `pans` does not change within the loop, so `pans` remains the same list of integers from `n-1` to `0`.

5. **Consider the postcondition**: The value of `mak` and `mak2` do not change within the loop based on the given information, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`mak` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0**.
