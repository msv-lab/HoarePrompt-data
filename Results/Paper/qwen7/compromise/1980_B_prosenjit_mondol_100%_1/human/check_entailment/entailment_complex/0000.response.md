Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k`, and the list `a` of integers.
3. It adjusts the index of the favorite cube `f` and the removal count `k` to be zero-based.
4. The list `a` is sorted in descending order.
5. The function then compares the `k`-th largest element in the sorted list with the `f`-th element.
6. If the `k`-th largest element is greater than the `f`-th element, it prints 'NO'.
7. If the `k`-th largest element is less than the `f`-th element, it prints 'YES'.
8. If the `k`-th and `f`-th elements are equal, it prints 'YES' unless the `k`-th element is the second last element in the list and the next element is also equal to the `f`-th element, in which case it prints 'MAYBE'.

Given the provided examples and the logic implemented in the function, the function appears to handle all the conditions correctly as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
