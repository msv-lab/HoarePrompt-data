You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES', 'NO', and 'MAYBE' based on the comparison between the k-th largest element and the f-th element in the sorted list of integers provided for each test case. For each test case, the values of `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are read from input, and the program checks if the k-th largest element in the sorted list is greater than, less than, or equal to the f-th element. If the k-th largest element is greater, it prints 'NO'. If it is less, it prints 'YES'. If they are equal, it prints 'YES' unless the k-th element is the second last element in the list and the next element (k+1) is also equal to the f-th element, in which case it prints 'MAYBE'. This process repeats for each test case provided in the input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` (number of cubes, index of the favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes).
   - It also reads the values `a` shown on the cubes.
   
2. **Adjusting Indexes:**
   - The favorite cube index `f` and the number of removed cubes `k` are adjusted by subtracting 1 because indexing in Python starts at 0.

3. **Sorting the Values:**
   - The values `a` are sorted in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Comparing Values:**
   - The value of the favorite cube after sorting is stored in `x`.
   - The value of the `k`-th cube after sorting is compared with `x`:
     - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube is not removed, so the program prints `'NO'`.
     - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube is definitely removed, so the program prints `'YES'`.
     - If `a[k] == x`, the program checks further conditions:
       - If `k` is the last index (`n - 1`), the favorite cube is definitely removed, so the program prints `'YES'`.
       - Otherwise, the program checks if the `(k + 1)`-th cube is less than `x`. If true, the favorite cube is removed, so the program prints `'YES'`. Otherwise, it prints `'MAYBE'`.

### Verification Against Examples

Let's verify the logic with some examples from the provided test cases:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `5 2 2`
   - `a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`
   - `x = 3` (value of the favorite cube)
   - `a[1] = 3` (second cube after sorting)
   - Since `a[1] == x`, we need to check further:
     - `k = 1` (not the last index, and `a[2] = 3` which is not less than `x`)
     - Output: `MAYBE`

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 3`
   - `a = [4, 2, 1, 3, 5]`
   - Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `x = 1` (value of the favorite cube)
   - `a[2] = 3` (third cube after sorting)
   - Since `a[2] > x`, Output: `NO`

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `5 5 2`
   - `a = [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `x = 1` (value of the favorite cube)
   - `a[1] = 4` (second cube after sorting)
   - Since `a[1] > x`, Output: `NO`

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 5`
   - `a = [1, 2, 5, 4, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `x = 1` (value of the favorite cube)
   - `a[4] = 1` (fifth cube after sorting)
   - Since `a[4] == x` and `k` is the last index, Output: `YES`
