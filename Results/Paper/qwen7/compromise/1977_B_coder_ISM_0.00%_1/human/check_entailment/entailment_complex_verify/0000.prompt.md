You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: Output State: `i` is 30, `length` is 31, `flag` is 1, `s[0]` is '-1', `s[1]` is '0', `s[2]` is '0', for all `i` from 3 to 28, `s[i]` is '0', `s[29]` is '1', `s[30]` is '1', and `s[31]` is '0'.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have completed, the value of `i` will be 30 because the loop increments `i` starting from 1 and continues until it can no longer find a pair where `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1'. The final modification to the list `s` occurs when `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', changing `s[29]` to '1' and appending '1' to the list, increasing `length` to 31. The rest of the elements in `s` remain unchanged based on the provided rules.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) and another positive integer \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) < 2^30). For each test case, it converts \( x \) into its binary representation, modifies the binary string according to specific rules, and prints the modified binary string along with its length. The final state of the program includes printing the modified binary string and its length for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate an array that satisfies the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\).

Consider the test case \(x = 14\). The program generates the output:
```
5
0 -1 0 0 1
```
This output is correct as it satisfies the sum condition and the constraint on consecutive non-zero elements. However, consider another test case \(x = 18\). The program generates the output:
```
5
0 0 0 1 1
```
This output is incorrect because it violates the constraint that there should not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). Here, \(a_3 = 1\) and \(a_4 = 1\), which violates the constraint.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
