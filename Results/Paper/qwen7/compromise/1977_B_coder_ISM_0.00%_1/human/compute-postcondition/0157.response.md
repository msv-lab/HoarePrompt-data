Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` remains unchanged, `s` is updated such that `s[1]` is now '-1'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` updates the element at index `i` of the list `s` to be `'-'1'`. Given that `i` is 1, the first character of the string `s` (if `s` is treated as a string) is changed to `'-'1'`. The value of `i` remains 1, and the value of `flag` remains unchanged as per the conditions specified.
