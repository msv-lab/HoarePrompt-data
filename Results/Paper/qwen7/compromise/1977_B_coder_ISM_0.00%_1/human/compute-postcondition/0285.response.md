Output State: **`i` is 28, `flag` is 1, and the string `s` now has its 30th character (s[29]) set to '0'.**

Explanation: The initial state of `i` is 28 and `flag` is 1. The string `s` has not had any characters changed to '0' or from '0' to '1' because `flag` is 1. The code snippet `s[29] = '0'` changes the 30th character of the string `s` to '0'. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged.
