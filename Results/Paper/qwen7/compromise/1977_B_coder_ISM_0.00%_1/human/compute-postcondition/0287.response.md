Output State: **`i` is 28, `flag` is 1, and the length is increased by 1, making it 29, and the string `s` now has its 30th character (s[29]) set to '1'.**

The code `length += 1` increments the value of the variable `length` by 1. Given that `length` was not previously defined, it is assumed to be 0 before this operation. After the increment, `length` becomes 1. Since the initial value of `i` is 28, `flag` remains 1, and the 30th character of the string `s` is set to '1', these values remain unchanged.
