Output State: **`i` is 28, `flag` is 1, and the string `s` now ends with '1' instead of '0'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s[29] = '1'` changes the 30th character (index 29) of the string `s` from '0' to '1'. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being 28, `flag` being 1, and the last character of `s` being '1'.
