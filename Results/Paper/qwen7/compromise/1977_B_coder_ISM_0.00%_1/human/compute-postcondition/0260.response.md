Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is a boolean, `s` is a string such that the character at index 1 of `s` is '-1'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s[i] = '-1'` changes the character at index `i` (which is 1) of the string `s` to '-1'. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `flag` remains a boolean, and the character at index 1 of `s` is now '-1'.
