Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', `s[1]` is equal to `s[0]`, and `s[i]` (which is `s[1]`) is '1'.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `flag` remains either 0 or 1. The value of `s[0]` remains either '0' or '1'. Since `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]` if `flag` is 1, and equal to `s[1]` if `flag` is 0, and given that `s[i]` (which is `s[1]`) is now explicitly set to '1', `s[1]` is also '1'.
