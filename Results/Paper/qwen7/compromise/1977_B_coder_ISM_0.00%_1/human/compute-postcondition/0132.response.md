Explanation: 
- The initial value of `i` is 29.
- The list `s` is initialized with 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0'.
- Each element in `s` is determined by the condition `x & pow(2, i)`. Since `i` starts from 29 and decreases to 0 over 30 iterations, and considering `x` is an integer, the condition `x & pow(2, i)` will always evaluate to 0 for any integer `x` because `pow(2, i)` for `i` ranging from 29 to 0 will produce values that are powers of 2, which are greater than any typical integer `x` (assuming `x` is within a standard integer range like 0 to 2^31-1). Therefore, the condition will never be true, and each element in `s` will be '0'.
- After the loop, `s` will contain 30 elements, all set to '0'.
- The `print(*s)` statement will print these elements separated by spaces.
