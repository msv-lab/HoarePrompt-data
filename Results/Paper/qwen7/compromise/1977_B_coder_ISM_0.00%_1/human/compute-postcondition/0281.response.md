Postcondition: **`i` is 28, `flag` is 1, and the string `s` has been modified such that for every pair of consecutive characters in `s` where both are '1', the first character of the pair is changed to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. When `flag` is 1, the next character is set to '0'. If `flag` is 0 and the current character is '0', it is changed to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. Additionally, the current value of `s[29]` is '0' and `flag` is 1.**
