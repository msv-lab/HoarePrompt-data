Output State: `i` is 3, `length` is at least 29, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[0]` is '-1', `s[1]` is '1', `s[2]` is '0', for all `i` from 3 to 28, `s[i]` is '0', `s[29]` is '1', and `s[30]` is '1'.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be 3 because the loop increments `i` starting from 1 and continues until it can no longer find a pair where `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1'. Given the initial conditions and the output state after 3 iterations, we know that the only change made by the loop was setting `s[1]` to '-1' and `s[2]` to '0' during the second iteration. Since no further changes were made in subsequent iterations, the final state remains with `i` as 3, `length` being at least 29, `flag` unchanged, and the specified values for `s`.
