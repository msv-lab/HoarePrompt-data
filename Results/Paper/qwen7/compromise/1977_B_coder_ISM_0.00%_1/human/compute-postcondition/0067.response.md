Output State: **`i` is 2, `flag` is 1, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', `s[1]` is equal to `s[0]`, `s[2]` is '-1'**.

The value of `flag` is explicitly set to 1, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `i` remains 2, `flag` changes to 1, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', `s[1]` is still equal to `s[0]`, and `s[2]` is updated to '-1'.
