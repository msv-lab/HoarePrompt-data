Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 33, `x` is an input integer, `s` is `['1', '1']`**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` is either `['1']` or `['0']` depending on the condition `x & pow(2, i) > 0`. Since the code simply appends `'1'` to `s`, regardless of the initial value of `s`, it will become `['1', '1']` after the append operation. The values of `i`, `length`, `nalla`, and `x` remain unchanged.
