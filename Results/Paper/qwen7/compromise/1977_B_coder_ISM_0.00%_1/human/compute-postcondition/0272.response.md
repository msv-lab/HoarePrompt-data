Output State: **`i` is 2; `flag` is a boolean; `s` is a string such that the character at index 1 of `s` is now '-'**.

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the character at index `i` of the string `s` to '-1'. Given that `i` is 2, the character at index 2 (which is the third character) of the string `s` is changed to '-1'. The values of `flag` and the character at index 1 of `s` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
