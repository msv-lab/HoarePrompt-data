Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 33, `x` is an input integer, `s` is ['0', '0']**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` is either `['1']` or `['0']` based on the condition `if x & pow(2, i) > 0`. After appending `'0'`, `s` becomes `['0', '0']`. The values of `i`, `length`, `nalla`, and `x` remain unchanged.
