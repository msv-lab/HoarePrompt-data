Output State: **`i` is 2; `flag` is a boolean; the character at index 1 of `s` is '0';**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '0'` changes the character at index `i` (which is 2) of the string `s` to '0'. Since `i` is 2, this directly modifies the second character of the string `s`. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged.
