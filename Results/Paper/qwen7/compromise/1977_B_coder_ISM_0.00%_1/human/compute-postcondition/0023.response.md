Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements. Each element in `s` is either '1' or '0', depending on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set (1) or not (0).**

In more detail, after the loop completes all 30 iterations, `s` will be a list of 30 characters, where each character is either '1' or '0'. The value '1' appears in `s` if and only if the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set to 1. For example, if `x` is the decimal number 45, which is 101101 in binary, then `s` would be `['0', '1', '0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']`. The length of the list `s` remains 30, as specified in the initial state.
