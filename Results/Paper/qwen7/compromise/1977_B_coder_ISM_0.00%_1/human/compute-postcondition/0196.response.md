Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `1` to `length-1` (since `range(1, length)` generates numbers from 1 to `length-1`). Therefore, the loop continues as long as `i < length`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 29.
   - `length` is greater than 29.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Hence, `i` will become 30.
   - The condition `i < length` must still hold true, meaning `length` must still be greater than 30.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The value of `i` changes from 29 to 30.
   - The value of `length` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 30.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 30, `length` is greater than 30**.
