Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `length`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < 30`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 30.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `length` is 30
   - `flag` is either 0 or 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `s` is either `['1']` or `['0']` (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `t` is increased by 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `x` is an input integer (this variable is not part of the loop head)

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < 30`, if `i` is currently 0, it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The value of `i` should be updated to 1.
   - All other variables (`length`, `flag`, `s`, `t`, `x`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` is now 1
   - `length` remains 30
   - `flag` remains either 0 or 1
   - `s` remains either `['1']` or `['0']`
   - `t` remains increased by 1
   - `x` remains an input integer

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s` is either `['1']` or `['0']`, `t` is increased by 1, and `x` is an input integer**
