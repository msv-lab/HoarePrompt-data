Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing '0', `i` is 0**.

The code `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially an empty list, after appending `'0'`, `s` becomes a list containing `'0'`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
