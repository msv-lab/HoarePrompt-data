Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is the first integer input converted to an integer.
   - `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers with at least one element remaining.
   - `n` is the next element in `qs`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `res` list contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `func_1(n, p)`. This means `res` has two elements: the result of `func_1(n, p)` and itself again.
   - When `map(str, res)` is applied, it converts each element of `res` to a string.
   - `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these string representations with a space in between.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Let's assume `func_1(n, p)` returns some value, say `x`. Therefore, `res` would be `[x, x]`.
   - `' '.join(map(str, [x, x]))` would convert `x` to a string and join them with a space, resulting in `"x x"`.

Given this reasoning, the output of the print statement will be the string representation of the elements in `res` separated by a space.

Output: **x x (where x is the result of func_1(n, p))**
