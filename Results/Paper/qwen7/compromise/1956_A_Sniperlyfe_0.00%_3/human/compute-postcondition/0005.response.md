Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string into an integer. This new list of integers is assigned to the variable `qs`. The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
