Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `qs` will be empty, as all its elements will have been processed. The variable `res` will be a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element `n` in `qs`, in the order they appeared. The variables `k` and `q` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, with `k` being the value of `k` from the last input and `q` being the count of elements originally in `qs`. The variable `p` will remain unchanged, being the list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers during the last iteration. The variable `n` will be the last element in the original `qs` list that was used in the loop.

In summary, `qs` is empty, `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for all `n` in the original `qs`, `p` remains the same list from the last input, `k` and `q` hold the values from the last iteration, and `n` is the last element from the original `qs`.
