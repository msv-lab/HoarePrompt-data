You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k and q are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100. p is a list of k positive integers representing the sequence a where 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100. qs is a list of q positive integers representing n_i where 1 <= n_i <= 100.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = []
        
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `qs` will be an empty list, `n` will be the last element that was processed, which is the last element in the original `qs` list, `res` will be a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each `n` in `qs` in the order they appeared, `k` will be the value it was initialized to at the start of the loop, and `p` will be the list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `qs` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The variable `n` will hold the last element of the original `qs` list. The `res` list will contain the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each `n` in `qs`, meaning it will have one entry for each element in `qs`. The variables `k` and `p` will retain their initial values from the first iteration of the loop, as they are not modified within the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters k, q, p (a list of k positive integers), and qs (a list of q positive integers). It checks each element in qs to see if it exists in the sequence p. If any element in qs is found in p, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
