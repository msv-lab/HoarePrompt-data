Output State: **`k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with `func_1(n, p)`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers with at least one element remaining, `n` is the next element in `qs`**.

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Since `n` is the next element in `qs`, the value of `n` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their previous values, and `res` now includes the new value of `func_1(n, p)`.
