Output State: **`res` now contains the result of `func_1(res[-1], p)` appended, and `n` is the next element in `qs`.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Here, `n` is the next element in `qs`, and `p` is assumed to remain unchanged. After appending, the last element in `res` is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, which means `res` now contains the new result appended to its previous contents. The variable `n` remains as the next element in `qs`.
