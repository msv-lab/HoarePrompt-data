Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` must contain at least two elements.
- `n` is the second element in `qs`.
- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `n` is the second element of `qs`.
2. `res` is a list with one element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

The `map(str, res)` function converts the single element in `res` to a string. Then, `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these strings with a space in between.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the string representation of the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **'result_of_func_1(n, p)' (where result_of_func_1(n, p) is the result of the function call func_1(n, p))**
