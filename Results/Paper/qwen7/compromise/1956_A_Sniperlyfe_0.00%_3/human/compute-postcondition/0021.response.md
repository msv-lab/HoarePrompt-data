Output State: **`k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is an empty list, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

The code initializes the list `res` to an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
