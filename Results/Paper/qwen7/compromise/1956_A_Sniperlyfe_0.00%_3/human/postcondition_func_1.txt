The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers \( k \) and \( q \), followed by a list \( p \) of \( k \) positive integers and a list \( qs \) of \( q \) positive integers. It then applies another function `func_1` to each element in \( qs \) to check if it exists in \( p \). The result of each check is stored in a list `res`. After processing all elements in \( qs \), it prints the contents of `res` for each test case. Finally, the function returns nothing, as it only prints the results and does not return any value.
