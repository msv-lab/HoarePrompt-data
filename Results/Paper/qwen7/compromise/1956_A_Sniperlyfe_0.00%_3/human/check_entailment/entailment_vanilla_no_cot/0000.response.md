To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and ensure it matches the problem description.

### Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes two arguments: `n` (number of players) and `p` (the sequence of positions to remove players).
   - It iteratively removes players from the line until no more players can be removed.
   - The logic inside the function seems to correctly implement the game's rules:
     - `while n >= min(p):` ensures that the loop runs as long as there are enough players to remove according to the smallest position in `p`.
     - `n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))` subtracts the number of players that can be removed in the current round from `n`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - For each initial player count `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to get the number of winners and appends the result to `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Verification:

- The logic in `func_1` appears to correctly simulate the game's rules.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the game's rules and processes the test cases as required.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
