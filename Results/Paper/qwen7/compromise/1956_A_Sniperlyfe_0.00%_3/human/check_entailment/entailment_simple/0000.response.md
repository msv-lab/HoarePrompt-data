Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the number of players who remain in the game after multiple rounds of elimination based on a specific sequence of positions (`a`). The game continues until no more players can be eliminated in a round.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function takes two parameters: `n` (initial number of players) and `p` (sequence of positions).
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly reduce `n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
   - The loop ensures that `n` is reduced to 0, effectively simulating the elimination process.
   - The function correctly returns 0, indicating that all players have been eliminated.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It then iterates over each `n` in `qs`, applies `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of remaining players, and appends the result to `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - The logic in `func_2` is consistent with the problem requirements and correctly processes each test case.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each case according to the problem's specifications.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented to accurately simulate the game's elimination process and produce the correct outputs.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution to the problem.
