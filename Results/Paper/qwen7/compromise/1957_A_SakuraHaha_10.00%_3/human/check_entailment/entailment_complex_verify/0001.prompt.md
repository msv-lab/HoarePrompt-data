You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the lengths of the sticks a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the sum of the counts of each integer in `a` divided by 4.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the counts of each integer in the list `a` divided by 4)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by `t` integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks in the current test case, and then `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the counts of each unique stick length divided by 4 and prints this sum for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` but immediately overwrites it with `1` and then reads the actual value of `t`. This is incorrect because the value of `t` should be used as is.
   
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - The program should loop through each test case using the correct value of `t`, but instead, it calls `func_1()` without properly handling multiple test cases.

3. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined correctly. It reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths, counts the occurrences of each length, and calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.

4. **Calculating Maximum Polygons**:
   - The function correctly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (since each polygon must have at least 3 sides).

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is correct.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has issues with handling multiple test cases and overwriting the value of `t`. However, once these issues are fixed, the logic within the function `func_1()` is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
