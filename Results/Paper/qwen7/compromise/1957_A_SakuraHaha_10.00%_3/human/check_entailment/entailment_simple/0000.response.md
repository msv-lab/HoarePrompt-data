### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Reading Test Case Details**: For each test case, it correctly reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a`. This is handled correctly.

3. **Counting Stick Lengths**: The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is done correctly.

4. **Calculating Maximum Polygons**: The program calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of each stick length by 4 (since each polygon has 4 sides). This logic is correct because each polygon requires 4 equal sides, and we need to find the maximum number of such sets of 4 sides that can be formed from the available sticks.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the correct number of polygons that can be formed.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
