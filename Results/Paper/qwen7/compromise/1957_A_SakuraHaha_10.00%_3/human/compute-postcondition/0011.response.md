Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by `t` integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks in the current test case, and then `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. It returns information based on these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a number of sticks with specified lengths, and returns specific information related to these inputs without explicitly accepting them as parameters within the function definition.
