The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, followed by `t` integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks in the current test case, and then `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the counts of each unique stick length divided by 4 and prints this sum for each test case.
