Output State: **`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the current clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2**.

This means that `mid` is calculated as half the difference between `big_element` and `small_element`, which simplifies to `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2`. All other variables retain their initial values.
