Reasoning:
1. The problem requires assigning distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex such that the graph formed by these assignments can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
2. The given program attempts to solve this by dividing the vertices into `cliques` where each clique is assigned a unique identifier.
3. The function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques needed as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes two lists: `arr` to store the values assigned to each vertex and `cliquess` to store the clique identifiers.
4. The function `make_array` is intended to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` lists according to the specified range and clique identifier.
5. However, the implementation of `make_array` is flawed. It does not correctly assign values to `arr` and `cliquess` based on the problem's requirements. Instead of ensuring that the values in `arr` are distinct and cover the range from 1 to n, the code incorrectly fills the arrays in a way that does not satisfy the conditions of the problem.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
