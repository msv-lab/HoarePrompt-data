### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1`: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2`: Converts the output of `func_1` to an integer.
   - `func_3`: Converts the output of `func_1` to a list of integers.
   - `func_4`: Implements the core logic of the program.

2. **Main Function Logic**:
   - `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction (`0` for clockwise, `1` for counterclockwise, and `?` for either), it updates the set `ans` with the possible new positions of the ball.
   - If the direction is `?`, both clockwise and counterclockwise positions are considered.
   - After processing all throws, it adjusts the set to ensure it only contains valid player numbers (i.e., between 1 and `n`).
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible players and their indices in sorted order.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the modulo operation to wrap around the circle.
   - It correctly discards position `0` and adds `n` when necessary.
   - The logic for handling `?` in the direction ensures all possible directions are considered.

4. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the number of possible players followed by their indices in sorted order.

5. **Detailed Analysis Using Annotations**:
   - The initial state before `func_4` is set up correctly with `t` (number of test cases), `n`, `m`, `x`, and the list of throws.
   - The loop iterates `m` times, updating the set `ans` based on the direction of each throw.
   - The conditional checks for `0` and `?` directions are handled correctly, ensuring all possible positions are considered.
   - The final adjustment of `ans` to remove `0` and add `n` if necessary ensures the set only contains valid player numbers.
   - The final print statements correctly output the number of possible players and their indices in sorted order.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution based on the problem statement. There are no logical errors or edge cases that the code fails to handle properly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
