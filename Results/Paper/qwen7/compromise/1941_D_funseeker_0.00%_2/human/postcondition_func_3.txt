The function accepts the number of players \( n \), the number of throws \( m \), the initial player with the ball \( x \), and a set \( ans \) initialized with \( x \). For each throw, it updates the set \( ans \) based on the direction specified ('0', '1', or '?'). After all throws, it removes the value 0 from \( ans \) if present and adds \( n \) to \( ans \). Finally, it prints the length of the updated set \( ans \) and the elements of \( ans \).
