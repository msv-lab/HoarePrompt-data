Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `q` and the iterable `ans`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the objects**:
   - `r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`.
   - `c` remains the same as its initial value.
   - `q` is the first element in `ans`.
   - `ans` now equals `temp`, and `temp` is an empty set.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `ans`. For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `q` is the first element in `ans`, the loop can start if `ans` is not empty.
   - `ans` is currently equal to `temp`, which is an empty set. Therefore, `ans` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `ans` is no longer an empty set but contains at least one element. The other variables (`r`, `c`) do not affect the loop's execution and remain unchanged.

**State after adjustment**:
- `r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`.
- `c` remains the same as its initial value.
- `q` is the first element in `ans`, and `ans` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the first element in `ans`, and `ans` must contain at least one element**.
