Output State: **All elements in `ans` have been processed, `r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, and `ans` now contains the results of adding and subtracting `r` modulo `n` for each element `q` in `temp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = temp` updates the list `ans` to be exactly the same as the list `temp`. Since `temp` contains the results of adding and subtracting `r` modulo `n` for each element `q` in `ans`, `ans` now holds these updated values. The variables `r`, `c`, and `temp` remain unchanged from their previous states.
