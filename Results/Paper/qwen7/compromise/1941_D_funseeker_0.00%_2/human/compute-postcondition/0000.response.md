Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`. The function `func_3()` has been called, and it has updated the values of `n`, `m`, and `x`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` have been updated by calling the function `func_3()`, but the exact values are not specified. The variable `ans` remains a set initialized with the player `x`.
