Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains `(q + r) % n`, and `temp` now also contains `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. Since `temp` initially contained `(q + r) % n`, after executing the code, `temp` will now include both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
