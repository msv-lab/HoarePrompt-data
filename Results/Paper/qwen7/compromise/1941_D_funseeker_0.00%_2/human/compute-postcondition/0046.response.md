Postcondition: `r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and if `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` has added `(q + r) % n` to itself.
