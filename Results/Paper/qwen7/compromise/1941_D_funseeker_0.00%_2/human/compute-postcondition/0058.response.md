Output State: **All elements in `ans` have been processed, `r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, and `temp` contains the results of adding and subtracting `r` modulo `n` for each element `q` in `ans`.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `r` retains its initial value obtained from `func_1()`, `c` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `temp` is a set containing the results of the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for every element `q` in the list `ans`. The loop processes each element in `ans` exactly once, performing the specified operations based on the value of `c`.
