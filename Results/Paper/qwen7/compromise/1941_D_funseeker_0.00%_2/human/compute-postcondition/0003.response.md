Output State: **`r` is the first element returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second element returned by `func_1().split()`**.

Explanation: The code `r, c = func_1().split()` splits the string returned by `func_1()` into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter and assigns the first part to `r` and the second part to `c`. Since the exact values of `r` and `c` depend on what `func_1()` returns, they are represented as the elements returned by `func_1().split()`. Other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
