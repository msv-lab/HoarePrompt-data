Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for q in ans`. This means the loop variable `q` is taken from the list `ans`.

2. **Understand the postconditions**:
   - `c` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `q` changes to the next element in `ans`.
   - If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the element `(q - r) % n`.
   - If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', `temp` remains unchanged with each element being `(q - r) % n`.

3. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**:
   - `c` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `q` will be the next element in `ans`.
   - `temp` will be updated based on the value of `c` and the new `q`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `q` changes to the next element in `ans`, the new value of `q` will be the next element in the list `ans`.
   - `c` remains the same.
   - `temp` will be updated based on the new `q` and the conditions specified.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

- `c` remains the same.
- `q` becomes the next element in `ans`.
- `temp` is updated based on the new `q` and the value of `c`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`c` remains the same, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` is updated based on the new `q` and the value of `c`**.
