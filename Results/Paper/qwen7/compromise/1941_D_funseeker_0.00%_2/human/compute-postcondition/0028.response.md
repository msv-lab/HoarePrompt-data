Output State: **`c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the last element in `ans`, and `ans` now equals `temp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = temp` assigns the value of the `temp` variable to the `ans` variable. This means that whatever elements were stored in `temp` are now stored in `ans`. The values of `c` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
