Output State: **`ans` contains at least one fewer element, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n` is unchanged**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` was previously containing `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, adding the same value again does not change the contents of `temp`. The other variables remain unchanged.
