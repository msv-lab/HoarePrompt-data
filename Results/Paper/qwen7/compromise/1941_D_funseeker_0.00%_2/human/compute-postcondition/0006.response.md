Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for q in ans:`. The only variable involved here is `q`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `q`**: Since `q` is iterating over the elements of `ans`, the initial value of `q` will be the first element of `ans`.

3. **Check the state of `ans`**: For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. If `ans` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `ans` contains at least one element. The other variables (`r`, `c`, and `temp`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the presence of elements in `ans`.

**State:**
**`ans` must contain at least one element**
