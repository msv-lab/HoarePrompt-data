Output State: **`r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the first element in `ans`, and `ans` now equals `temp`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r = int(r)` converts the string `r` into an integer. The other variables (`c`, `q`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
