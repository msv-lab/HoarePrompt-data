Output State: **`c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` contains elements where each element is `(q + r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds an element to the set `temp`. However, the values of `q`, `r`, and `n` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value added to `temp`. The only information we have is that `c` can be either '0' or '?', which remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged value of `c` and the updated state of `temp` with the new element added.
