Output State: **`c` remains the same, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the set `temp` by adding the value of `(q + r) % n`. The variables `c` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `temp` is now the set containing the computed value `(q + r) % n`.
