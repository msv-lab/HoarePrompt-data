Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for q in ans:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   The only variable in the loop head is `q`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `ans` that have not been processed.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`.
   - `c` remains the same as its initial value.
   - `q` is the next element in `ans`.
   - `ans` must contain at least one element.
   - `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
   - If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` has added either `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` to itself.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `q` is the variable in the loop head, it needs to be updated to the next element in `ans`.
   - `ans` should be updated to remove the current `q` (since it has been processed).
   - `r` remains unchanged.
   - `c` remains unchanged.
   - `temp` will be updated based on the new `q` value, but since the exact operations are not specified, we can assume it will follow the same pattern as described.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `r` remains the same.
   - `c` remains the same.
   - `q` becomes the next element in `ans`.
   - `ans` now contains all elements except the current `q`.
   - `temp` will be updated based on the new `q` value, but the exact values depend on the loop body, so we can't specify them precisely without the loop body.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`r` is an integer value of the first part of the split result from `func_1()`, `c` remains the same as its initial value, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` will be updated based on the new `q` value.**
