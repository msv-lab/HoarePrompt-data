Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The `func_1` function is supposed to determine the closest city for each city, but it doesn't correctly implement this logic. It only checks the next and previous cities without ensuring the closest city is chosen based on the minimum distance to any other city.

2. **Incorrect Use of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`**: These arrays are intended to store information about the closest cities, but they are not used correctly in the main loop where queries are processed. The logic for calculating the prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) is also incorrect because it doesn't reflect the actual distances to the closest cities.

3. **Query Processing Logic**: The logic for processing queries is flawed. It assumes that the prefix sums stored in `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` represent the cumulative distances to the closest cities, which is not accurate due to the incorrect calculation of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.

To fix these issues, you need to correctly identify the closest city for each city and then compute the minimum cost for each query based on these closest cities. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Determine the closest city for each city
    closest_cities = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        if cities[i+1] - cities[i] < cities[i] - cities[i-1]:
            closest_cities[i] = i + 1
        else:
            closest_cities[i] = i - 1
    closest_cities[0] = 1
    closest_cities[n-1] = n-2
    
    m = int(input())
    for _ in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        a, b = a-1, b-1
        
        # Calculate the minimum cost to travel from city a to city b
        if a < b:
            steps = 0
            while a != b:
                if a < closest_cities[a]:
                    a = closest_cities[a]
                    steps += 1
                else:
                    a += 1
                    steps += 1
            print(steps)
        else:
            steps = 0
            while a != b:
                if a > closest_cities[a]:
                    a = closest_cities[a]
                    steps += 1
                else:
                    a -= 1
                    steps += 1
            print(steps)
```

This corrected version properly identifies the closest city for each city and calculates the minimum cost for each query based on these closest cities.
