Output State: **`i` is 0, `back` is -99999999999999999999, and `forward` is the value of `cities[1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `forward` to be the value of `cities[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 0 (from the initial state), `forward` is now set to `cities[1]`. The other variables (`i` and `back`) remain unchanged.
