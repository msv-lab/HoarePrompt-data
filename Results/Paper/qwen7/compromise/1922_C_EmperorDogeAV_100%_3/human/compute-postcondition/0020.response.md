Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `back` is -99999999999999999999
   - `forward` is the value of `cities[1]`
   - The postcondition is that if `abs(forward - cities[i])` is less than `abs(cities[i] - back)`, then `prog_cities[0]` is 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[0]` is the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[0]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1):`

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be within the range `range(n - 1)`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - `back` remains unchanged because it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `forward` remains the value of `cities[1]` because it is not modified inside the loop.

6. **New Values:**
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `back` remains -99999999999999999999.
   - `forward` remains the value of `cities[1]`.

7. **Postcondition Adjustment:**
   - The postcondition will be evaluated again with the new value of `i` (which is now 1).
   - The postcondition checks if `abs(forward - cities[i])` is less than `abs(cities[i] - back)`.
   - If true, `prog_cities[0]` will be 1.
   - If false, `prog_cities[0]` will be the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[0]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `back` is -99999999999999999999, `forward` is the value of `cities[1]`**.
