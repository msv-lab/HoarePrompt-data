Output State: **`back` is either `cities[i - 1]` if `i > 0`, or remains `-99999999999999999999`. `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`, or remains `999999999999999999` if `i >= n - 1`. `prog_cities[1]` remains `|cities[2] - cities[1]|`. `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1`.**

This means that the value of `prog_cities[i]` has been updated to `1`, while the values of `back`, `forward`, and `prog_cities[1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
