Output State: **`left` is a list containing 0.**

The initial state defines that `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` represents the size of the i-th slime. However, the provided code snippet only initializes the list `left` with a single element, which is `0`. No changes are made to the list `a` or any other variables. Therefore, the only change is that `left` is now a list containing the single element `0`.
