Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans[1]` is 1, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx` is the return value of `func_1(left, x)`**.

Explanation: The line `inx = func_1(left, x)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `left` and `x`, and assigns the return value of this function call to the variable `inx`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, `inx` will hold whatever value `func_1` returns. The values of `i`, `ans[1]`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
