Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the last element of the list at index `i - 1`, `ans[i]` is `i + 1 - inx`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans[i]` becomes `3 + 1 - inx`, which simplifies to `4 - inx`. The other variables (`n`, `x`, and `inx`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
