Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `last` is a list.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` contains the value of `i` after it was incremented.
   - Otherwise, `last` is a list with one additional element which is the same as the last element of the original list.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `last` is a list.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer and does not change within the loop.
   - The condition for `last` is based on the comparison `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. However, since we are only adjusting the states for the loop to execute one more time, we don't need to consider the exact contents of `last` unless explicitly required by the loop logic.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `last` is still a list but its exact contents depend on the loop body, which we are not modifying.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `last` is a list.**
