Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans[i]` is 1; `n` is the length of the original list `a`; the current value of `a[i]` is less than the previous value `a[i - 1]`**.

This means that the variable `ans[i]` has been assigned the value 1, where `i` is 1. All other conditions remain the same as the initial state.
