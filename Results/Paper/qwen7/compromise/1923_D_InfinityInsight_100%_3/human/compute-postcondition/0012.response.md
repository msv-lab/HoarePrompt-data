Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `last` is a list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Analyze the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `i` is appended to `last`. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` has its last element appended with itself.

5. **Determine the new state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not indicated here.
   - `last` may or may not change depending on the values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, but this does not affect the loop condition directly.

Given the above analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` remains the same, we update `i` to `i + 1`.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously some value `k`, now `i` is `k + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, let's denote it as `k`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`i` is k + 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `last` is a list**.

However, since the exact value of `i` is not given, we can generalize the answer as follows:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `last` is a list**.

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `last` is a list**.
