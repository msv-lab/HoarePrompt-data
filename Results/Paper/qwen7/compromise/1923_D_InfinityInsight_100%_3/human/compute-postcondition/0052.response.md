Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` must be greater than 2; `ans[3]` is 1**

The code `ans[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the element of the list `ans` at index `i`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans[3]` is now 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
