Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `x` is left[3] - a[3] - 1, and if a[3] is less than a[2], the value of ans[3] remains 1. If a[3] is not less than a[2], the value of ans[3] remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `left[i] - a[i] - 1` to `x`. Since `i` is 3, `x` becomes `left[3] - a[3] - 1`. The conditions related to `ans[3]` remain unchanged because the code does not affect `a[2]`, `a[3]`, or `ans[3]`. Therefore, the postconditions for `ans[3]` stay the same.
