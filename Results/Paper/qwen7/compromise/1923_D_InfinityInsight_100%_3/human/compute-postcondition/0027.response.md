Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, meaning `i` has taken the first element from the list `a`.

3. **Update the State**: Since `i` has taken the first element, the list `a` now has one less element than it did before. Therefore, `a` must now be a list with one fewer element than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: For the loop to execute again, `i` will take the next element from the updated list `a`. Since `i` was 1 (the first element), the next value of `i` will be the second element of the updated list `a`.

5. **Adjust the States**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `a`. `i` will be the second element of the updated list `a`, and `a` will be a list with one fewer element than it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is the second element of the list `a`, `a` is a non-empty list with one fewer element than it had at the end of the previous iteration, `last` is an appropriately initialized list, `left` is a list with its last element updated to `left[-1] + 1`**.
