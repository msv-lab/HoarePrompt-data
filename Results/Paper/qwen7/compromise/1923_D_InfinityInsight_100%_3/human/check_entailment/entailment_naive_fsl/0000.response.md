Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten. Specifically, the program uses `func_1` and `func_2` to attempt to solve the problem, but these functions do not accurately reflect the rules described in the problem statement.

The core issue lies in how the program handles the conditions under which a slime can eat another slime. According to the problem description, a slime can only eat a neighbor if it is strictly larger than that neighbor. However, the program does not properly account for this condition in `func_2`.

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
2 2 3 1 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
2 1 -1 1 2
```
However, the program will incorrectly compute the results because it does not correctly handle the condition where a slime cannot eat a smaller or equal-sized neighbor.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown of the issue:
- In the example, the third slime (size 3) can eat the second slime (size 2) in 1 second, but the program might not correctly compute this.
- Similarly, the fifth slime (size 1) cannot eat the fourth slime (size 1) because they are of equal size, but the program might incorrectly compute that the fifth slime can eat the fourth slime.

Thus, the program fails to correctly simulate the process of slimes eating each other according to the given rules, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
