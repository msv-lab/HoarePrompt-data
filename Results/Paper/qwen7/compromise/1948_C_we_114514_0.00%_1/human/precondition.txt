t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is an even integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The function takes a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple containing an integer n and two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid respectively, with each string consisting of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>' indicating the direction of the arrow in each cell.
