Output State: **reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False, n is test_case[0], row1 is test_case[1][0], and row2 is test_case[1][1]**.

The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `False`. This does not affect the values of `reachable_first_row`, `n`, `row1`, and `row2`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
