Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` and the condition `range(n)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `reachable_first_row` is True or False.
   - `reachable_second_row` is True.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is equal to `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently `n - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `n`.
   - The condition for the loop to execute is `j < n`, so if `j` becomes `n`, the loop will stop.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `reachable_first_row` remains the same (True or False).
   - `reachable_second_row` remains True.
   - `n` remains the same (must be greater than 0).
   - `j` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `n`.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`reachable_first_row` is True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is equal to `n`**.
