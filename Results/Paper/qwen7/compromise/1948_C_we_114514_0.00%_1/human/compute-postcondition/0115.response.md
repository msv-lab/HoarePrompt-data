Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in this case is `j`, and the other relevant variables are `n`, `reachable_first_row`, and `reachable_second_row`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the New Value of `j`**: For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `n`.

4. **Check the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - `reachable_second_row` must remain the same unless it changes within the loop body.
   - `reachable_first_row` can change based on the conditions given.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - The new value of `j` will be `n`.

5. **Consider the Conditions for `reachable_second_row`**:
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it will remain `True` unless the loop body changes it.
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, it will remain `False`.

6. **Consider the Conditions for `reachable_first_row`**:
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `row2[j] == '>'`, `reachable_first_row` remains `True`.
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `reachable_first_row` remains `False`.
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True` and `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, `reachable_first_row` remains `True`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `j` will be incremented to `n`.
- `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`reachable_first_row` is True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is equal to `n`**.
