Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < n`. For the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `reachable_second_row` remains `True`.
   - `reachable_first_row` remains `True` if `row1[j] == '>'`, otherwise it is `False`.
   - `j` remains unchanged if it is not decreased due to `row2[j] == '>'`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `j < n`, we need to increment `j` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` will remain as they are unless the loop body changes them, but since no such change is mentioned, they stay the same.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `reachable_second_row` remains `True`.
   - `reachable_first_row` remains `True` if `row1[j+1] == '>'`, otherwise it is `False`.
   - `j` becomes `j + 1`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`reachable_second_row` remains `True`, `reachable_first_row` remains `True` if `row1[j+1] == '>'`, otherwise it is `False`, and `j` is `j + 1`**.
