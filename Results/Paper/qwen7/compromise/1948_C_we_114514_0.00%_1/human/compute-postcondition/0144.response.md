Output State: **reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is True, n must be greater than 0, j is n - 1, and the value of row1[j] is '>'**.

The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`, which changes its state from `False`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
