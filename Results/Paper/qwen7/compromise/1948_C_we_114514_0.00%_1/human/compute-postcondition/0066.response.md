Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `test_case`. This means the only variable that can be adjusted is `test_case`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are more elements in `test_cases` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `reachable_first_row` is a boolean indicating whether every character in `row1` from index 0 to `n-2` is not '>', and the last character (`row1[n-1]`) is '>'.
   - `reachable_second_row` remains `True`.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.
   - `results` list contains 'YES' if `reachable_first_row` is `True`, otherwise it contains 'NO'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `test_case` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `test_case` is set to the next element in `test_cases`.
   - If `test_cases` still has elements, the loop will continue.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted such that `test_case` is set to the next element in `test_cases`.

**State:**
**`reachable_first_row` is True if every character in `row1` from index 0 to `n-2` is not '>', and the last character (`row1[n-1]`) is '>', otherwise it is False; `reachable_second_row` remains True; the value of `j` is `n - 1`; `results` list contains 'YES' if `reachable_first_row` is True, otherwise it contains 'NO'; `test_case` is the next element in `test_cases`**.
