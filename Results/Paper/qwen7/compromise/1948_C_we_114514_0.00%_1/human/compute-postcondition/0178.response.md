Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are boolean values. If `row2[j] == '>'`, then `reachable_first_row` becomes False, `reachable_second_row` becomes True, and if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>',` the condition holds true. If `row2[j] != '>'`, the conditions remain as `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are both True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is `n`.
