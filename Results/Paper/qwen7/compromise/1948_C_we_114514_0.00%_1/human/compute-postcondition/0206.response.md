Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether `reachable_second_row` becomes True for that test case. If `reachable_second_row` becomes True for any test case, the corresponding entry in `results` will be 'YES', otherwise it will be 'NO'. 

The values of `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, `n`, and `j` will remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop. Since the loop processes each test case sequentially, the final state of these variables will reflect the outcome of the last test case processed.
