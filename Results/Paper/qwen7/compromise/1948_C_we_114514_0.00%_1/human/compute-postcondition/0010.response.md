Output State: **reachable_second_row is True, `reachable_first_row` is true, the current value of `row1[j]` is '>', and j equals n - 1.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `True` to the variable `reachable_second_row`. This does not affect the values of `reachable_first_row`, `row1[j]`, or `j`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
