Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `n`. Therefore, the only variables that need to be considered for adjustment are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**: According to the given state before the loop starts, `j` is equal to `n - 1` and `n` is equal to `n`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Given that `j` is initially set to `n - 1`, the loop will execute exactly once if `n > 0`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: Since the loop will execute once if `n > 0`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The value of `j` will be decremented by 1 during the loop execution, so after the loop, `j` will be `n - 2`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0 and `j` must be `n - 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n - 1`**
