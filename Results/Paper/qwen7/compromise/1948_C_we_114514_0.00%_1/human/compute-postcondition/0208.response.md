Output State: **The program returns a list called `results` that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. Each entry in the list indicates whether `reachable_second_row` became True for that specific test case. The length of the list is equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`. For the last test case, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` reflect the final state, `n` is the `n` value of the last test case, and `j` is `n - 1`.**

This means the program returns a list where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether `reachable_second_row` was True for each test case. The list's length matches the number of test cases. Additionally, for the last test case processed, the values of `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, `n`, and `j` are provided.
