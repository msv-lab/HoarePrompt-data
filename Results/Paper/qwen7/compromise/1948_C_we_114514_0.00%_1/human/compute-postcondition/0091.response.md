Output State: **reachable_first_row is True or False, reachable_second_row is True, n must be greater than 0, j is equal to n - 1, (row2[j] == '>') is true.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `reachable_first_row`, `n`, `j`, or the condition `(row2[j] == '>')`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values from the initial state.
