Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are boolean values. If `reachable_second_row` is true, then `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are true, and `j` equals `n - 1`. If `reachable_second_row` is false, then `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and `j` is less than `n - 1`.
