Output State: **reachable_first_row is True or False, reachable_second_row is False, n is greater than 0, j is equal to n - 1, results is ['NO']**

The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending 'NO', it becomes `['NO']`. The values of `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
