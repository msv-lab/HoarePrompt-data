Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, the first row of arrows, and the second row of arrows.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The function `func_1` iterates through each column of the grid to simulate the robot's movement. It maintains two flags: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track whether the robot can reach the second row from the first row and whether it can stay in the second row until the end.

3. **Movement Simulation**:
   - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points right (`>`), it checks if it can move to the next column.
   - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points left (`<`), it sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` because the robot cannot move further in the first row.
   - If the robot reaches the last column in the first row (`j == n - 1`) and it can move to the second row, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

4. **Final Check**: After simulating the movement for all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it means the robot can reach the cell (2, n), and the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the provided solution correctly handles all scenarios and produces the expected output.
