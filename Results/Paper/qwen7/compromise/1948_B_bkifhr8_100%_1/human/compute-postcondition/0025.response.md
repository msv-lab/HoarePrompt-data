Postcondition: `ans` remains `False`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is `m - 2`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be equal to the integer value of the element at index `i` in `arr` concatenated with the element at index `i - 1` in `arr`.
