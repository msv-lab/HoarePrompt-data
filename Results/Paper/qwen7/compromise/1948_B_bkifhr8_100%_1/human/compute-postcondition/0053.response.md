Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is False, `arr[1]` is `nums[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the element at index `i - 1` in the list `arr` to be the first element of the list `nums`. Given that `i` is 2, the index `i - 1` is 1. Therefore, `arr[1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`. The values of `m` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
