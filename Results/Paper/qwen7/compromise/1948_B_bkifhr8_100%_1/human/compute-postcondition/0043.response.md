Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially set to 2.

3. **Determine the Range of the For Loop**: The loop runs from `m - 1` to `0` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means the loop will run as long as `m - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `m - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0. This implies that `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.

5. **Consider Other Given States**: The other given states (`ans`, `n`, `m`, `arr`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are related to `i` and `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**
