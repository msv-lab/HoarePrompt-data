Postcondition: **`ans` remains `False`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is `m - 3`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be equal to the integer value of the last element of `arr` (before index adjustment) concatenated with the element at index `i` in `arr`, `nums` is a list containing the integer value of the last element of `arr` (before index adjustment) concatenated with the element at index `i` in `arr`, and if `nums` is not sorted, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
