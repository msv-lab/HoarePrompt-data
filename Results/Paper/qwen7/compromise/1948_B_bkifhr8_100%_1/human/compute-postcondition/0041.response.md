Output State: **`ans` is `True`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `m` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The line `ans = True` sets the variable `ans` to `True`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
