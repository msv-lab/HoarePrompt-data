Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` remains False, `arr[1]` is `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet converts the digit at `arr[i-1]` (which is `arr[0]` since `i` is 1) into a list of its digits and appends `arr[i]` (which is `arr[1]`) to this list. So, `nums` becomes a list of these digits. All other variables remain unchanged.
