Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `m`, or `ans`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code snippet provided, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
