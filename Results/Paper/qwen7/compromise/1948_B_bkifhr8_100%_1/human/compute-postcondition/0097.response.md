Postcondition: `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is set to `False`, and `i` is now `i - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `nums` is not sorted. If `nums` is sorted, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.
