Postcondition: `ans` is `False`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is `m - 1`, and if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then the condition `ans` is set to `False`. If the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is not met, `ans` remains `False`.
