Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans` remains False, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by the element `arr[1]`.**

Explanation: 
- The initial state had `i` as 0, `m` as greater than or equal to 1, `ans` as False, and `arr[1]` as the first element of `nums`.
- The code snippet converts `arr[i - 1]` (which is `arr[0]` since `i` is 0) into a list of its digits using `str(arr[i - 1])` and then converts each character to an integer using `int()`. This list is then concatenated with `[arr[i]]` (which is `arr[1]`).
- After executing the code, `nums` will be a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by the element `arr[1]`. The values of `i`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
