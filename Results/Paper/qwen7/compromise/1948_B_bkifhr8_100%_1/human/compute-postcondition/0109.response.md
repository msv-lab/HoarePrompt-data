Postcondition: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` converted to a string and then to integers, `ans` is set to `False`, and `i` is now `i + 1`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the if part.**
