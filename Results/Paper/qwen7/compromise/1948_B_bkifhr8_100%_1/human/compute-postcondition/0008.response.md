Output State: **`ans` is `True`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the integer value of the last element of `arr` followed by the current value of `arr[i]`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a new list `nums` by converting the last element of `arr` (which is `arr[i - 1]`) into an integer and appending the current value of `arr[i]` to it.
- Since `arr[i]` was already less than `arr[i - 1]`, the new list `nums` will contain two consecutive elements from `arr` where the first is less than the second.
- All other variables (`ans`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
