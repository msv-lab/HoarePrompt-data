Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `m` and the array itself.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted initially.
   
3. **Checking Array Order:**
   - It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning (`m - 1` to `0`).
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`.

4. **Digit Splitting and Sorting Check:**
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, it splits `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted.
   - If the list of digits is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints "NO" if `ans` is `False`, otherwise it prints "YES".

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Digit Splitting and Sorting Check:**
   - The logic for checking if the digits of `arr[i - 1]` plus `arr[i]` can be sorted is flawed.
   - The program only checks if the combined list of digits is sorted but does not ensure that the resulting array can be sorted after splitting and reinserting the digits.

2. **Assumption of Splitting and Reinsertion:**
   - The program assumes that splitting and reinserting the digits will always result in a sorted array, which is not necessarily true. For example, consider the array `[12, 34, 56]`. Splitting `12` and `34` and reinserting them might not result in a sorted array.

3. **No Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array cannot be sorted even after splitting and reinserting digits.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
