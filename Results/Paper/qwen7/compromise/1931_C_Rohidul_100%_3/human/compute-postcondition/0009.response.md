Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `l` is 1
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - `le` is the length of list `a`
   - `st` is 2
   - `end` is 1

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `l` is 1
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - `a[l]` is `a[1]`
   - `a[l + 1]` is `a[2]`

5. **Determine what needs to change**:
   - For `l < r` to be true, `l` should be less than `r`. Since `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`, this condition is already satisfied as long as `n > 2`.
   - For `a[l] == a[l + 1]` to be true, `a[1]` should be equal to `a[2]`.

6. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `a[1] == a[2]` for the loop to continue. This means the elements at indices 1 and 2 in the list `a` must be equal.
   - We do not need to adjust `l` or `r` because they are already set up to satisfy the loop condition as long as the elements at indices 1 and 2 are equal.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the elements in the list `a` such that `a[1] == a[2]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1**
