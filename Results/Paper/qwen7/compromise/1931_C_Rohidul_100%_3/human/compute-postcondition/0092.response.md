Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is the original value of `n - 3`, `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is the total number of iterations executed, `end` is 3, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` must equal `a[-1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `end` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
