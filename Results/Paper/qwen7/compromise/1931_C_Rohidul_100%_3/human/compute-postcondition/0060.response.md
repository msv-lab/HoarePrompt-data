Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` must be decreased to allow `r > l`, `r` is now `n - 7`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1] == a[2]` and `a[2] == a[3]` and so on until `a[n-5] == a[n-4]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is -2, `end` is 4, `ans` is -1**

Explanation: The line `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. Initially, `end` was 3, so after executing this line, `end` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
