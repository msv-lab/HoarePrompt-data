Postcondition: `total` is 0, `l` is `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `a` is a list of integers, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is 1, `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)`. If the first and last elements of list `a` are equal, `ans` is updated to `le - (n - 1 + 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains as `le - max(n - 1, 1)`.
