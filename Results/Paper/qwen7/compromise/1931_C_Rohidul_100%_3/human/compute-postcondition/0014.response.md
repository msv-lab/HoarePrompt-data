Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[2] == a[3]`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 4, `end` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 3.**

The value of `st` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
