Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `l` is 1
   - `r` is n - 1
   - `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one
   - `le` is the length of list `a`
   - `st` is 2
   - `end` is 1
   - `ans` is 0
   - `a[0]` must equal `a[1]`

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop head contains two conditions: `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true.
   - The current values are `l = 1` and `r = n - 1`. Since `l < r` is true (assuming `n > 2`), the first part of the condition is satisfied.
   - The second part of the condition is `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. Given that `a[0]` must equal `a[1]` and `a` is such that each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one, `a[1] == a[2]` must hold true.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can continue, which means `l` should be incremented by 1 and checked against `r`.
   - Therefore, we need to set `l` to `2` and keep `r` as `n - 1`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `r`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 2, `r` is n - 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` must equal `a[1]`**
