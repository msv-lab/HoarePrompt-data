Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 0.
- `l` is `n - 1`.
- `r` is `n - 2`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `le` is the length of list `a`.
- `st` is `n - 1`.
- `end` is 1.
- `ans` is `le - (n - 1 + 1)` unless the first and last elements of list `a` are equal, in which case it remains `le - (n - 1 + 1)`.

Given this, the value of `ans` is determined solely by the formula `le - (n - 1 + 1)`, because there's no information provided about the first and last elements of the list `a` being equal or not. Therefore, `ans` is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{ans} = \text{le} - (n - 1 + 1) = \text{le} - n \]

Since `le` is the length of the list `a`, and the length of a list is always a positive integer, the exact value of `le` is not specified, but the formula for `ans` is clear.

Output: **le - n (where le is the length of list a and n is the length of list a plus one)**
