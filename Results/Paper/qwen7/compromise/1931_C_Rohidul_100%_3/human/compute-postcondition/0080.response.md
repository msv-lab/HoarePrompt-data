Output State: **`total` is 0, `l` is 3, `r` is n - 1, `a` is a list of integers where each element from index 1 to n-4 is equal to the next one, `le` is the length of list `a`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1, `ans` is 0, and `a[0]` must equal `a[1]`**.

Explanation: The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
