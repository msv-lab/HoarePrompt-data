Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - The value of `i` is determined by the expression `int(input())`, which means `i` will take the value of the input provided by the user.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = t-1`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means that the input provided by the user (which determines `i`) should be within the range defined by `t`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that the input provided by the user is valid, i.e., it should be an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\).
   - Since `t` is already defined and within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that the input matches this range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input provided by the user, ensuring it is within the valid range.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input provided by the user must be an integer within the range 0 ≤ input < t**
