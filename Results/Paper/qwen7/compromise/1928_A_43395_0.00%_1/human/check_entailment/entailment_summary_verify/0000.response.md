### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the problem statement to determine its correctness.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - Bob needs to cut a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) into two smaller rectangles and then use those to form a new rectangle.
   - The new rectangle must be different from the original one, considering rotations as identical.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases.
   - It checks specific conditions involving \(a\) and \(b\).
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, it prints 'yes'.
   - If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) equals \(-a\) or \(-b\), it prints 'no'.
   - If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, it prints 'yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

3. **Original Assessment Analysis**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out several issues:
     - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` is insufficient because a 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles and rearranged to form a 2x2 rectangle again.
     - The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect because it doesn't cover all valid cases where a new rectangle can be formed.
     - The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is redundant and incorrect.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly determine if a new rectangle can be formed, we need to check if either dimension is 1 or if the dimensions can be split such that the resulting pieces can form a new rectangle.
   - For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which should return 'yes'.

5. **Program Evaluation**:
   - The current program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
   - The conditions provided do not cover all valid scenarios where a new rectangle can be formed.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
