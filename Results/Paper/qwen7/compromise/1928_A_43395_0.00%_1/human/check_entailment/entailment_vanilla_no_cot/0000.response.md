Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Conditions for Printing 'yes' and 'no':**
   - The conditions `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` and `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` are incorrect and do not cover all necessary cases.
   - The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is also incorrect and redundant.

2. **Logic for Determining if Another Rectangle Can Be Formed:**
   - The key to solving this problem is to check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, because if at least one dimension is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - If both dimensions are odd, no such transformation is possible.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This version checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise prints 'No'. This logic correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle.
