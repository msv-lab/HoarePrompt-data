### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the given program. Let's break down the problems and verify the solution step-by-step.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**:
   - The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the problem. It should check if `a == b` instead, indicating that the rectangle is a square and cannot be cut into two non-trivial rectangles.

2. **Redundant and Incorrect Condition**:
   - The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is redundant and incorrect. It checks if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, but it doesn't provide a clear logic for determining if a new rectangle can be formed.

3. **Missing Conditions**:
   - The program should handle the case where one dimension is exactly twice the other (i.e., `a == 2 * b` or `b == 2 * a`). This is a valid way to form a new rectangle.

#### Correct Conditions:
- A rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and rearranged to form a new rectangle if at least one of the following conditions is met:
  - Both dimensions are even.
  - One dimension is exactly twice the other (i.e., `a == 2 * b` or `b == 2 * a`).

#### Revised Program:
Here is a revised version of the program that correctly implements the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('no')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')

func()
```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Reading Dimensions**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
   - This part is also correct and matches the problem description.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if a == b`
     - If `a` and `b` are equal, the rectangle is a square and cannot be cut into two non-trivial rectangles. Hence, it prints 'no'.
   - **Condition 2**: `elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`
     - If both dimensions are even, the program prints 'yes' because you can always cut them into smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - **Condition 3**: `elif a == 2 * b or b == 2 * a`
     - If one dimension is exactly twice the other, the program prints 'yes' because you can cut the larger dimension into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - **Else**: `print('no')`
     - This covers all other cases, ensuring that the program handles all edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The revised program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given dimensions. The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the original program and the need for a corrected approach.

**Final: True**
