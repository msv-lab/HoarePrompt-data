### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### 1. Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading pairs of integers \(a\) and \(b\).

#### 2. Conditions Analysis:
- **Condition 1:** `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:`
  - This condition checks if both dimensions are even. If true, it prints 'yes'. However, this is not always correct. For example, a 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles and rearranged to form a 2x2 rectangle again, which is not a new rectangle. Hence, this condition is too restrictive and incorrect.

- **Condition 2:** `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`
  - This condition checks if the difference between the dimensions is equal to one of the dimensions. If true, it prints 'no'. This condition is also incorrect. For instance, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is a valid case that should return 'yes'.

- **Condition 3:** `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`
  - This condition checks if the difference between the dimensions is odd. It is redundant and incorrect because it does not cover all valid cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

- **Else Condition:** `else: print('no')`
  - This condition handles all other cases by printing 'no'. This is overly broad and does not cover many valid scenarios.

#### 3. Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle, we need to consider the following:
- If either dimension is 1, the rectangle cannot be cut into smaller rectangles.
- If both dimensions are even, the rectangle can be cut into smaller rectangles and rearranged to form a new rectangle.
- If the dimensions can be split such that the resulting pieces can form a new rectangle, it should return 'yes'.

Based on the problem description and the example cases, the correct logic should be:
- Check if either dimension is 1.
- Check if both dimensions are even.
- Check if the dimensions can be split to form a new rectangle.

#### 4. Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. The conditions provided in the original program are incomplete and incorrect. The corrected program above addresses these issues and correctly determines if Bob can obtain another rectangle.

**Final: False**
