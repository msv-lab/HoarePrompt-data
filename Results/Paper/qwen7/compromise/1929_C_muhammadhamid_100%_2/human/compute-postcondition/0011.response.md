Based on the initial state and the operations described:

1. `k` is an integer entered by the user.
2. `x` must be greater than 2.
3. `a` is an integer entered by the user.
4. `i` is set to 3.
5. `s` is initially set to 5.

The loop does not affect `i` and `s` directly since `i` is set to 3 and `s` starts at 5. The value of `s` is updated inside the loop with the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. However, the loop's execution is determined by `x`, and it is stated that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `x-1`.

Given that `i` ends up being `x-1`, the loop runs `x-3` times (since `i` starts at 3 and increments by 1 each time). Each iteration of the loop increases `s` by at least 1, but the exact value of `s` depends on the value of `k`. Since `s` starts at 5 and increases by at least 1 for each iteration, the final value of `s` will be `5 + (x-3) = x + 2`.

Therefore, `s` will be `x + 2` after the loop completes.

The print statement checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` (which is `x + 2`). If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Output: **Yes** if `a >= x + 2` else **No**
