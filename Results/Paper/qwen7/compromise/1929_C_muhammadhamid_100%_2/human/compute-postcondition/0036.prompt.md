Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    s = 1
    for i in range(x):
        s += s // (k - 1) + 1
    print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` must be greater than 2, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 3, `s` is 5.

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is determined by the value of `x`), the variable `i` will be equal to `x-1` and the variable `s` will be calculated based on the initial value and the operations performed within the loop. Given the operations `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`, starting from `s = 1`, after each iteration, `s` increases by at least 1, leading to the final value of `s` being `x + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`. After all iterations, `k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is `x + 2`, and `s` is the sum of its initial value plus the result of adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `k` and `x` retain their final values as determined by the loop's conditions, `i` is set to `x + 2` (as it was incremented outside the loop), and `s` has been updated through the loop to include the sum of `s // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 0 to `x - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `k` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer entered by the user, `a` is an integer entered by the user, `i` is 3, `s` is 3 + 3 // (k - 1) + 1.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 3 because the loop runs from 0 to `x-1`, and `x` was set to 3 based on the previous outputs. The variable `s` will be updated according to the loop's operation: it starts at 1, then for each iteration, `s` is incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1`. After 3 iterations, `s` becomes `3 + 3 // (k - 1) + 1`. All other variables (`k`, `x`, `a`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
