Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the betting strategy needed to ensure Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n`. The logic in the loop where `s` is updated is flawed. Specifically, the formula used to update `s` does not accurately represent the possible outcomes of the bets according to the problem statement.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses the maximum allowed number of times consecutively (`x` times). After those losses, Sasha should be able to recover and continue betting to eventually reach any desired number of coins `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of coins required to guarantee winning after x consecutive losses
        min_coins_needed = (k ** x - 1) // (k - 1)
        
        # Check if Sasha can start with 'a' coins and still have enough to recover after x consecutive losses
        if a >= min_coins_needed:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Calculate Minimum Coins Needed**: The expression `(k ** x - 1) // (k - 1)` calculates the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to have after losing `x` times in a row. This is derived from the geometric series sum formula.
2. **Check Initial Coins**: Compare Sasha's initial coins `a` with the minimum coins needed. If `a` is greater than or equal to `min_coins_needed`, Sasha can guarantee winning after the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row.
3. **Output Result**: Print 'YES' if Sasha can achieve the goal, otherwise print 'NO'.

This approach ensures that the solution correctly handles all test cases as per the problem statement.
