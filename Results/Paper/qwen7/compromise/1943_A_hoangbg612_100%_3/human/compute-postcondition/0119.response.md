Output State: **The dictionary M is empty, the list cnt contains all keys from the original dictionary M where the value was 1, and the length of cnt is greater than or equal to 2; cur is equal to the second element in the list cnt.**

Explanation: The code assigns the second element of the list `cnt` to the variable `cur`. Since `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, and its length is at least 2, `cur` is now set to the second key in `cnt`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
