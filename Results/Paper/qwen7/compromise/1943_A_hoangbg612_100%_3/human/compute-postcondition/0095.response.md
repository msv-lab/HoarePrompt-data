Output State: **`N` is a list containing all elements except the one that was just processed (which is `num`), `cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `num` is less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N`.**

Explanation: The code sets `cur` to be equal to `num`. All other conditions and states remain unchanged from the initial state.
