Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is empty, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is -1, and `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `cur` to `-1`. This directly updates the value of `cur` without affecting any other variables or conditions. The initial states of `T`, `M`, `cnt`, and `N` remain unchanged.
