Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` contains all the keys from the dictionary `M` that satisfied the condition `M[k] == 1` during the loop's execution (which is now an empty set since `M` is empty), the length of the list `cnt` is 0, and `cur` is equal to -1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `N` is a non-empty list, `cur` is equal to `num`, and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `num` is less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `N` is a non-empty list, `cur` is the next element in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, and if `num` (the next element in `N`) is greater than `cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `num` is less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `N` is a list containing all elements except the one that was just processed (which is `num`), `cur` is either equal to `num` or the next element in the updated list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. The most internal loop or if statement is not broken if `num > cur + 1`, otherwise, it continues based on the value of `cur`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
