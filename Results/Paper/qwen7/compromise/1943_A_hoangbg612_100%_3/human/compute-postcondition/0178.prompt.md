Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `N` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears consecutively in `N`, `cnt` is an empty list, `cur` is the last integer processed in the list `N`, and `N` is an empty list since all elements have been processed. Additionally, if the sum of all values in the dictionary `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is incremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `cnt` is a list containing the key `k`, `cur` is the last integer processed in the list `N`, and `N` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `cnt` is a list containing the next key `k` appended, and `cur` is the last integer processed in the list `N`, which remains empty since all elements have been processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key remaining, `cnt` is a list containing the next key `k` appended, `cur` is the last integer processed in the list `N`. If `M[k]` equals 1, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
