Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will have the following characteristics:

- `cur` will be the highest value in the list `N` that satisfies the condition `num > cur - 1`.
- The dictionary `M` will have entries where the key is the value of `cur` at the point when it was last updated (either directly by setting `cur = num` or incremented by 1). For each key, the value will be the count of numbers in `N` that are either equal to the key or fall within the range `[cur - 1, cur]`.

In simpler terms, `cur` will end up being the largest number in `N` that has a gap of at most 1 with the previous number in the sequence, and `M` will store how many times each such number appears in the list `N`.
