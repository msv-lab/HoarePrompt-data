Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and its value incremented by 1, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is `num` if `num > cur`, otherwise `cur` is -1, and `N` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces with one less element than before.**

Explanation:
- The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1.
- The other variables (`T`, `cnt`, `cur`, and `N`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
