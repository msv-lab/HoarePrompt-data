Output State: **`M` must have at least one key, and the value of `M[k]` is 1; `cnt` is a list containing the element `k`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt.append(k)` appends the value of `k` to the list `cnt`. Since `M[k]` was initially 1, the value of `k` is added to `cnt`. The precondition that `M` must have at least one key and the value of `M[k]` is 1 remains unchanged.
