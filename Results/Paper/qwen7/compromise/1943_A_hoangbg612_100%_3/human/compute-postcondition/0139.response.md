Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is -1, `N` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `M[-1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Given that `cur` is initially -1, `M[-1]` is incremented by 1, making its value 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
