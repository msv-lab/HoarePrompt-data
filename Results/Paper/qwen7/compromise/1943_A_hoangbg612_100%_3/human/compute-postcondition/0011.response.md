Output State: **`N` contains at least one element, the current value of `num` is greater than the current value of `cur` plus 1, `cur` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since `cur` was increased by 1 before the `break` statement, `cur` is now one more than its previous value. The `break` statement does not change the values of `N` or `num`, but it indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block.
