Output State: **`M` must have at least two keys; `cnt` is a list with the last element being the key `k`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt.append(k)` adds the key `k` to the list `cnt`. Since `M` must have at least two keys, its state remains unchanged. The list `cnt` now contains all its previous elements plus the key `k` as the last element.
