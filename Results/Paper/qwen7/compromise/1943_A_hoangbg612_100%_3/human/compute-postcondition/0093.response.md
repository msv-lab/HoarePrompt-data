Output State: **`N` is a list containing all elements except the one that was just processed (which is `num`), `cur` is the next element in this updated list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or if statement. This means that the operations inside the loop or if statement are not executed further, and the control moves to the next line of code outside the loop or if statement. The values of `N`, `cur`, and `M[cur]` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the loop or if statement is exited.
