Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is 1, and `cur` remains unchanged if `num <= cur + 1`, otherwise `cur` is increased by 1.**

This means that the dictionary `M` now has an entry where the key is the current value of `cur` (which is also the value of `num`), and the value is set to 1. Additionally, the value of `cur` will remain the same if the condition `num > cur + 1` is false, or it will be increased by 1 if the condition is true.
