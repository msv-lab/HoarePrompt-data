Output State: **The dictionary `M` is empty, and the list `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, since the loop condition `if M[k] == 1:` will eventually lead to all keys in `M` being checked and added to `cnt` (assuming all values in `M` were initially 1 or reduced to 1 during the loop), the dictionary `M` will be empty because all its keys have been processed. The list `cnt` will contain all keys that had a count of 1 in the dictionary `M`, as each such key was appended to `cnt` during each iteration of the loop.
