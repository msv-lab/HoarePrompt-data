Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is either `cur` or `num` and the value is 1, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `M[cur]` is now equal to 1, `cur` is now equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` updates the dictionary `M` by setting the value of the key `cur` to 1. It does not affect the value of `T`, `cnt`, or the fact that `cur` is now equal to `num`. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged except for the specific update to the dictionary `M`.
