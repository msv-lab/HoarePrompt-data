Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the keys of the dictionary `M`. Therefore, the objects involved are `k`, which represents the keys of the dictionary `M`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `k`**: Since the loop is iterating over the keys of `M`, the variable `k` will take on each key in the dictionary `M` during each iteration.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are keys in the dictionary `M`. The initial state of `M` is given as containing each unique element from `N` as a key with its corresponding count as the value, and the sum of all counts in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the dictionary `M` has at least one key for the loop to execute. Given that `M` contains each unique element from `N` as a key, it means `M` will always have at least one key (since `N` is non-empty).

5. **Final state adjustment**: The initial state of `cur`, `M`, `cnt`, and `S` does not directly affect whether the loop can execute. However, we need to ensure that `M` has at least one key for the loop to start.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the presence of keys in the dictionary `M`.

**State:**
- `M` must have at least one key.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`M` must have at least one key**
