Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` is a list containing all unique keys from the original dictionary `M` that had a value of 1, `cur` is the last integer processed in the list `N`, and `N` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the dictionary `M` will be empty because all keys that had a value of 1 in `M` were added to the list `cnt`. The list `cnt` will contain all such keys. The variable `cur` will be the last integer processed in the list `N`, and `N` itself will be an empty list as all elements have been processed.
