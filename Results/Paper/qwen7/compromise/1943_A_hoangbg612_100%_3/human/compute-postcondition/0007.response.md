Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N:`. The variables involved here are `num` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `num` is a variable that will take on the values from the list `N` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input on spaces and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `N`.
   - Before the loop starts, `num` will be set to the first element of `N` in the first iteration.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `num` will be set to the first element of `N` in the first iteration, we need to ensure that `N` is not empty.
   - `cur`, `T`, `S`, and `M` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that the list `N` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`N` must contain at least one element**
