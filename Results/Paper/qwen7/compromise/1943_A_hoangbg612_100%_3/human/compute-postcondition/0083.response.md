Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list, `cur` is the next element in the list `N` incremented by 1, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, and if `num` (the next element in `N`) is greater than `cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `num` is less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N`.**

This means that the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions involving `M[cur]`, `num`, and the comparison with `cur + 1` remain unchanged from the initial state.
