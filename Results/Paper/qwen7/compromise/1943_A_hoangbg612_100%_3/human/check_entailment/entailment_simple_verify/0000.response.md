### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the game rules and logic.

1. **Input Parsing and Sorting:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `N` itself.
   - It then sorts the array `N`.

2. **Dictionary Construction:**
   - The program initializes a dictionary `M` to keep track of the counts of each number in the sorted array.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the dictionary `M` based on the conditions:
     - If `num > cur` and `num > cur + 1`, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

3. **MEX Calculation:**
   - After constructing the dictionary `M`, the program checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S` (which should be `n`).
   - If they match, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then constructs a list `cnt` containing all keys from `M` that have a count of 1.
   - Finally, it sets `cur` to the second smallest key in `cnt` if `cnt` has at least two elements; otherwise, `cur` remains -1.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `cur`.

Now, let's compare this with the optimal strategy for the game:
- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c`.
- Alice always picks an element from `a` and appends it to `c` before deleting it from `a`.
- Bob only deletes an element from `a` without appending it to `c`.

Given these rules, the program does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Instead, it processes the entire array `N` as if it were a single sequence of moves by Alice and Bob combined. This is incorrect because the order of moves matters in determining the final state of `c`.

Moreover, the program does not handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob. It simply sorts the array and processes it linearly, which does not reflect the game's turn-based nature.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic. It does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob and does not properly compute the MEX of the final array `c` after both players have played optimally.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
