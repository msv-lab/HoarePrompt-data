Reasoning:
1. The problem requires processing multiple test cases, which is correctly handled by `func_1()`.
2. For each test case, `func_1()` reads the necessary inputs (`n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a`), sorts the array, and then calls `func_2(k, x, a)` with these parameters.
3. `func_2()` is designed to calculate the optimal sum of the array after Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob multiplies up to `x` elements by -1. It does this by iterating through possible scenarios of removals and negations and calculating the resulting sums.
4. The logic within `func_2()` considers all combinations of removals and negations to find the maximum possible sum, which aligns with the problem's requirements.
5. Both functions handle the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
