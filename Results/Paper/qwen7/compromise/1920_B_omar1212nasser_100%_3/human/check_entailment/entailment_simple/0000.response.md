### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Iterates through each test case, reading `n`, `k`, and `x` for each case.
   - Reads the list of integers `a` for each test case.
   - Sorts the list `a`.
   - Calls `func_2(k, x, a)` with the sorted list `a` and the parameters `k` and `x`.
   - Prints the result returned by `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2(removals, negatives, elements)`**:
   - Initializes an empty list `pos` to store results.
   - Calculates the initial sum `s` of the elements in `elements`.
   - Appends the value of `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` to `pos`. This represents the scenario where Alice removes the smallest elements and Bob multiplies the largest `negatives` elements by -1.
   - Iterates from 1 to `removals`, updating `s` and `s2` (sum of the last `negatives + i` elements) in each iteration.
   - Appends the value of `s - 2 * s2` to `pos` for each iteration.
   - Returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

### Analysis:

- The logic in `func_2` correctly simulates the optimal moves for both Alice and Bob:
  - Alice tries to minimize the sum by removing the smallest elements.
  - Bob tries to minimize the sum by multiplying the largest elements by -1.
- The sorting step ensures that the smallest elements are considered for removal, and the largest elements are considered for negation.
- The calculation `s - 2 * s2` in each iteration correctly reflects the sum of the array after Alice's removals and Bob's negations.
- The use of `max(pos)` ensures that the best possible outcome is selected.

Given that the logic and calculations align with the problem statement and the provided examples, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
