Output State: `pos` is a list containing the values calculated by the formula `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration of the loop, where `s` is the sum of all elements in the `elements` list and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives + i` elements of `elements` after each iteration. `removals` is the remaining number of elements Alice can remove after the loop, `negatives` is the remaining number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and these values are not affected by the loop.
