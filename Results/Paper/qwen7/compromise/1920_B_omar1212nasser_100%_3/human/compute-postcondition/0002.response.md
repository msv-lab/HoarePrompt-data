Output State: **`pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `s` is the sum of all elements in the list `elements`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` to the list `pos`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
