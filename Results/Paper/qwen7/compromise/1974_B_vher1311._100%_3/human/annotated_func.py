#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string where each character in the original 'encoded' string is replaced by its corresponding character as defined in the 'mapping' dictionary, with the mapping following the rule that keys (characters from 'r' in ascending order) map to values (characters from 'r' in descending order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character based on a specific mapping. This mapping is defined such that characters in the sorted unique set of `encoded` (in ascending order) map to characters in the same set (in descending order).
