Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input string `b` is empty. According to the problem description, the input string `b` will always have a length greater than or equal to 1. However, the program does not account for the case where `b` is empty, which would lead to an error when trying to access elements of `r` and `mapping`. 

To fix this, you should add a check at the beginning of the `func_1` function to handle the case where the input string `b` is empty. Here's an updated version of the function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    if not encoded:
        return ""
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))
```

This ensures that the function handles the edge case correctly and avoids potential errors.
