Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - Since `t` is within this range, `int(input())` will always return a positive integer (specifically, `t`).

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that the input value (`int(input()`) is valid and non-zero for the loop to execute.
   - Since `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 1000, we can directly use `t` as the loop counter.

4. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - The state before the loop should reflect that `t` is within the specified range and that `i` will start from 1 and increment until it reaches `t`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 1**
