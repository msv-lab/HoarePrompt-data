Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not always find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \(1 \le y < x\). The logic used in the solution, where `y = x // 2`, is too simplistic and does not guarantee the maximum value.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD). Specifically, we should look for a \(y\) such that \(\gcd(x, y)\) is maximized, and then add \(y\) to it to get the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Here's a corrected approach:

1. Iterate through all possible values of \(y\) from 1 to \(x-1\).
2. For each \(y\), compute \(\gcd(x, y)\).
3. Track the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) and the corresponding \(y\).

Let's implement this corrected solution:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        max_value = 0
        best_y = 0
        for y in range(1, x):
            current_value = gcd(x, y) + y
            if current_value > max_value:
                max_value = current_value
                best_y = y
        results.append(best_y)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This solution iterates through all possible values of \(y\) and keeps track of the one that gives the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). This ensures that the solution is correct according to the problem statement.
