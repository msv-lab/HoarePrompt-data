You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and similarly, the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `j` is equal to the initial value of `j` plus the total number of iterations the loop executed, and it is still less than `m`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer entered, `a` is the string input by the user, `b` is the string input by the user, `k` is the count of matching characters between `a` and `b` up to the point where `j` stopped, and for every index `i` from 0 to `j-1`, `b[j]` must be equal to `a[i]` if `j` did not reach `m` during the loop's execution.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the count of matching characters between `a` and `b` up to the point where `j` stopped)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) for each t, and two binary strings a and b (lengths n and m respectively). The function returns nothing directly but processes the given data to perform some operations or calculations based on the provided inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
