Output State: **`k` is increased by 1, `j` is equal to the original value of `j` plus 2, and `j` is less than `m`.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Given that `j` was originally equal to its original value plus the total number of iterations plus 1, after this increment, `j` will be equal to its original value plus the total number of iterations plus 2. The condition `j < m` remains satisfied.
