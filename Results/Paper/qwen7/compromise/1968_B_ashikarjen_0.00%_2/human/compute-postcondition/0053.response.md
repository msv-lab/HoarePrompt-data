Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) for each t, and two binary strings a and b (lengths n and m respectively). The function returns nothing directly but processes the given data to perform some operations or calculations based on the provided inputs.**
