Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `j` and `m`, and the condition also involves `b[j]` and `a[i]`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is equal to `j` + 2 and is still less than `m`.
   - `b[j] != a[i]` must remain true.

4. **Conditions for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions `j < m` and `b[j] != a[i]` must be true.
   - Since `j` is already incremented by 2 in the previous iteration and is still less than `m`, `j < m` is already satisfied.
   - To ensure `b[j] != a[i]` remains true, `b[j]` should not change to `a[i]` during the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting the states**:
   - `j` is incremented by 2, so it will be `j + 2` in the next iteration.
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `b[j]` should not become equal to `a[i]` in the next iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` (which will be incremented by 2), and `b[j]` should remain unequal to `a[i]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is equal to `j` + 4 and is still less than `m`, and `b[j]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**
