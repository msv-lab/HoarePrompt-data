Output State: **`removals` is an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is reduced by the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, `elements` is a list of integers, `pos` is an empty list, `s` is the sum of the elements in `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of the last `negatives` elements of the `elements` list and assigns it to `n`. The values of `removals`, `pos`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `negatives` is reduced by the number of elements used in the sum calculation.
