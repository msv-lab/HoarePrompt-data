Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (the number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (a list of integers). If `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a series of values based on removing and negating elements and returns the maximum value from this series.**
