You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: All iterations of the loop have completed. The variable `q` is equal to `t-1`, meaning the loop has executed `t` times. For each input string `s`, the variable `count` holds the number of times a character is followed by a smaller character, plus one if no such pair exists. The variable `flag` is 1 if there is at least one pair of consecutive characters where the first character is less than the second character, and 0 otherwise. The variable `i` is `-1` after the loop completes, indicating the end of the last iteration through the string `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that the entire string might be sorted without needing any cuts. For example, consider the input `000111`. According to the problem description, the entire string can be considered as one piece, and no cuts are needed since it is already sorted. However, the program would incorrectly count the number of cuts needed based on consecutive different characters, which in this case would be `2` (cuts between the first and second `0`, and between the last two `1`s), leading to an incorrect output of `2`.

To fix this, the program should check if the entire string is already sorted and output `1` in that case. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        if s == ''.join(sorted(s)):  # Check if the string is already sorted
            print(1)
        else:
            count = 0
            for i in range(len(s) - 1):
                if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                    count += 1
            print(count + 1)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles the case where the entire string is already sorted correctly.
