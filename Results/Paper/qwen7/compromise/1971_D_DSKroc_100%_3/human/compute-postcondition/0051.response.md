Output State: **`i` is `len(s) - 1`; `count` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `len(s) - 1`. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being `len(s) - 1` and `count` having been incremented by 1.
