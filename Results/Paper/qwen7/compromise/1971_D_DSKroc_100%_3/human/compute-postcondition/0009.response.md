Postcondition: `i` is 0, `s` is a string with length greater than 1. If the first character of `s` (converted to integer) is not equal to the second character of `s` (converted to integer), `count` is 1. If the first character of `s` (converted to integer) is equal to the second character of `s` (converted to integer), then `count` remains unchanged.
