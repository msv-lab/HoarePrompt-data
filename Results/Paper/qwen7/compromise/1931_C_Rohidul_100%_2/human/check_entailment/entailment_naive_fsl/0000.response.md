Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum cost is flawed. Hereâ€™s a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
The program's output is `4`, but the correct answer should be `2`.

To achieve the correct result, we need to consider the minimum length subarray that needs to be changed to match the entire array. The program only checks the boundaries and does not consider the possibility of having multiple segments that need to be changed independently.

A correct approach would involve identifying the longest segment of consecutive identical elements and then calculating the cost based on the remaining segments that need to be changed.
