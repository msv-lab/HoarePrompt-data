Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
2. The provided solution attempts to find the longest subarray where adjacent elements are equal and uses this to determine the minimum cost.
3. However, the logic in the provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum cost required to make all elements equal. Specifically:
   - The solution calculates the length of the longest subarray where adjacent elements are equal but does not consider the cost of operations.
   - The solution does not handle the case where the entire array needs to be changed to a single value.
   - The solution does not account for the cost of the operation, which is \((j - i + 1)\) burles.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
