### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - The operation allows us to set a subarray from index `i` to `j` to a value `x`, and the cost is `(j - i + 1)` burles.
   - The goal is to minimize the cost.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func()` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then uses two pointers (`l` and `r`) to find the longest prefix and suffix where all elements are the same.
   - `st` and `end` are used to count the length of these prefixes and suffixes.
   - After calculating the lengths of the prefix and suffix, it calculates the answer based on whether the entire array can be made uniform without any operation or with one operation.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for finding the longest prefix and suffix where all elements are the same is correct.
   - The cost calculation seems to be based on the idea of minimizing the cost by either:
     - Making the entire array uniform (if the entire array is already uniform).
     - Making only the non-uniform part uniform (if there is a uniform prefix and/or suffix).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases like arrays where the entire array is already uniform.
   - It correctly calculates the cost for making the non-uniform part uniform.

5. **Output Validation:**
   - The output matches the expected results given in the example.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It accurately finds the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.

**Correctness:** True
