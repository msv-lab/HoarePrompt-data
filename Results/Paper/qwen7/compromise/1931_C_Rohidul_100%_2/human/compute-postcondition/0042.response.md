Output State: **`ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `st` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `st` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `ans` is dependent on the values of `le`, `st`, and `end`, which are not altered by the given code snippet.
