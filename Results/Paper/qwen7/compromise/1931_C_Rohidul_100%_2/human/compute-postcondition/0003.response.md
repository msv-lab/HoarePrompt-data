Output State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

The code `le = len(a)` calculates the length of the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `le`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
