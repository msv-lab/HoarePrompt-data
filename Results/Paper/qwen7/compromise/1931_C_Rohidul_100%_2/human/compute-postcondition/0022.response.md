Output State: **`end` is 3, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `r - 1`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `a[n - 3]` must be equal to `a[n - 4]`**.

The value of `end` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
