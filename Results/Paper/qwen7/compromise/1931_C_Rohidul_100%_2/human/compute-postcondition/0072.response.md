Output State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values 1 to both `st` and `end`. The values of `le`, `n`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
