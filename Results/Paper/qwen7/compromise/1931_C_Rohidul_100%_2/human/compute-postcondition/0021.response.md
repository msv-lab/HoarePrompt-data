Output State: **`end` is 2, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `r - 1`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `a[n - 3]` must be equal to `a[n - 4]`**.

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `r` is now `n - 4`.
