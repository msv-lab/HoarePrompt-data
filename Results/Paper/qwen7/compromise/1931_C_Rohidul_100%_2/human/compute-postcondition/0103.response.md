Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value `t`, another value `n`, and a list of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, adhering to the specified constraints.
