Output State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 2, `end` is 1, `a[0] == a[1]`, and `a[1] == a[2]`**.

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
