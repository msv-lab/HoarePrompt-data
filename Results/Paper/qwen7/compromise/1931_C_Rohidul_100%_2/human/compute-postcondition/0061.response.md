Output State: **`ans` is `le - max(2 * (n - l - 1), end + 3)`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` is equal to `r - 5`, `r` is equal to `n - 7`, `st` is equal to `2 * (r - l - 1)`, `end` is increased by 3.**

Explanation:
- The initial state of `ans` is given as `max(0, le - (st + end + 3))`.
- The code updates `ans` to `le - max(st, end)`.
- `st` is defined as `2 * (r - l - 1)`, and `end` is increased by 3.
- Since `st` is already defined, it remains unchanged.
- The updated `ans` is now `le - max(st, end + 3)`, which simplifies to `le - max(2 * (n - l - 1), end + 3)` based on the definitions of `st` and `end`.

All other variables (`le`, `t`, `n`, `a[0]`, `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end`) remain as per their initial conditions.
