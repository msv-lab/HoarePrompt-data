Output State: **`ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 4, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`, `l` is equal to `r - 2`, `r` is equal to `n - 5`, `st` is equal to `2 * (r - l - 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1. Initially, `r` was equal to `n - 4`. After decrementing `r` by 1, the new value of `r` becomes `n - 5`. All other variables remain unchanged.
