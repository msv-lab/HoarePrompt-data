Output State: **`ans` is `max(0, le - (st + end))`, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `n - 4`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 4`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n - 1`. Since `r` was previously set to `n - 4`, the new value of `r` is `n - 4`. The values of `ans`, `le`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `l`, and `st` remain unchanged from their previous states.
