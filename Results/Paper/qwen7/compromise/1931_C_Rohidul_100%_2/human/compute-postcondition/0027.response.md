Output State: `end` is 4, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `n - 4`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `a[n - 4]` must be equal to `a[n - 5]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `r` will eventually reach a point where it is no longer greater than `l` or the condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is no longer true. Given the pattern, after 3 iterations, `r` is `n - 3`. For the 4th iteration, `r` will decrement to `n - 4`, and the loop will check if `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`. Since the loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `r` will decrement again to `n - 5` and `end` will increment to 4. At this point, the loop will exit because `r` will no longer satisfy the condition `r > l`. Thus, `r` becomes `n - 4` and `end` is 4, indicating that 4 consecutive elements were found to be equal starting from index 0.
