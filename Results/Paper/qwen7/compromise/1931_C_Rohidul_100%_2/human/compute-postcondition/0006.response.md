Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
   - Variables involved: `l`, `r`, and `a`.

2. **Analyze each variable**:
   - **`l`**: Currently, `l` is 0.
   - **`r`**: Currently, `r` is `n - 1`.
   - **`a`**: This is a list of integers.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than `r` and the elements at indices `l` and `l + 1` in the list `a` must be equal.

4. **Check the current state**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `a[0] == a[1]` for the loop to execute the first time.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `l` is 0, we need to check if `a[0] == a[1]`.
   - If `a[0] != a[1]`, the loop will not execute even once because `l < r` will be false initially.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `a[0] == a[1]` for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 1, and `a[0] == a[1]`**.
