Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer using the `int()` function, assigning the result to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `n` is set to the integer value of the input provided by the user.
