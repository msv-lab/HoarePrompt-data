Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `end` is 2
   - `le` is the length of list `a`
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers
   - `l` is equal to `r - 1`
   - `r` is now `n - 3`
   - `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0
   - `a[0] == a[1]` holds until `l` reaches `r - 1`

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition checks two things: `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
   - From the current state, we know `l = r - 1` and `r = n - 3`.
   - Therefore, `r > l` simplifies to `r > r - 1`, which is always true.
   - The second part of the condition, `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, is given as true until `l` reaches `r - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `r > l` is always true, no adjustment is needed for this part.
   - We need to ensure that `a[r] == a[r - 1]` remains true for the next iteration. This means `a[n - 3]` should be equal to `a[n - 4]`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `a[n - 3]` to ensure it equals `a[n - 4]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`end` is 2, `le` is the length of list `a`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is now `n - 3`, `st` is the total number of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal starting from index 0, `a[n - 3]` must be equal to `a[n - 4]`**.
