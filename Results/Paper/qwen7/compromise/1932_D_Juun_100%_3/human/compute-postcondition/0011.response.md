Output State: `trumps` is an empty list, `t` is the number of cards processed, `n` is the number of non-empty suits encountered, `answers` is a list containing strings representing pairs of ranks and suits that were already paired, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values set to either the highest rank encountered for each suit or None if no rank was encountered. After the loop executes, `trumps` has been emptied, and for each suit with a non-None rank, a pair with a rank from `trumps` has been appended to `answers`. If a suit had no rank, 'IMPOSSIBLE' was printed and the function would have returned, but since we are only describing the final state, we assume no such suit existed.
