Output State: **`res` is 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `nums` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that element appears in `nums`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must contain at least three elements, and `x` is the last element of `nums` after all iterations of the loop have completed.**

Explanation: The code snippet `res = 0` simply initializes or resets the variable `res` to 0. Since `res` was initially 0 and this line does not affect any other variables, the values of `num_of_lens`, `n`, `nums`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
