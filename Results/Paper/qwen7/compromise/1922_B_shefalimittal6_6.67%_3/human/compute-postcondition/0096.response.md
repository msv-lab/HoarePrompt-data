Output State: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from the list `nums` is mapped to its frequency in `nums`, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.

In this final state, the loop has iterated through all elements in the original `nums` list, updating the `num_of_lens` dictionary to reflect the count of each integer in the list. The `nums` list is now empty as all elements have been processed. The values of `res`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
