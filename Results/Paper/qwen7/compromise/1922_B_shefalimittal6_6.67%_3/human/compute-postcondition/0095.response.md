Output State: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from the list `nums` is mapped to its frequency (count) in the list, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain the frequency count of each number present in the original list `nums`. The variable `res` will retain its sum of combinations value, `t` will still be 0 or negative, `n` will remain as the input integer it was initialized as, and `nums` will be an empty list because all elements have been processed in the loop.
