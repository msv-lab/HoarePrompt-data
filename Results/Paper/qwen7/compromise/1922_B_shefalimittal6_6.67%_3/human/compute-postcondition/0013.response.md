Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from the list `nums` has a value representing how many times that key appears in `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers that must contain at least 3 elements, `res` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `res` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, or `nums`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `res` set to 0.
