Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    num_of_lens = {}
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for x in nums:
        num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
    res = 0
    for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
        if cnt >= 3:
            res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
        if cnt >= 2:
            total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
            res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `res` will be the sum of several terms based on the values in `num_of_lens`. Specifically, for each key `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, `res` will be incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Additionally, for each `cnt` that is greater than or equal to 2, `res` will be further incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All key-value pairs in `num_of_lens` have been processed, and `res` contains the sum of combinations calculated based on the counts of each element in `nums` as described by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each unique value in `nums`. `res` is the cumulative result of adding `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for every `cnt` (frequency) that is 3 or more, and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for every `cnt` (frequency) that is 2 or more, where `total_sum` is the sum of all frequencies in `num_of_lens.values()` except for the current `cnt`. `t` remains 0 or negative, `n` is the input integer, `nums` is an empty list, and the loop processes all values in `num_of_lens.values()` according to their conditions.

In simpler terms, `res` will be the sum of combinations calculated based on the frequencies of numbers in `nums`, specifically:
- For every frequency of 3 or more, add the combination of choosing 3 out of that frequency.
- For every frequency of 2 or more, add twice the product of the combination of choosing 2 out of that frequency and the sum of all other frequencies.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
