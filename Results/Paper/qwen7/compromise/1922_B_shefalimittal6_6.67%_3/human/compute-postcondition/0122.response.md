Postcondition: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value, `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 3) + 2 * math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt >= 2`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged. `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` that satisfies `cnt >= 3`, and `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding `cnt`.**
