Output State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`; `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt` and assigns it to `total_sum`. It does not affect `num_of_lens` itself, nor does it change `res` unless `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, in which case `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2)`.
