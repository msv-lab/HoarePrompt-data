Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens[next_x]` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num_of_lens[x]` to be the count of occurrences of `x` in the dictionary. Since `x` is `next_x` and its initial value is 2, the value of `num_of_lens[next_x]` is incremented by 1 from its initial value of 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
