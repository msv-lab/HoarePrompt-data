Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from the list `nums` has a value representing how many times that key appears in `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers that must contain at least 3 elements.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the `nums` list as a key, with the corresponding value being the count of how many times that integer appears in the list. The variable `t` remains unchanged within the given range, and `n` also remains unchanged as it was an input integer not affected by the loop.
