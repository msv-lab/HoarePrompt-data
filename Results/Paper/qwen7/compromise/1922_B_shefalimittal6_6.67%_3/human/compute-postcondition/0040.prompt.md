Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from the list `nums` has a value representing how many times that key appears in `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers that must contain at least 3 elements, `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is not an empty dictionary, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` or `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, and the value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `res` is the original value of `res` plus the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is further incremented by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `res` is the original value of `res`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to the original value of `res` plus the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` times `total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
