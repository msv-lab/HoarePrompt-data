Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key `x` and value 3, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `x` is the third element of `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1` increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Since `x` was previously set to the third element of `nums` and its count was 2, incrementing it by 1 changes the value to 3. The other variables (`res`, `n`, `nums`) remain unchanged.
