Output State: **`res` is the original value of `res` plus the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` times `total_sum`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. The value of `total_sum` remains unchanged from its previous state, which is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`. The value of `res` is updated to include the new value calculated from `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum`.
