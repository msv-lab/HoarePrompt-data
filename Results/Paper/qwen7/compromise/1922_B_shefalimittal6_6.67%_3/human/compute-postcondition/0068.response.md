Output State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` updates the value of `res` by adding the result of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to its current value. The precondition states that if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. However, the code here changes the combinatorial calculation from `math.comb(cnt, 2)` to `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `cnt`, the updated rule for `res` is that it is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and remains unchanged otherwise. The precondition about `num_of_lens` remains unaffected.
