Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `num_of_lens`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `t` and `n` remain the same, and `num_of_lens` is now an empty dictionary.
