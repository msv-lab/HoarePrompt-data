Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `cnt`, which is iterating over the values of `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are values in `num_of_lens.values()`. This means the loop will execute if `num_of_lens` is not an empty dictionary.

3. **Initial State**: 
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from the list `nums` is mapped to its frequency in `nums`.
   - `res` is 0.
   - `t` is 0 or negative.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is an empty list.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop depends on `num_of_lens.values()`, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value for the loop to execute.
   - `res` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `t` and `n` are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they don't need to be adjusted.
   - `nums` being an empty list does not affect the loop condition since the loop iterates over `num_of_lens.values()`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num_of_lens` to ensure it contains at least one value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value, res is 0, t is 0 or negative, n is an input integer, nums is an empty list**
