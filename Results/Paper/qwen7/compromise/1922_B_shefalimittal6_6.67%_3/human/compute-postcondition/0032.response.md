Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `cnt` is derived from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - The loop variable `cnt` is used in the expressions `math.comb(cnt, 3)` and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are values in `num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `num_of_lens.values()`, the only variable that changes with each iteration is `cnt`.
   - The postcondition mentions that `res` is updated based on the current value of `cnt`. Therefore, `res` will be updated in each iteration based on the current `cnt`.

4. **Update the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `res` was updated according to the current value of `cnt`.
   - For the next iteration, `cnt` will be the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `res` will be updated again based on this new value of `cnt`.

Given the above reasoning, let's formulate the state adjustments:

- The value of `cnt` will change to the next key from `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `res` will be updated based on the new value of `cnt`.

Since the exact values of `num_of_lens` and `total_sum` are not provided, we cannot specify the exact numerical values. However, we know that `cnt` will be the next key from `num_of_lens.values()` and `res` will be updated accordingly.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`res` is the original value of `res` plus the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` where `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` is further incremented by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.**
