Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` is 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `nums` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that element appears in `nums`, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must contain at least three elements, and `x` is the last element of `nums` after all iterations of the loop have completed.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`; if `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens` excluding `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `cnt` is updated to the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` remains the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the current value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged and `cnt` is updated to the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
