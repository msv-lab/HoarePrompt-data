Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the values of the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Therefore, the objects involved in the loop head are `cnt` (which takes the values from `num_of_lens.values()`) and implicitly the dictionary `num_of_lens`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `cnt`**: Since `cnt` takes values from `num_of_lens.values()`, it will start with one of the values present in the dictionary. However, the exact value of `cnt` at the start of the loop cannot be determined without knowing the contents of `num_of_lens`. But we know that the loop will execute as long as there are values in `num_of_lens`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair. This means that `num_of_lens` must not be an empty dictionary.

4. **Consider other given states**: The states of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `res` need to be considered. Specifically, `nums` must contain at least 3 elements, but this is not directly relevant to the loop condition since the loop is iterating over the dictionary `num_of_lens`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `num_of_lens` is not empty for the loop to execute. The other states (`t`, `n`, and `res`) are not directly related to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop itself.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `num_of_lens` must not be an empty dictionary.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from the list `nums` has a value representing how many times that key appears in `nums`
- `nums` is a list of integers that must contain at least 3 elements
- `res` is 0

The final answer is:

**State: **`num_of_lens` is not an empty dictionary**
