Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `x`, which iterates over the elements in the list `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `x`**: Since `x` is being assigned values from the list `nums` during each iteration of the loop, the initial state of `x` is irrelevant because it changes within the loop.

3. **Determine the initial state of `nums`**: The list `nums` is already defined as a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `nums` itself.

4. **Determine the initial state of `num_of_lens`**: The dictionary `num_of_lens` is initially empty. This means that before the loop starts, `num_of_lens` should be an empty dictionary.

5. **Consider the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `nums`. Therefore, `nums` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the only adjustments needed are related to the list `nums` ensuring it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, num_of_lens is an empty dictionary, nums is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element**
