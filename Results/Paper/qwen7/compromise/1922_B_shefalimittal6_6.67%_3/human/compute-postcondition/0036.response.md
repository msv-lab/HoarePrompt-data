Output State: **`res` is the original value of `res` plus the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`.
- The value of `res` remains unchanged unless `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, in which case `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to its original value.
- The variable `cnt` is used in both the calculation of `total_sum` and the condition to update `res`, but its value does not change within the given code snippet.
