Output State: **All key-value pairs in `num_of_lens` have been processed, and `res` contains the sum of combinations calculated based on the counts of each element in `nums` as described by the loop.**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the variable `res` will hold the cumulative result of the following operations:
- For each count `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, `math.comb(cnt, 3)` is added to `res`.
- For each count `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` is added to `res`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all other counts in `num_of_lens`.

The loop processes each count in `num_of_lens.values()` exactly once, ensuring that all possible combinations contributing to `res` are accounted for according to the conditions specified in the loop body. The final value of `res` reflects the total contribution from all valid counts in `num_of_lens`.
