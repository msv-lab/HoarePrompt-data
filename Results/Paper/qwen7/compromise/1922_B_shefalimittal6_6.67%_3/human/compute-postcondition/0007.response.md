Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in nums:`. This means the variables `x`, `nums`, and `num_of_lens` are relevant to the loop head.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the `nums` list.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` and value 1 more than the previous count of `x`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `nums`, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in `nums`.
   - The length of `nums` will decrease by 1 because one element has been processed.
   - `num_of_lens` will be updated based on the current value of `x`.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `t` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
- `num_of_lens` will be updated, but its exact state is not specified in the question, so we focus on the other variables.
- `nums` will have one less element, and `x` will be the next element in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` and value 1 more than the previous count of `x`, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element (one less than before)**.

However, to be precise, we need to specify the new value of `x` and the updated length of `nums`. Since we don't know the exact value of `x` from the previous iteration, we'll denote it as `next_x`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `next_x` and value 1 more than the previous count of `next_x`, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element (one less than before)**.
