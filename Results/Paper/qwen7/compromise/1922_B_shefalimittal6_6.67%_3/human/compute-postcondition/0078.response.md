Postcondition: `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is updated to the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged and `cnt` is updated to the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.
