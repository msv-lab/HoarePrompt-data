Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in nums`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x`, `nums`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` and its value is 2.
   - `res` contains the sum of combinations.
   - `t` is 0 or negative.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `x` is iterating over `nums`, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in `nums`.
   - `nums` must have at least one element remaining for the loop to continue. Therefore, `nums` should have at least one element left after removing the current `x`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `x` will be the next element in `nums`.
- `nums` must have at least one element remaining.

Since `nums` must have at least one element remaining, and `x` is the next element to be processed, `nums` should still contain all elements except the one that was just processed (if it had more than one element).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` and its value is 2, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining, and `x` is the next element in `nums`**.

However, since we need to specify the exact state, we can assume `x` is the next element in `nums` and `nums` still has at least one element remaining.

Final State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` and its value is 2, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining, and `x` is the next element in `nums`**.

For simplicity, we can represent it as:

State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` and its value is 2, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining, and `x` is the next element in `nums`**.

To summarize:

State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `x` and its value is 2, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining, and `x` is the next element in `nums`**.
