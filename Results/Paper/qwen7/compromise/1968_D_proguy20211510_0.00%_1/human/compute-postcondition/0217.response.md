Output State: **`founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True indicating that an element matching `maxa` has been found, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with three elements where the first is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, the second is the original element, and the third is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `b` includes `a[pb - 1]` as the third element. `s` now contains `maxa`, and the loop or if statement is broken.**

Explanation: The code appends `maxa` to the list `s`. Since `founds` was initially a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, and `foundb` was True indicating that an element matching `maxa` has been found, these values remain unchanged. The value of `i` and `k` also remain unchanged. The list `b` remains the same as its previous state, and `s` now contains `maxa` due to the append operation. The loop or if statement is broken as specified.
