Output State: **`i` is 12, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - 13`**

Explanation: The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k - (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 12, the expression simplifies to `k - 13`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `k` is treated as an input integer since its value is not provided. The length of `pres` remains unchanged at 4.
