Output State: **`founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is the element at index `pb - 1` of list `a`, and the element at index `pb - 1` of list `a` is appended to list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `pb = p[pb - 1]` assigns the value at index `pb - 1` of list `p` to the variable `pb`. However, since `p` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `pb`. But we know that `pb` now holds the value from the list `p` at the specified index. All other variables remain unchanged.
