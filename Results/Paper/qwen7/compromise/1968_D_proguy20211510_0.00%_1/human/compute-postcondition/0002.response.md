Output State: **t is a positive integer, YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**

The code initializes the variable `alpha` with the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `YES`, `NO`, or `MOD`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
