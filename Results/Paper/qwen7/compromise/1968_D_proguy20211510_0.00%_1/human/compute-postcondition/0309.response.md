Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` is the input integer, `pb` is the input integer, `ps` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, and `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, then `a[ps - 1]` does not change. Otherwise, if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, no changes are made to the variables.**
