Output State: **`i` is 13, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` has an element equal to `preb[12] + (k - 13) * b[12]`, `ptss` is a list with one element equal to `pres[12] + rem * s[12]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rem` to `k - (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 13, `rem` becomes `k - 14`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
