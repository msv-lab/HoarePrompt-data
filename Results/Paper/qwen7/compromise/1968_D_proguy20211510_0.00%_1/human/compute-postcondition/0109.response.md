Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`; `sb` is `sb + b[k - 1]`; `pres` is `pres + [ss + s[k - 1]]`; `ss` is `ss + s[k - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by `s[i]`. Given that `i` is initially `k - 1`, the updated value of `ss` becomes `ss + s[k - 1]`. The other variables (`sb` and `pres`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
