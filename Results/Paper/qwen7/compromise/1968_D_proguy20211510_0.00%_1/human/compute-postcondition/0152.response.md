Output State: **`maxs` is the maximum value of `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value of `ptsb`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `ptsb` is calculated as the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` is calculated as the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for all `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`, `n` is converted to an integer from the first part of the input split by space, `k` is converted to an integer from the second part of the input split by space, `pb` is converted to an integer from the third part of the input split by space, `ps` is converted to an integer from the fourth part of the input split by space.**

In this output state, the variables `maxs` and `maxb` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The variables `i` and `rem` also remain unchanged as their values were not altered. The cumulative sums `ptsb` and `ptss` are recalculated using the updated values of `n` and `k`. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are updated to their integer values from the input split by space.
