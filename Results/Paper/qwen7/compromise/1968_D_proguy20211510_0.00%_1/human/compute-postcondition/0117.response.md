Output State: **`i` is `k + 3`, `sb` is `sb + b[k] + b[k + 2] + b[i]`, `pres` is `[pres[0], ss + s[k + 3]]`, `ss` is `ss + s[k + 3] + s[k + 3]`, `preb` is `[sb + b[k + 2], sb + b[k + 2] + b[k + 3]]**.

Explanation: The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still `k + 3`. The variable `sb` is updated by adding `b[i]` to its current value, which is `sb + b[k] + b[k + 2]`. All other variables (`pres`, `ss`, and `preb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
