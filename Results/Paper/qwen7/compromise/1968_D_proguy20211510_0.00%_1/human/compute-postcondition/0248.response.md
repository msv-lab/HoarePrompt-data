Postcondition: `founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True indicating that an element matching `maxa` has been found, `i` is 4, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with five elements where the first is 0, the second is the original element, the third is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]`, the fourth is 0, and the fifth is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]`. Additionally, `s` is a list containing either one or two elements where the first is 0, and if `s` contains two elements, the second is either `a[ps - 1]` or `maxa`, and `ps` is equal to `p[ps - 1]` if the condition `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is met; otherwise, `s` is a list containing two zeros.
