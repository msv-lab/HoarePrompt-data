Output State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the input integer or updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing either two or four elements now including `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list containing five elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`, and the additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `founds` and `foundb` are `False`, `i` is 5, `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` if `founds` is `True`, otherwise `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. If `founds` is `True`, `s` includes `maxa` as its fifth element, otherwise `s` includes `a[ps - 1]` as its fifth element. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this step, the value of `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
