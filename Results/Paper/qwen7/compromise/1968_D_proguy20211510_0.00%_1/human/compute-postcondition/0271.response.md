Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop head.
   - The loop runs for `range(len(pres))`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The initial value of `i` is given as `i = k + len(s)`.
   - Since `k > 0` and `len(s)` is the length of the list `s`, `i` is initialized to a value that is greater than `len(pres)` (since `len(pres) = len(s)`).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will run as long as `i < len(pres)`.
   - Given that `i` is initially set to `k + len(s)` and `k > 0`, `i` is greater than `len(s)`, and hence greater than `len(pres)` (since `len(pres) = len(s)`).
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute because `i` is not within the range defined by `range(len(pres))`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be within the range of `range(len(pres))`.
   - This means `i` must be less than or equal to `len(pres)`.

### Final State Adjustment:

Given the analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be within the valid range of `range(len(pres))`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` must be less than or equal to `len(pres)`**.

This ensures that the loop can execute as intended.
