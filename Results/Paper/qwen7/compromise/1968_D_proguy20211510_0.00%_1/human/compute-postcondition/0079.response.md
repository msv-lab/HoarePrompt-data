Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing four elements where the first three elements are the same as before and the fourth element is `maxa` if `foundb` is `True` or `a[pb - 1]` if `foundb` is `False`, `s` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `a[ps - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` is appended to `s`, `founds` is `True` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `False`, `foundb` is `True` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `False`, `i` is 4, and `k` must be greater than 3.**

The code `ps = p[ps - 1]` updates the value of `ps` to be the last element of the list `p`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
