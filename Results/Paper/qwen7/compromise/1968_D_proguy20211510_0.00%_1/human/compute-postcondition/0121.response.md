Output State: `i` is `-1`; `sb` is the sum of all elements in list `b`; `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in list `s`; `ss` is the sum of all elements in list `s`; `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in list `b` up to each index.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will decrement below 0 (since it starts at `k-1` and `k` is the length of list `s`, so `i` will become `-1` after the loop). The variable `sb` will be the sum of all elements in list `b` because it accumulates the sum of `b[i]` in each iteration. Similarly, `ss` will be the sum of all elements in list `s` as it accumulates `s[i]` in each iteration. The list `pres` will contain the cumulative sums of all elements in list `s`, starting from `ss + s[0]` and adding each subsequent element of `s` to the previous cumulative sum. The list `preb` will contain the cumulative sums of all elements in list `b`, starting from `sb + b[k-1]` and adding each subsequent element of `b` to the previous cumulative sum.
