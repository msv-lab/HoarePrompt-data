Output State: **`founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, `s` has appended `a[ps - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `s.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the element `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. However, the initial state does not provide the exact value of `ps`, so we cannot specify what exactly was appended. The values of `founds`, `foundb`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 due to the nature of the operation, making it 2.
