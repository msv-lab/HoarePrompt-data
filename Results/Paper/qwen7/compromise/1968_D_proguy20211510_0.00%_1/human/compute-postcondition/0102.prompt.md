Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and the second element is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]` or `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]` depending on the value of `foundb`, `s` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is either `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`, `founds` is `True` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `False`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 2, and `k` must be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing four elements where the first three elements are the same as before and the fourth element is `maxa` if `foundb` is `True` or `a[pb - 1]` if `foundb` is `False`, `s` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` is appended to `s` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `founds` is `True` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `False`, `foundb` is `True` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `False`, `i` is 4, and `k` must be greater than 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing four elements where the first three elements are the same as before and the fourth element is `a[pb - 1]` if `foundb` is `True` or `(k - 6) * maxa` if `foundb` is `False`, `s` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - 6) * maxa` and the second element is `a[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` is appended to `s` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `founds` is `True` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `False`, `foundb` is `True` if `a[pb - 1] == (k - 6) * maxa` or `False`, `i` is either 6 or 7 depending on whether the if condition is met or not, and `k` must be greater than 3. If `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, `i` is set to 7.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
