Postcondition: `founds` is False, `foundb` is True, `i` is 2, and `k` is greater than 0. Additionally, `b` contains the element `a[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, then `s` also contains `a[ps - 1]`. Otherwise, `s` does not contain `a[ps - 1]` and `ps` is the element at index `ps - 1` of list `a` and this element is appended to list `b`.
