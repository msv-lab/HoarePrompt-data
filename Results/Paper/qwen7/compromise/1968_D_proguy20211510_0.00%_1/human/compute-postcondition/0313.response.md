Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function arguments, which include `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the variables in the loop head**:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - `k`: This is the input integer.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.
   - Therefore, the loop can execute if `k` is at least 1 (since `i` starts at 0).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0, which is correct for the loop to start.

5. **List the necessary adjustments**:
   - Adjust `k` to be greater than 0.
   - Ensure `i` is 0 (which is already the default).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

**State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is the input integer, `ps` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 0**
