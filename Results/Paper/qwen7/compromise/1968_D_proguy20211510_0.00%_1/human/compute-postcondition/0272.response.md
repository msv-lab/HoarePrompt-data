Output State: **`i` is within the range of `range(len(pres))`; `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `rem = k - (i + 1)` calculates the value of `rem` based on the current value of `i` and the value of `k`. Since `i` must be within the range of `range(len(pres))`, it means `i` is less than or equal to `len(pres) - 1`. After executing the line of code, the value of `rem` is updated to `k - (i + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
