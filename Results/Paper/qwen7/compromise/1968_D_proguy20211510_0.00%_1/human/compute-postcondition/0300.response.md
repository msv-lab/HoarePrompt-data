Output State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` is the input integer, `pb` is the input integer, `ps` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`.**

Explanation: The line `maxa = max(a)` calculates the maximum value in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `maxa`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
