Output State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is either the input integer or updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the input integer or updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing either two or four elements depending on the condition, `s` is a list containing five elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`, and the additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `founds` and `foundb` are either both `True` or both `False`, `i` is 5, `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` if `founds` is `True`, otherwise `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. If `founds` is `True`, `s` includes `maxa` as its fifth element, otherwise `s` includes `a[ps - 1]` as its fifth element, `s` now includes `a[ps - 1]` as its fifth element.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `s` has appended the value of `a[ps - 1]` as its fifth element. All other variables retain their previous states.
