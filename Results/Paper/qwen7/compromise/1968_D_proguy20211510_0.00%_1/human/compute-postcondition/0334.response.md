Output State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is either the input integer or updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing two elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list containing two elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`, `founds` is `True`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 2, and `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` since `founds` is `True`.**

Explanation: The code `s.append(maxa)` appends the value of `maxa` to the list `s`. Since `s` initially contained one element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, after appending `maxa`, `s` now contains two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
