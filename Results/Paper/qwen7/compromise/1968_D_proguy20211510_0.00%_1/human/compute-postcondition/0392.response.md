Output State: **`i` is 8; `sb` is `preb + b[6]`; `pres` is a list with the element `ss + s[7]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. Given that `i` was initially 7, after the execution of the line `i += 1`, `i` becomes 8. The value of `sb` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code snippet. The list `pres` now contains one additional element, which is `ss + s[7]`.
