Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, all elements in `ptsb` and `ptss` are calculated as specified. The value of `maxs` remains unchanged if `maxs` is not greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` remains the maximum value among all elements in `ptss`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. After each iteration, the input value decreases by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the input value must still be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to decrement the input value by 1.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated input value.

**State: **All elements in `ptsb` and `ptss` are calculated as specified, the value of `maxs` remains unchanged if `maxs` is not greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` remains the maximum value among all elements in `ptss`, and the input value is decremented by 1.**
