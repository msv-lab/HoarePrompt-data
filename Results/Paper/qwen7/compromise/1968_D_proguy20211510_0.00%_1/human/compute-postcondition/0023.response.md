The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`. Additionally, `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa` and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `a[ps - 1]` and both `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are equal to `maxa`.**
