Postcondition: `founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True indicating that an element matching `maxa` has been found, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with three elements where the first is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, the second is the original element, and the third is `maxa` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, otherwise it is `a[pb - 1]`. `s` contains the element from `a` that matches the conditions specified in the if part if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, otherwise it contains `a[ps - 1]` and the loop or if statement is broken.
