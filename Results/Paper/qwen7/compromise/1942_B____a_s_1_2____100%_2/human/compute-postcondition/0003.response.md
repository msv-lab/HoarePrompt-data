Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements based on whitespace, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was just an input integer before this operation.
