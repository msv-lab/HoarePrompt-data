Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that -`n` ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and there exists at least one valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions.**

This means that the variable `t` has been updated to the integer value entered by the user, which falls within the range of 1 to 10^4. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state, with `n` being an integer between 1 and 2·10^5, and `a` being a list of `n` integers each within the range of -`n` to `n`.
