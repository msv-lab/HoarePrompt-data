Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.
   - `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`.
   - This means the loop starts from `n - 1` and decrements `i` until `i` reaches `-1`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 2`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 3`.
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, the new value of `i` will be `n - 3`.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.
   - `mex` and `p[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is `n - 3`).

5. **Updated State:**
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is now `n - 3`.
   - `mex` and `p[i]` will be updated according to the loop body, but their exact values depend on the loop body, which is omitted.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `mex` and `p[i]` will be updated based on the loop body.**
