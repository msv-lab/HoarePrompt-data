Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]`
- `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`
- `n` is greater than 0

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts from `n - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been decremented by 1 from its initial value.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 2`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged within the loop unless explicitly modified inside the loop body.
   - Since no modification of `n` is mentioned, `n` still needs to be greater than 0.

3. **Variable `mex`:**
   - `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` during each iteration.
   - However, the exact value of `mex` after the previous iteration is not provided, so we cannot specify its exact value. We only know that `mex` is updated based on `p[i]` but not its exact value.

4. **Array `p`:**
   - `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]` at the end of each iteration.
   - Since `i` is decremented by 1, the value of `p[i]` at the start of the next iteration would be `p[n - 2]`.

### Conclusion:
- `i` should be `n - 2`.
- `n` should still be greater than 0.
- `mex` is updated but its exact value is not specified.
- `p[i]` at the start of the next iteration is `p[n - 2]`.

### Final State:
State: **`p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]` where `i` is `n - 2`, `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0.**
