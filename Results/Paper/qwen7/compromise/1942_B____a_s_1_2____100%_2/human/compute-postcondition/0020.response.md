Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[0]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits them into a list `a`. The values of `n`, `i`, `mex`, and `p` are not directly affected by this operation. The list `a` is created based on the input, and the other variables retain their previous states.
