Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n-2`; `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`; `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Since `i` is `n-2`, the value of `p[i]` is now specifically `mex - a[i]`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
