Output: **mex - a[0] mex - a[1] ... mex - a[n-1]** 

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is set to 0.
- `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[0]`.
- For each `i` in the range of `n`, `p[i]` is updated to be `mex - a[i]`.

After the loop completes, the list `p` will contain the values `mex - a[0]`, `mex - a[1]`, ..., `mex - a[n-1]`. Therefore, when `print(*p)` is executed, it will print these values separated by spaces.
