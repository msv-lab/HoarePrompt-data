Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `_`, but since `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable (it's often just a placeholder), we don't need to adjust its state.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input from the user and it is guaranteed to be between 1 and \(10^4\), `t` being greater than 0 is always true in this context.
   - However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute multiple times if `t` is greater than 1.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 so that the loop can execute at least once.
   - If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute multiple times.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
