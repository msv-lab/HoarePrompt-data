Output State: **`mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[n-2]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`, where `i` is `n-2`. Since `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]` for `i = n-2`, `p[n-2]` is already defined in terms of `mex` and `a[n-2]`. However, without specific values for `mex` and `a[n-2]`, we can only say that `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[n-2]`.
