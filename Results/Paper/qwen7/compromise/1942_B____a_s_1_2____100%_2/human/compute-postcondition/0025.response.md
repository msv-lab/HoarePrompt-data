Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p[0]` is `mex - a[0]`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum between the old `mex` and `p[0]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum between its current value (`mex`) and the value of `p[0]`. Since `p[0]` is equal to `mex - a[0]`, the new value of `mex` will be the minimum of `mex` and `mex - a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
