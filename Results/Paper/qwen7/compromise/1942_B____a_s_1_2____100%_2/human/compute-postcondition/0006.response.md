Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop runs in reverse order from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive).
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 because the loop runs from `n-1` down to `0`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `i` will start at `n-1` and decrement until it reaches `0`.

4. **Initial Values**:
   - `n` is an input integer, so we need to ensure it is at least 1.
   - `i` will start at `n-1`, but since we are adjusting the initial state, we set `i` to `n-1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`**
