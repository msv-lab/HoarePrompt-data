Reasoning:

1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes a list `p` with `-1` values of length `n`.
4. It calculates the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) value for the permutation `p` by iterating backward through the array `a` and setting `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`.
5. The MEX value is updated after each assignment to ensure it remains the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p`.
6. The function prints the resulting permutation `p` for each test case.

However, there is a logical flaw in the calculation of `mex`. The variable `mex` should be updated to the minimum value found among the elements of `p` after each assignment, but it should also ensure that the value assigned to `p[i]` does not violate the condition that `mex` must be the smallest non-negative integer not present in `p`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that `mex` is always set to the next smallest non-negative integer that is not already in `p`. This can be done by maintaining a set of values that are already in `p` and updating `mex` accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = 0
        used = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] >= 0:
                p[i] = a[i]
                used.add(a[i])
            else:
                while mex in used:
                    mex += 1
                p[i] = mex
                used.add(mex)
        
        print(*p)
```

With this correction, the function ensures that each `p[i]` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `p` up to that point.

# Overall this is what the function does:
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then constructs a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each index `i`, `p[i]` equals the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p` up to that point, adjusted by `a[i]`. After constructing the permutation, it prints the elements of `p`.

Given the above explanation, the original function was incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating `mex`. However, the provided annotated program does not reflect the necessary corrections.

Correctness: **False**
