Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `i` is clearly 1. However, `v1` and `prev` are not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values. Since they are not provided, we should describe them as unknown variables.

Output: **? [v1] 1 [v1] [prev]**
