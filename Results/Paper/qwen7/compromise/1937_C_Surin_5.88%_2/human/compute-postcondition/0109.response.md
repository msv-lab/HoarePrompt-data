Output State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the final input string after all iterations, `prev` is `n-1`, `i` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The line `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all pending buffered data is written to the standard output. However, this line does not affect any variable values or change the state of any variables. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
