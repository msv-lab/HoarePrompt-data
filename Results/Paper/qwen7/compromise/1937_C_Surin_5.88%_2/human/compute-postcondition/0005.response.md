Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer that is at least 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0.**

The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `v1`. Since `n` is an input integer that is at least 1 and `kp` and `g` were initially set to `0`, these values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
