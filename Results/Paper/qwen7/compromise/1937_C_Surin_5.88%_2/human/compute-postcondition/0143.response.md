Output State: **`g` is 0, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0**.

Explanation: The initial state has `g` as 0, `v1` as `n-1`, and `v2` as `n-1`. The given code snippet only initializes `prev` to 0 without affecting any other variables or changing their values. Therefore, the values of `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and `prev` remain unchanged from their initial states.
