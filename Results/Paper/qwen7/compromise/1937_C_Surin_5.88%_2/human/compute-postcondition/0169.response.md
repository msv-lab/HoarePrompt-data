Output State: **The loop will have executed for all provided inputs, with the following conditions:**

- `g` remains 0.
- `n` is the last input integer provided, and it must be at least 4.
- `r` is the final input string received after all iterations.
- `prev` is equal to `n-1`.
- `i` is 0.
- `kp` is equal to the total number of iterations minus one.
- `v1` is equal to `n-1`.
- `v2` is equal to `n-1`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variables will reflect the final state of the last iteration, with `prev` being `n-1`, `v1` and `v2` both being `n-1`, and `i` reset to 0, while `kp` will indicate the total number of iterations performed.
