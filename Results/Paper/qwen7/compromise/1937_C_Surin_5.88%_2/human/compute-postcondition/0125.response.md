Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `g` is 0
   - `v1` is `i`
   - `v2` is `i`
   - The input string `r` has been set to `<`

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must hold true.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `v1` and `v2` are both equal to `i`, we can assume that `v1` and `v2` are essentially the same variable `i`.
   - The value of `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `g` remains 0.
   - `v1` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `v2` becomes `i + 1`.
   - The input string `r` remains `<`.

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: `g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `v2` is `i + 1`, and the input string `r` has been set to `<**.
