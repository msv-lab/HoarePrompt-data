Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the range function parameters, which involve the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will start with `i = 1` and increment `i` until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` is not specified in the loop head, but it will start from 1.
   - The value of `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - The variables `kp`, `g`, and `v1` are not used in the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` will start from 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
