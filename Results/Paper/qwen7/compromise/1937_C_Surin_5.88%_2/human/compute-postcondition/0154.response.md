Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is greater than 2 but its exact value is not specified.
- `r` is an input string, but its specific value is not provided.
- If `r` equals '>', then `prev` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prev` is not defined and would result in an error if referenced.

Given this, we need to consider two cases for `r`:

1. If `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is set to 1.
2. If `r` is not equal to '>', then `prev` is undefined and would cause an error if referenced.

Since the problem does not specify the value of `r`, we should consider the most likely scenario where `r` is equal to '>', as it is the only case where `prev` is defined.

Therefore, we assume `r` is equal to '>', so `prev` is set to 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `v1` is not defined in the initial state, so it would be a placeholder or an undefined variable. Given the lack of information about `v1`, we cannot determine its value.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **'? [v1] 2 [v1] 1'**
