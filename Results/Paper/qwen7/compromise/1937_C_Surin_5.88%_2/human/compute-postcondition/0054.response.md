Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `r` is the input string from the last iteration, `prev` is equal to `n`, and `i` is set to `n`.**

Explanation: The line `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the console. However, this line does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `r`, `prev`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states. Specifically, `n` must still be at least 2, `r` is the input string from the last iteration of the loop, `prev` is equal to `n`, and `i` is set to `n`.
