Output State: **None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. The function I is defined as a lambda function that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps it to integers. The permutation p is not yet defined and no queries have been made.**

This output state reflects that the lambda function `I` has been defined to process input, but no actual input has been provided or processed, and the permutation \( p \) remains undefined.
