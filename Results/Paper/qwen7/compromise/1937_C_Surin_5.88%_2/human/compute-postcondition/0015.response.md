Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `v2` is 1 (not relevant for the loop).
   - `r` is '<' (not relevant for the loop).

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

Given these points, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**
