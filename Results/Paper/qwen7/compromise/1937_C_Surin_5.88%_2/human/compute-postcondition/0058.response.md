Output State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the input string from the last iteration, `prev` is equal to `n`, `i` is set to `n`, `kp` is 1, `v1` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `v1 = 0` initializes `v1` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `g`, `n`, `r`, `prev`, `i`, and `kp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
