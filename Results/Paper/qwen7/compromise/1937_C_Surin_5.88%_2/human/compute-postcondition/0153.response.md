Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` is an input string.
   - If `r` equals '>', `prev` is set to 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 2) must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.
   - The values of `r` and `prev` do not change within the loop head and are not affected by the loop itself.

5. **State adjustment**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `r` remains an input string.
   - If `r` equals '>', `prev` is set to 1, but since the value of `r` does not change, `prev` remains 1 if `r` was previously set to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is an input string, and if `r` equals '>', `prev` is set to 1**.
