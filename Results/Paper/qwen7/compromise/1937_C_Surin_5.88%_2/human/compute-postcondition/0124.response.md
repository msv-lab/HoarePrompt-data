Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is 0
   - `v1` is `i`
   - `v2` is `i`
   - The input string `r` has been set to `<`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` values from 1 to `n-1`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be the value it was in the last iteration plus 1.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `i` in the last iteration, in the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `g` remains 0 as there is no indication that `g` changes within the loop.
   - `v1` and `v2` both refer to `i`, so they will also be updated to `i + 1`.
   - The input string `r` remains unchanged as there is no mention of modifying `r` within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `g` is 0, `v1` is `i + 1`, `v2` is `i + 1`, and the input string `r` has been set to `<`**
