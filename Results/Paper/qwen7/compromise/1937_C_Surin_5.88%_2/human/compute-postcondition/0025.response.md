Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `v2` is 3**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any print statements before this line are displayed immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or affected by this line of code, their previous states remain unchanged.
