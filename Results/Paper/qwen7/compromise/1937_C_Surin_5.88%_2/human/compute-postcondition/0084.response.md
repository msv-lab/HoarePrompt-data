Output State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the final input string after all iterations, `prev` is 0, `i` is `n`, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`**.

Explanation: The line `prev = 0` updates the value of `prev` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
