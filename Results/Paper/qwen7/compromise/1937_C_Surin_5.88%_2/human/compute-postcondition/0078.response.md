Output State: **`v2` is equal to `i`, `r` is the string input by the user**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the terminal or file. Since no variables are modified, the values of `v2` and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
