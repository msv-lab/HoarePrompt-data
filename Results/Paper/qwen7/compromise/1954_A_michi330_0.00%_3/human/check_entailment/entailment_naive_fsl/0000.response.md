Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `m` (the number of colors) is less than or equal to `k` (the number of parts Bob can repaint). According to the problem description, if `m` is less than or equal to `k`, Bob can always repaint the ribbon to have all parts the same color, regardless of the value of `n`. Therefore, the condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:` is incorrect for this scenario.

A correct condition should be `if m <= k:` to handle this case properly. Here is an example where the program fails:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  2 1 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  Yes
  ```

This is because with `m = 1` and `k = 1`, Bob can still repaint the entire ribbon to have all parts the same color, but the program incorrectly outputs 'Yes'.
