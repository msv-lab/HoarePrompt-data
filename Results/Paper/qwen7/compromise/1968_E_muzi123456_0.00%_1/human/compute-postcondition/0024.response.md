Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means the loop will run as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 1.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop runs until `i` is less than or equal to `n`, if `i` is 1, the loop will execute as long as `i <= n`.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - The condition `i <= n` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 2**
