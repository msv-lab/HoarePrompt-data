Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive; n is not defined**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the input is taken from the user, the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), but the value of `n` remains undefined as it is not mentioned or initialized in the given code snippet.
