Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `n` must be at least 3. Therefore, the final state of `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
