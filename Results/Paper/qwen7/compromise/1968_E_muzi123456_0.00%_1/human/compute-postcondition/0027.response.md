Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` is 2.

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.

5. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is now 3, the loop will continue as long as `3 <= n`.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state to reflect the new value of `i` and ensure that the condition for the next iteration is met.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 3**
