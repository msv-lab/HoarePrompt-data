Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`. This means `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Analyze the current state**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was decreased by 1 (though `t` is not part of the loop head).
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is currently 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `t` is decreased by 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3**
