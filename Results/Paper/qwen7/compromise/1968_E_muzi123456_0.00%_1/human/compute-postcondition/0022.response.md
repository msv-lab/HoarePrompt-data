Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This implies that `t` must be 1 because if `t` were any number other than 1, it would not satisfy the condition `t == t - 1`. For example, if `t` were 2, then `2 != 1`, which contradicts the condition.
- `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is initialized to 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

This statement will print the string `'1'` followed by a space (`end=' '`). Since no additional characters or values are being printed, the only thing printed is `'1'`.

Output: **1**
