Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive; n is not defined
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print('1', end=' ')
        print(i)
    print(' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`. Given that the loop was able to run up to the third iteration, `n` must be at least 3. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n`

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains greater than 0 and is equal to `t - 1`. The variable `n` remains as the input integer it was initialized with. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, as the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n` inclusive.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: The loop will print '1' followed by each integer from 1 to n, with each number on the same line separated by a space. After all iterations, `t` is decreased by the total number of iterations (which is `n`), `n` remains as the original input integer, and `i` will be equal to `n`.

In simpler terms, the loop will print a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`, all on the same line separated by spaces. The variable `t` will be decreased by `n`, and `i` will end up being equal to `n`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
