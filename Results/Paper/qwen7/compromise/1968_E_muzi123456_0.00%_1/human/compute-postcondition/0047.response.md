Output State: The loop will print '1' followed by each integer from 1 to n, with each number on the same line separated by a space. After all iterations, `t` is decreased by the total number of iterations (which is `n`), `n` remains as the original input integer, and `i` will be equal to `n`.

In simpler terms, the loop will print a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`, all on the same line separated by spaces. The variable `t` will be decreased by `n`, and `i` will end up being equal to `n`.
