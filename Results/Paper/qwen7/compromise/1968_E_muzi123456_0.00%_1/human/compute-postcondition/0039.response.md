Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is decreased by 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` must be 1.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n + 1):`.
   - This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute if `n > 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `t` is not part of the loop head, so its value does not change.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0, but for the loop to execute, it must be greater than 1.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 2.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` will be 2.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is decreased by 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**
