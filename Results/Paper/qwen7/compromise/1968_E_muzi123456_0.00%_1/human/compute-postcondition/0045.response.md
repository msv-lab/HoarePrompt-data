Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is decreased by 1, but the value of `t` itself is not relevant to the print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but again, the value of `n` is not needed for the print statement.
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 3.

The print statement is simply printing the value of `i`, which is given as 3.

Output: **3**
