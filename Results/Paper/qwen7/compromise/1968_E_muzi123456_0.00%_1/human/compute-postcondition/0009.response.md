Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 0 and 49, inclusive.
- `i` is explicitly defined as 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0, but its exact value is not specified and does not affect the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the value of `i`, which is explicitly given as 2.

Output: **2**
