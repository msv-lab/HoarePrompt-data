Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n`

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains greater than 0 and is equal to `t - 1`, `n` retains its original value as an input integer, and `i` will be equal to `n` since the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n`.
