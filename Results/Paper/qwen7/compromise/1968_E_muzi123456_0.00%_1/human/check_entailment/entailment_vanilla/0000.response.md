Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
3. For each test case, the function prints a series of coordinates where the first coordinate is always 1 and the second coordinate ranges from 1 to \(n\).
4. This approach does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For example, for \(n=2\), the output would be:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   ```
   The Manhattan distances are 0 and 1, so \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct but not necessarily the maximum possible set of distances for larger \(n\).

5. The examples in the problem statement show more complex arrangements that achieve a larger \(\mathcal{H}\) for larger \(n\). The provided function does not generate such arrangements.

Given the requirement to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the provided function does not meet the criteria because it only prints a simple pattern that does not necessarily maximize the set of distances.

Correctness: **False**
