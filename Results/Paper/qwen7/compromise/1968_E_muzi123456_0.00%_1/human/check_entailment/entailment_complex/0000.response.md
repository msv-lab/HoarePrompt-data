Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) which consists of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by printing \(n\) cells in a specific pattern: each row starts with '1' followed by the row index. This means for each test case, it prints:
   - Row 1: 1 1
   - Row 2: 1 2
   - Row 3: 1 3
   - ...
   - Row n: 1 n

3. Let's analyze the Manhattan distances generated by this pattern:
   - The distance between any two cells \((1, j)\) and \((1, k)\) (both in the first row) is \(|j - k|\).
   - The distance between any cell \((1, j)\) and any cell \((i, k)\) where \(i > 1\) is \(i - 1 + |j - k|\).

4. The set of all possible Manhattan distances includes:
   - All values from 0 to \(n-1\) (from the first row comparisons).
   - All values from 1 to \(n-1\) (from the comparisons involving the first row and other rows, since \(i - 1\) ranges from 1 to \(n-1\)).

5. Therefore, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all integers from 0 to \(n-1\), giving us exactly \(n\) distinct distances.

6. The annotated program correctly processes each test case and prints the required pattern of cells. The state analysis confirms that after processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are in the expected final states.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
