### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided program:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function simply checks if the input list is already sorted. It does not perform any operations to transform the list according to the problem requirements. Therefore, it cannot be used to determine if the array can be transformed into a sorted array through the allowed operations.

2. **Main Logic**: The main loop iterates over the list but does not perform the necessary digit-splitting and reinsertion operations. Instead, it calls `func_1` to check if the list is sorted, which it is not. Hence, the program always prints "NO" because `func_1` returns `False` for any unsorted list.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input: 
     ```
     3
     4
     12 3 45 67
     ```
   - The correct output should be "YES" because we can split the elements to get `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted.
   - However, the provided program does not perform the necessary splitting and reinsertion. It only checks if the array is sorted, which it is not in its initial state. Therefore, the program incorrectly outputs "NO".

Given these points, the original assessment is correct. The program does not implement the required logic to transform the array into a sorted one through the specified operations.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary digit-splitting and reinsertion operations to transform the array into a sorted one.
