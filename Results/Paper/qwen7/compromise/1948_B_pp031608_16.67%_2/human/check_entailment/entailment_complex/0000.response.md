Reasoning:
The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits**: The logic for splitting digits from a number greater than or equal to 10 into individual digits and inserting them back into the list is not implemented correctly. The current implementation does not handle the splitting and insertion process properly.

2. **Unnecessary Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called after the main loop, which is unnecessary because the goal is to determine if the array can be sorted, not to check if it is already sorted.

3. **Incorrect Conditional Check**: The condition `if not func_1(list1):` is not appropriate for the problem's requirements. The purpose is to check if the array can be made sorted through the allowed operations, not to check if it is already sorted.

4. **Missing Operations for Array Transformation**: The program does not include the necessary logic to repeatedly apply the digit-splitting operation until the array is sorted or it is determined that it cannot be sorted.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
