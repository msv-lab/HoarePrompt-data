### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the analysis further to confirm the reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation:**
   - The program attempts to split a number into its digits and insert them back into the array. However, this approach does not guarantee that the array will become sorted. For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. Splitting `45` into `[4, 5]` and inserting them results in `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is still not sorted. This shows that the operation alone is insufficient to ensure the array becomes sorted.

2. **Function `func_1` Usage:**
   - The function `func_1(lst)` checks if the array is sorted. However, it only checks once after the operations. If the operations do not make the array sorted, the program will incorrectly print 'Yes'. This means the program might fail to detect cases where the array cannot be made sorted through the allowed operations.

3. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The logic to split and insert digits is flawed and does not ensure a sorted array. The program does not guarantee that the array will become sorted even if the operations are performed. For instance, the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]` cannot be sorted using the described operations.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code

- **Initial State:**
  - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
  
- **Main Loop:**
  - The program iterates over the array elements starting from the second element (`p`).
  - It checks if `func_1(list1)` returns `False`. If so, it proceeds to check if the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is greater than 10.
  - If the condition is met, it performs the operation to split the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
  - After performing the operation, it rechecks if the array is sorted using `func_1(list1)`.

- **Sorting Check Function:**
  - The function `func_1(lst)` checks if the given list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.

### Evidence for Inaccuracy

- **Example 1:**
  - Consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
  - Splitting `45` into `[4, 5]` and inserting them results in `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is still not sorted.
  - The program will incorrectly print 'Yes' because it only checks once after the operation.

- **Example 2:**
  - Consider the array `[2, 10]`.
  - Splitting `10` into `[1, 0]` and inserting them results in `[2, 1, 0]`, which is sorted.
  - The program will correctly print 'Yes'.

- **Example 3:**
  - Consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
  - No sequence of operations can make this array sorted.
  - The program will incorrectly print 'Yes' because it only checks once after the operation.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified and the detailed evaluation, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to transform the array into a sorted one. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
