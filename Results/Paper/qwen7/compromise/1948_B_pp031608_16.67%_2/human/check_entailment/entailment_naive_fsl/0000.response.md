Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the splitting of numbers into their individual digits and reinserting them in the array. Instead, it attempts to sort the array using a separate function `func_1`, which simply checks if the array is already sorted.

Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
```

The correct output should be "YES" because we can split the elements to get `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` which is sorted.

However, the provided program does not perform the necessary splitting and reinsertion of digits. It only checks if the array is sorted, which it is not in its initial state. Therefore, the program incorrectly outputs "NO".

To fix this, the program needs to include logic to split the numbers and reinsert the digits as described in the problem statement.
