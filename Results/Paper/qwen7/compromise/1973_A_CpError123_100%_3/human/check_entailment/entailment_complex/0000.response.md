Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the maximum number of draws that could have occurred given the scores of three players.
- The annotated program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is even, which is necessary for the scores to be achievable through the described game rules.
- If the sum is odd, the program correctly prints \(-1\) because an odd sum cannot be achieved by the described scoring system.
- The program then calculates \(x\) as half the sum of the scores (rounded down) and \(y\) as the sum of the first two scores. It prints the minimum of these two values.
- This approach is correct because:
  - The maximum number of draws can be calculated by considering the total points and how they can be distributed among wins and draws.
  - By calculating \(x\) as half the sum of the scores, we account for the fact that each draw contributes 2 points in total (1 point per player).
  - The sum of the first two scores (\(y\)) gives the maximum possible points from wins, since each win contributes 2 points.
- The logic of taking the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\) ensures that the solution considers both the total points available and the points that could have come from wins, thus maximizing the number of draws while ensuring the scores are achievable.

Correctness: **True**
