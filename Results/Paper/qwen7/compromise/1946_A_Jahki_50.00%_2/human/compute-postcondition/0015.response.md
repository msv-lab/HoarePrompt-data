Output State: **`case` is a string input from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer less than or equal to 10000, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a`, and `ma` is equal to `num2 / 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num2 / 2` to `ma`. Since `num2` is an odd number, dividing it by 2 results in a non-integer value, which is converted to an integer due to the `int()` function. Therefore, `ma` is set to the integer part of `num2 / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
