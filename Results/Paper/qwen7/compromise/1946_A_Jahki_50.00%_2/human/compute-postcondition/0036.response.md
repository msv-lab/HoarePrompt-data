Output State: `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is the number of iterations it took for `new_median` to become greater than `median`, `b` is a sorted list of `a`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment the value at the middle index of the sorted list `b` until the new median becomes greater than the original median. Since the loop stops when `new_median > median`, the final value of `new_median` will be the highest value in the list `b`. The variable `op` will hold the total number of iterations it took for this condition to be met. The lists `a` and `b` will remain sorted, and their values will reflect the increments made during the loop.
