Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained by sorting `a`, `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 // 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `num2 // 2` to `ma`, which means `ma` is the integer division of `num2` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
