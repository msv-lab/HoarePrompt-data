Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 0
- `students` is 1
- `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`
- `op` is the number of iterations it took for `new_median` to become greater than `median`
- `b` is a sorted list of `a`

The loop increments the value at the middle index of the sorted list `b` until `new_median` becomes greater than `median`. Since `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, it will eventually become greater than `median` after a certain number of iterations. The variable `op` will store the number of iterations required for this condition to be met.

Given that `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, and the loop increments the middle value until it exceeds `median`, the number of iterations (`op`) will be the position of the last element in the list `b` (since the list is sorted, the maximum value will be at the end).

Therefore, `op` will be the length of the list `b` minus 1 (because the list is 0-indexed).

Output: **op (where op is the length of the list b minus 1)**
