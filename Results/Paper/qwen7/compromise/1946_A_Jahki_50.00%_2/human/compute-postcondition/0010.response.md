Output State: **`case` is a string input from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer less than or equal to 10000, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by splitting the string `case` into substrings using whitespace as the delimiter, converting each substring that represents a digit into an integer, and including only those integers in the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `num2`, and `op`) remain unchanged.
