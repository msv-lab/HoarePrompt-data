Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes input through a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the length of the array `a`, and an array `a` of `n` integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. The function returns the result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a number of elements (test cases `t`), the size of an array (`n`), and the array itself (`a`). It processes each test case according to specified rules and returns the results accordingly.
