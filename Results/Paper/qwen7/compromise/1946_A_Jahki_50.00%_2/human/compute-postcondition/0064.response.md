Output State: **`b` is sorted, `ma` is incremented by 1, `op` is increased by 2, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma-2]`, `b[ma]` is increased by 2, `new_median` is now equal to `b[ma-1]`**

Explanation: The code `b[ma] += 1` increments the value of `b[ma]` by 1. Given that `new_median` was previously equal to `b[ma-1]`, after incrementing `b[ma]`, `new_median` will now be equal to `b[ma-1]`. Since `ma` was incremented before this line, `ma-1` now refers to the element at the position previously referred to as `ma-2`. Therefore, `new_median` is updated to `b[ma-2]` before the increment and then changes to `b[ma-1]` after the increment. All other variables remain unchanged.
