Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `new_median <= median`. The variables involved in this condition are `new_median` and `median`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `new_median` is equal to `median`.
   - `median` is defined as `b[ma]`, where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 / 2`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`. Since `new_median` is initially equal to `median`, the loop will not execute at all unless `new_median` is modified.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - To make the loop execute the first time, `new_median` must be made strictly less than `median`. This means we need to change the value of `new_median` to something less than `median`.

Given the initial state:
- `case` is a string input from the user.
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- `i` is 0.
- `num2` is an input integer less than or equal to 10000.
- `op` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer.
- `b` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a`.
- `median` is `b[ma]` where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 / 2`.
- `new_median` is equal to `median`.

To make the loop execute the first time, we need to adjust `new_median` to be less than `median`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is 0, students is 2 less than its initial value and students currently must be greater or equal to 1, `new_median` must be less than `median`**
