The only variable in the loop head is `new_median`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `new_median`. If `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `new_median` must be greater than `median`.

State: **`b` is sorted in ascending order; `new_median` must be greater than `median`**
