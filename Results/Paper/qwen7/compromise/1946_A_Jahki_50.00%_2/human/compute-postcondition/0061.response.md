Output State: **`b` is sorted, `ma` is incremented by 1, `op` is increased by 2, `new_median` is equal to the value at index `ma-1` of list `b` and `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`, `b[ma]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b`. Since `b` was already sorted initially, sorting it again does not change its order. However, the fact that `b` is sorted remains true. The operations on `ma`, `op`, `new_median`, and `b[ma]` are unaffected by the sorting operation, so their states remain as described. The only change is that `op` is increased by 1 (from the initial state) to become `op` is increased by 2.
