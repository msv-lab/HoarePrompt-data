Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma] + 1`, `op` is 2, `b` is a sorted list of `b`, and `median` must be greater than `b[ma] + 1**.

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b`. Since `b` was already sorted, sorting it again does not change its order. Therefore, the sorted nature of `b` remains the same as before. All other variables (`total`, `students`, `new_median`, `op`, and `median`) remain unchanged.
