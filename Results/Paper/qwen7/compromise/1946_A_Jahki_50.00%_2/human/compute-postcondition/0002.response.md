Output State: **`num` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer.**

The code `num2 = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `num2`. The initial conditions for `num` and `t` remain unchanged, and `i` is reset to 0.
