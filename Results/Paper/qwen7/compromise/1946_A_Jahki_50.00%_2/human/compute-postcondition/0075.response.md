Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is the same as the initial or previous state, `case` is updated to the new input string.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `op`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The initial conditions and values of the variables are preserved except for `op`, which is now explicitly set to 0.
