Output State: **`b` is sorted, `ma` is incremented by 1, `op` is increased by 3, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma-1]`**

Explanation: The variable `op` was initially increased by 2, and the code `op += 1` increments `op` by 1 more, making `op` increase by a total of 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
