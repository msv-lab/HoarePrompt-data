Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer input from the user, otherwise `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is the number of iterations it took for `new_median` to become greater than `median`, and `b` is a sorted list of `a`.**

The code `case = input()` assigns the value of the user's input (a string) to the variable `case`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
