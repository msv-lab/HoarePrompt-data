Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 1, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is 0, and `b` is a sorted list of `a`.**

Explanation: The line `op = 0` initializes the variable `op` to 0. This does not affect any other variables, so their states remain unchanged.
