Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input for multiple test cases, reading the number of test cases (`num`) and then processing each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Array Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the array (`num2`) exceeds 10,000. If it does, it prints 1 and 16668 and breaks. However, this check seems unnecessary and could be removed because the problem guarantees that the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, which means no test case will have `num2 > 10,000`.

3. **Sorting and Median Calculation**: The program sorts the array and calculates the median correctly. It handles both even and odd lengths of the array appropriately.

4. **Incrementing Elements**: The program increments the middle elements of the sorted array until the new median exceeds the original median. This logic is correct and ensures that the median increases with the minimum number of operations.

5. **Output**: The program prints the number of operations required for each test case, which is the correct output format.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
