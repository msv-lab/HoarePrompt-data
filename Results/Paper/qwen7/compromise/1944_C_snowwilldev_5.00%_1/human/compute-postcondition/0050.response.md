Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 5, `cnt[a[i]]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[a[i]]` by 1. However, the value of `a[i]` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `cnt[a[i]]`. But we know that before the increment, `cnt[a[i]]` was 0 (assuming it was initialized to 0), so after the increment, `cnt[a[i]]` becomes 1. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that `N` must be greater than 5 is still valid but does not affect the variables mentioned in the code snippet.
