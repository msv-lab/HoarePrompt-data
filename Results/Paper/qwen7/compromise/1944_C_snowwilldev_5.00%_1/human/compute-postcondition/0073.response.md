Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `tc` is 4**

Explanation: The variable `t` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `i` and `tc` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet. The condition that `N` must be greater than `i_prev + 1` remains valid as no changes were made to `N` or `i_prev`.
