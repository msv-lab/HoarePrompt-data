Output State: **`tc` is 5, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with a default factory function `int`. This means that `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is associated with an integer value initialized to 0. The values of `tc`, `N`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
