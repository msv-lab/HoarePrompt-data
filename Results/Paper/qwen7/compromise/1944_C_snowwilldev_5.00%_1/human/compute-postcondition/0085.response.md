Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `N` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < N`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `N` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `N` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `tc` is 5 (this variable is not involved in the loop head).
- `N` is an input integer (we need to ensure it is greater than 0).
- `a` is a list of integers (not involved in the loop head).
- `cnt` is a dictionary with default value 0 (not involved in the loop head).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `N` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`N` must be greater than 0**
