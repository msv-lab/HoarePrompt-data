Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 3
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`
- `tc` is 4
- If `cnt[i]` equals 1, then these values remain unchanged.

We need to determine the value of `i` when the `print(i)` statement is executed. 

From the information given, `i` is defined as `i_prev + 1`. Since `i_prev` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, the problem does not require us to know the exact value of `i_prev` to determine what will be printed. We only need to know that `i` is `i_prev + 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `i`, which is `i_prev + 1`.

Output: **i_prev + 1**
