Postcondition: `t` is 1, `i` is less than `N`, `tc` is 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `cnt` is a defaultdict where each value is incremented based on the count of each element in the list `a` up to index `N-1` and the current value of `cnt[i]` is 1, and either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or the current value of `cnt[i]` is 0.
