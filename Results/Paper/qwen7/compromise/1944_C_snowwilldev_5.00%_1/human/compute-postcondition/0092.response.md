Output State: The dictionary `cnt` will contain the count of each integer present in the list `a` after all iterations of the loop. The key for each entry in `cnt` will be an integer from the list `a`, and the value will be the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`.

Since the loop runs `N` times and increments `cnt[a[i]]` by 1 for each iteration, where `i` ranges from 0 to `N-1`, the final state of `cnt` will reflect the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. All other variables (`tc`, `N`, and `a`) will retain their values from the initial state, with `tc` remaining unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
