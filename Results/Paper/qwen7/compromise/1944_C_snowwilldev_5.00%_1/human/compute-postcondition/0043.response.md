Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 3, `N` is an input integer, `tc` must be 4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int using `map`, and then creates a list `a` from these integers. The initial values of `t`, `i`, `N`, and `tc` remain unchanged.
