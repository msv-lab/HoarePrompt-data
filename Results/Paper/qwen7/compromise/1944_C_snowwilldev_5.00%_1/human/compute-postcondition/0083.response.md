Output State: **`tc` is 5, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. The original values of `tc` and `N` remain unchanged. The new variable `a` is created and assigned a list of integers based on the input.
