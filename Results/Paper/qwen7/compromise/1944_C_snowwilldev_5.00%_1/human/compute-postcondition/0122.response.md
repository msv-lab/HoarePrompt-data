Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `tc` is now equal to the total number of test cases. Since the initial state of `tc` is determined by `int(input())`, and the loop runs until `tc` reaches this value, the final value of `tc` will be the total number of test cases. The variable `i` will be equal to `N` (the size of the array `a`) after the last iteration of the inner loop, as the loop increments `i` until it reaches `N`. The variable `t` will be the count of unique elements in the array `a` that appear exactly once, and the variable `cnt` will be a `defaultdict` containing the count of each integer present in the list `a`. No further elements in `a` will cause the inner loop to break, so `i` will reach `N`.

In summary, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `tc` is the total number of test cases, `i` is `N`, `t` is the count of unique elements that appear exactly once in the array `a`, and `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with the count of each integer in `a`.
