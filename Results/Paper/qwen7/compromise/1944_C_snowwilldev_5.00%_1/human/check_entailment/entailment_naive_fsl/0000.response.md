Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and calculate the MEX of the array `c`. According to the problem description, Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`, and Alice appends the chosen element to `c` while deleting it from `a`, whereas Bob only deletes the chosen element from `a`. However, the program does not simulate these turns correctly. Instead, it counts the occurrences of each element in `a` and prints the first index `i` for which `cnt[i] == 0` or `cnt[i] == 1`. This approach does not reflect the game's turns and the optimal strategy for both players.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
2
1
0
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
1
1
0
```

This is incorrect because it does not simulate the game's turns properly. For instance, in the first test case, the correct sequence of moves should result in `c = [1, 0]`, which has an MEX of 2, not 1.
