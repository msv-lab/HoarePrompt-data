Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `result` is a list containing integers calculated based on the input values of `x` and `y` for each iteration of the loop.

However, the specific calculation for the `result` list is not provided in the initial state. Without knowing the exact formula or logic used to populate the `result` list, we cannot determine the exact contents of `result`.

Given this, the print statement will join the elements of the `result` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Since we do not know the exact values in `result`, we can only describe it in general terms.

Output: **a list of integers from the `result` list, each on a new line**
