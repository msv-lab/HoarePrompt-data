### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x = x * 1` correctly calculates the space required for 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y = y * 4` correctly calculates the space required for 2x2 icons since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The calculation for `screen_require_for_y` is correct. It divides the number of 2x2 icons by 2 and rounds up if there's an odd number of them.

4. **Remaining Cells**:
   - The calculation for `remaining_cells` is correct. It subtracts the space occupied by 2x2 icons from the total available cells (15 per screen).

5. **Space Check**:
   - The check `if space_x <= remaining_cells:` ensures that if there's enough space left after placing all 2x2 icons, the remaining 1x1 icons can fit without needing additional screens.

6. **Extra Space Calculation**:
   - If there's not enough space left, the program correctly calculates how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. However, there is a mistake in this part:
     - The current logic checks if `space_x % 15 == 0` to determine if no additional screens are needed, which is incorrect. Instead, it should calculate the exact number of additional screens needed based on the remaining cells.

### Corrected Logic for Extra Screens:
- The correct way to calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons would be:
  ```python
  extra_screen = (space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + (1 if (space_x - remaining_cells) % 15 != 0 else 0)
  ```

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct but has a small logical error in calculating the number of extra screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. Therefore, the program is **not fully correct**.

### Correctness:
**False**
