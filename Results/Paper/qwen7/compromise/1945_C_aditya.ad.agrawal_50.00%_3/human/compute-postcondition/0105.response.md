Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the elements of `arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `arr` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is the second element of `arr`.
   - `pos` is 2.
   - `o_l` is either 0 or 1 more than its original value.
   - `o_r` is either 0 or 1 less than its original value.
   - `z_l` is 1 more than its original value if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value.
   - `ans` is 2.
   - `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`.
   - The condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is satisfied.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   Since `i` was the second element of `arr` in the previous iteration, it will now be the third element of `arr` in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the Other Variables:**
   - `pos` will be updated to reflect the new position of `i` in `arr`. If `i` was the second element, the next `i` will be the third element, so `pos` will be 3.
   - `o_l`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `ans`, `b_d`, and the condition must be adjusted based on the new value of `i`.

6. **Update the States:**
   - `i` will be the third element of `arr`.
   - `pos` will be 3.
   - `o_l`, `o_r`, `z_l` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `ans` remains 2.
   - `b_d` remains the same since it is dependent on `n` and `pos`, and `pos` is changing but not `n`.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `o_l` is either 0 or 1 more than its original value, `o_r` is either 0 or 1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 1 more than its original value if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value, `ans` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`, and the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is satisfied.**
