Output State: **`i` is the first element of `arr`, `pos` is 2, `o_l` is 0 more than its original value, `o_r` is 1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 0 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value, `ans` is 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`. Since `pos` is initially 2, `ans` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
