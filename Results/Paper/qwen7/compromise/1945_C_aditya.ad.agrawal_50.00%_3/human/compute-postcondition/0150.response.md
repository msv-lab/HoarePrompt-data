Output State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, `z_r` is 0, `o_l` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` is 1, `b_d` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b_d` to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. Given that `pos` is 1, the exact value of `b_d` depends on the value of `n`. However, since `n` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact numerical value. But we know that `b_d` is now equal to `abs(n / 2 - 1)`. Since the condition `b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)` still holds true, `b_d` must be 0, which means `abs(n / 2 - 1)` equals 0, implying `n` must be 2. Therefore, `b_d` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
