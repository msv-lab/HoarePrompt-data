Output State: **`pos` is 2, `i` will be the fifth element of `arr`, `b_d` remains the absolute value of `n / 2 - 1`, `o_r` remains as it was, `z_r` remains as it was, `o_r` remains as it was, `z_l` remains as it was, `o_l` remains as it was, `ans` remains as it was.**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables (`i`, `b_d`, `o_r`, `z_r`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `ans`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
