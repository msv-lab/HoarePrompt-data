Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers converted from `input_string`, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `o_l` is the total count of 1s in `arr`, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the total count of 0s in `arr`, `ans` is the position that minimizes the distance to `n/2` while satisfying the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is the minimum absolute difference between `n/2` and any position that meets the conditions, `z_r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `input_string` is the input read from the user.**

Explanation: The code reads a string from the user (`input_string`) and converts each character in the string to an integer, storing these integers in the list `arr`. The other variables (`pos`, `o_l`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `ans`, `b_d`, `z_r`, `n`, and `input_string`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
