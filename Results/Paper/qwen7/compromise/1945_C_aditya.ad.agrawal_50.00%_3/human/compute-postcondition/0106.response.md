Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. The variable `i` takes on the value of each element in `arr` during each iteration.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is the second element of `arr`.
   - `pos` is 2.
   - `o_l` is either 0 or 1 more than its original value.
   - `o_r` is either 0 or 1 less than its original value.
   - `z_l` is 1 more than its original value if `i` equals 0, otherwise it retains its original value.
   - `ans` is 2.
   - `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`.
   - The condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is satisfied.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is currently the second element of `arr`, the next value of `i` would be the third element of `arr`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will change to the third element of `arr`.
   - `pos` will increment by 1, making it 3.
   - `o_l` and `o_r` can either remain the same or change by 1, but their exact values depend on the new value of `i`.
   - `z_l` will be 1 more than its original value if `i` equals 0, otherwise it retains its original value.
   - `ans` remains 2.
   - `b_d` remains the same as it is based on `n` and `pos`, which does not change within the loop head.
   - The condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` needs to be checked again with the updated values of `o_r` and `z_l`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `o_l` is either 0 or 1 more than its original value, `o_r` is either 0 or 1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 1 more than its original value if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value, `ans` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`, and the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is satisfied.**
