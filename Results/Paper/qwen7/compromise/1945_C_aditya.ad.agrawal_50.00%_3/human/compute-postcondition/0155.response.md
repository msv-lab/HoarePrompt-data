Output State: **`i` is the fourth element of `arr`; `pos` is 1; `z_l` is increased by 1.**

The code `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `i` and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still the fourth element of `arr`, `pos` is still 1, and `z_l` has been increased by 1.
