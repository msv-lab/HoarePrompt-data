Output State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 4, `o_l` is 0 more than its original value, `o_r` is 1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 0 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value, `ans` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`**

Explanation: The code `pos += 1` increments the value of `pos` by 1. Initially, `pos` was set to 3, so after executing this line, `pos` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
