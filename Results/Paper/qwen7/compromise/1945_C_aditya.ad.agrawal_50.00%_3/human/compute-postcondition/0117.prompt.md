Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `input_string` is a string read from input, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is the absolute value of `n / 2`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the total count of 0s and 1s (`(z_r + o_r) / 2`), then `b_d` is equal to `dist`. Otherwise, `b_d` is 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the first element of `arr`, `pos` is 2, `o_l` is 0 more than its original value, `o_r` is 1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 0 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value, `ans` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 2, `o_l` is either 0 or 1 more than its original value, `o_r` is either 0 or 1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 1 more than its original value if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value, `ans` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`, and the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is assigned to `ans`, `o_l` is either 1 or 2 more than its original value, `o_r` is either 0 or -1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 2 more than its original value if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value, `ans` is `pos`, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - ans`, and the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is satisfied.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
