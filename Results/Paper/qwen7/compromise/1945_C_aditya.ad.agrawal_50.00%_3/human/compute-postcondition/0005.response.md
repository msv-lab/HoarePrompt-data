Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting each character of `input_string` to its corresponding integer value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code counts the number of 0s in the list `arr` and assigns this count to the variable `z`. The values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
