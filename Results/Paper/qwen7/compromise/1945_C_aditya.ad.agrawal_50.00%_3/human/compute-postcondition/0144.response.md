Output State: **`o_l` is 1, `i` is now the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `o_r -= 1` decrements the value of `o_r` by 1. Given the initial state where `o_l` is 2, after executing the code, `o_l` becomes 1. All other variables (`i`, `pos`, and the condition about `i`) remain unchanged.
