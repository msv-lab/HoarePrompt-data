Output State: **`o_l` is 2, `i` is now the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, and `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The variable `o_l` is incremented by 1, making its new value 2. The values of `i` and `pos` remain unchanged, with `i` still being the second element of `arr` and `pos` still being 1. The condition that `i` is not equal to 0 is also preserved.
