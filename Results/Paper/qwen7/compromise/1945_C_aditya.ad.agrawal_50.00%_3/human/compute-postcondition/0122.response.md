The `input()` function reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `input_string`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `pos`, `o_l`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `ans`, `b_d`, `z_r`, and `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be non-zero, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `o_l` is the total count of 1s in `arr`, `o_r` is 0, `z_l` is the total count of 0s in `arr`, `ans` is the position that minimizes the distance to `n/2` while satisfying the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, `b_d` is the minimum absolute difference between `n/2` and any position that meets the conditions, `z_r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `input_string` is the input read from the user.**
