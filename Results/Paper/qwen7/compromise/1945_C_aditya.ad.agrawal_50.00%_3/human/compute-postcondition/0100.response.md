Postcondition: `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 4, `o_l` is either 0 or 1 more than its original value, `o_r` is either 0 or 1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 1 more than its original value if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value, `ans` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`.
