Output State: **`pos` is 2, `i` will be the fifth element of `arr`, `b_d` remains the absolute value of `n / 2 - 1`, `o_r` remains as it was, `z_r` is decreased by 1, `o_l` remains as it was, `ans` remains as it was.**

Explanation: The code `z_r -= 1` decreases the value of `z_r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
