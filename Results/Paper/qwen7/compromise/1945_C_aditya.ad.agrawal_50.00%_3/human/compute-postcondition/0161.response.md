Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is the fourth element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, if `i` equals 0, then `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans = pos` assigns the value of `pos` (which is 1) to `ans`. No other changes are made to the variables `i`, `pos`, `z_r`, or `o_r`. Therefore, `i` remains the fourth element of `arr`, `pos` remains 1, and the conditions regarding `z_r` and `o_r` remain unchanged.
