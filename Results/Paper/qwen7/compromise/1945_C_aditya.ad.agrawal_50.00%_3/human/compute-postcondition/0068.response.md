Output State: **`input_string` is a string read from input, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`.**

Explanation: The line `z_r = z` assigns the value of `z` (which is the count of 0s in `arr`) to `z_r`. The values of `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, and the counts themselves remain unchanged.
