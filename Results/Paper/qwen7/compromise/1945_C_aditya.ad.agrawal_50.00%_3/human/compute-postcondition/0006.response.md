Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting each character of `input_string` to its corresponding integer value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`**.

Explanation: The code `o = arr.count(1)` assigns to `o` the count of 1s in the list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states.
