Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and their meanings:

- `arr`: A non-empty list of integers.
- `i`: The last element of `arr`.
- `pos`: The length of `arr`.
- `z_r`: The total count of 0s in `arr` minus the count of 0s encountered up to the last element.
- `o_r`: The total count of 1s in `arr` minus the count of 1s encountered up to the last element.
- `z_l`: The count of 0s encountered up to the last element.
- `o_l`: The count of 1s encountered up to the last element.
- `b_d`: 30001 if no position satisfies the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))`, otherwise it is the absolute difference between `n / 2` and the position where the condition is met.
- `ans`: The position where the condition is met if such a position exists, otherwise it remains 0.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`.

To determine what `ans` is, we need to consider the condition under which `ans` is set to a non-zero value. The condition is:

\[ o_r \geq \frac{z_r + o_r}{2} \text{ and } z_l \geq \frac{z_l + o_l}{2} \text{ and } b_d > |n / 2 - pos| \]

Given the complexity of this condition and the fact that `b_d` is initially set to 30001, it implies that unless there is a specific position in the list that meets these criteria, `b_d` will remain 30001, and thus `ans` will remain 0.

Therefore, without any additional information about the contents of `arr` that would allow us to determine a specific position meeting the condition, we can conclude that `ans` will be 0.

Output: **0**
