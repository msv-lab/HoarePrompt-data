Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the fifth element of `arr`, `pos` is 5, `z_r` is 4, `o_r` are updated accordingly, `z_l` is 6, `o_l` are updated accordingly, `b_d` is 1, and `ans` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `z_r -= 1` decrements the value of `z_r` by 1. Since `z_r` was previously 5, it is now 4. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
