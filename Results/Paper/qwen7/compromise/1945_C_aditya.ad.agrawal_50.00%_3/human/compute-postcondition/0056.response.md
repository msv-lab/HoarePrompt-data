Postcondition: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the fifth element of `arr`, `pos` is 5, `z_r` is either 4 or one less than its original value, `o_r` is updated accordingly, `z_l` is 6, `o_l` are updated accordingly, `b_d` is 3, and `ans` is 5 if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true. Otherwise, `ans` remains 4 if `i` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains 3.
