Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `sum` is 156.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 6.
   - `t` is greater than 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The first argument `1` is a constant integer.
   - The second argument `n - j + 1`: Since `j` is 2, this becomes `n - 2 + 1 = n - 1`.
     - We know `n` must be at least 6, so `n - 1` will be at least 5.
   - The third argument `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range from 1 to `n` inclusive into separate arguments. For example, if `n` is 6, it would be `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.

4. **Combining the Results:**
   - The print statement will output the sequence `1, n - 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., n`.

Given the constraints, let's assume the minimum value for `n` (which is 6) for the most precise description:

Output: **1, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6**
