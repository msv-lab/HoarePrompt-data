Output State: The value of `sum` is 156, `i` is 3, `j` is 6, `n` is at least 6, and `t` is greater than 0.

Based on the provided information, the loop has already executed for 3 iterations with `i` being 3, `j` being 3, and `n` being at least 6. The value of `sum` remains 156 as no additional contributions have been added to it after the first 3 iterations. Since the loop has completed its execution, the final state of the variables is as described. The value of `i` does not change within the loop body, so it remains 3. The value of `j` reaches 6, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `n` must be at least 6, and `t` remains greater than 0, as there is no indication that it would change within the loop.
