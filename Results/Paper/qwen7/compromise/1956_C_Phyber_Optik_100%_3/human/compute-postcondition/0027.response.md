Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, and sum is 8**.

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` by adding the value of `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. Given `i` is initially 2, the expression evaluates to `(2 * 2 - 1 * 1) * 2 = (4 - 1) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6`. So, `sum` is updated to `sum + 6`. Assuming `sum` was initially 0 (since it's not mentioned otherwise), the new value of `sum` is `0 + 6 = 6`. After this, `i` is incremented to 3 (though incrementing `i` itself is not explicitly shown in the code, it is implied by the problem context). The condition `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
