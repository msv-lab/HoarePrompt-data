Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. Given the range `range(2, n + 1)`, the loop will execute for each value of `i` starting from 2 up to but not including `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be at least 2

4. **Next iteration analysis**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, `n + 1` must be greater than 3, meaning `n` must be at least 4.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 4.
   - `n` must remain at least 4 to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be at least 4**
