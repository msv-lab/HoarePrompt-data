Output State: `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is `n + 1`, `sum` is 20.

To understand this, let's break it down:
- The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n`. After 3 iterations, `i` is 4.
- The loop increments `i` by 1 each time, so after all iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`.
- The value of `sum` after 3 iterations is 20. Each iteration updates `sum` based on the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. Since the loop continues until `i` reaches `n + 1`, the final value of `sum` will be the result of the loop's execution up to `i = n + 1`.

Therefore, after all iterations, `t` remains at least 1, `n` must be greater than 4 (since the loop runs until `i` reaches `n + 1`), `i` is `n + 1`, and `sum` is 20.
