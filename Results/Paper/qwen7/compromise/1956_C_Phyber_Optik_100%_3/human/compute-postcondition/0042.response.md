Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 6.
   - `n` must be at least 6.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `sum` is 140 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - The first argument to `print` is `1`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Since `n` must be at least 6 and `j` is 3, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 6. Therefore, `n - j + 1 = 6 - 3 + 1 = 4`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which expands to the range from 1 to `n` inclusive. If `n` is 6, then `range(1, n + 1)` becomes `range(1, 7)`, which translates to the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Combining all these, the print statement will output `1 4 1 2 3 4 5 6`.

Output: **1 4 1 2 3 4 5 6**
