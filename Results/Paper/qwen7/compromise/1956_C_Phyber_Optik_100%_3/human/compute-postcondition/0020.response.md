Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is defined as `k + 2`
- `n` must be the same as before (though the value of `n` is not explicitly stated, it is assumed to be known from the context)

Let's break down the `print` statement:

```python
print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

1. The first argument is `1`.
2. The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Since `j = k + 2`, this becomes `n - (k + 2) + 1 = n - k - 1`.
3. The third argument uses the `*range(1, n + 1)` syntax, which unpacks the range object into individual arguments. This will print all integers from `1` to `n` inclusive.

Given these points, the output will be:

Output: **1, n - k - 1, 1, 2, ..., n**
