Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. The integer t is between 1 and 500 inclusive, and the integer n is between 1 and 500 inclusive. Additionally, the sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵. For each test case, the function performs some unspecified operations and returns results based on the given constraints.**
