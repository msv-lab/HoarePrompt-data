Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `j` is defined as `k + 2`.
   - `n` is mentioned to be the same as before, but no explicit value is given for `n`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`.

To determine the output, we need to express the values of `n - j + 1` and the range in terms of the given information.

- Since `j = k + 2`, we can substitute this into the expression `n - j + 1`:
  \[
  n - j + 1 = n - (k + 2) + 1 = n - k - 1
  \]

- The `*range(1, n + 1)` part will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- The number `2`
- The value `n - k - 1`
- All integers from `1` to `n` inclusive

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **2, n - k - 1, 1, 2, ..., n**
