Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is `n + 1`, `sum` is 20.

To understand this, let's break down the loop and its effect on the `sum` variable. The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = n`, and in each iteration, it updates `sum` as follows:

\[ \text{sum} += (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i \]

Simplifying the expression inside the loop:

\[ i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1 \]

So the update to `sum` in each iteration becomes:

\[ \text{sum} += (2i - 1) \times i = 2i^2 - i \]

Summing these up from `i = 2` to `i = n`:

\[ \text{sum} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \]

This can be simplified further, but for our purposes, we know that after 3 iterations, `i` is 4 and `sum` is 20. Since the loop continues until `i` reaches `n + 1`, the final value of `i` will be `n + 1`. Given that the loop has completed all its iterations, `n` must be greater than 4, and the final value of `sum` will be the result of the loop's execution up to `i = n + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: 

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is k + 1, `n` must be the same as before

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `k + 2`, `n` must be the same as before




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
