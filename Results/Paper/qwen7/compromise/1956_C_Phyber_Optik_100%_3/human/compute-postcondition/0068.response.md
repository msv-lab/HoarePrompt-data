Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `sum` is 156, `i` is 3, `j` is 6, `n` is at least 6, and `t` is greater than 0. The loop has printed the sum and `n + n` for each iteration, and for each value of `j` from 1 to `n`, it has printed two lines with specific patterns.
