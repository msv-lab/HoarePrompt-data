Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 2 (as per the range function `range(2, n + 1)`).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `n` must be at least 2 because the loop starts from `i = 2` and goes up to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `t` is mentioned in the problem statement but it is not part of the loop head. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `sum` is also mentioned but it is not part of the loop head either. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to start executing.
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 2 as per the loop definition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be at least 2 and `i` is 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2**
