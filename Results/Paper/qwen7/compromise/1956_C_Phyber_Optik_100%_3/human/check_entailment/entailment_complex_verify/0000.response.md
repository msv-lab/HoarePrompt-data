### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `sum` to 1.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `n` and adds a term to `sum` based on the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`.
   - This part of the code is incorrect because the formula does not relate to the operations described in the problem. The formula used here is not relevant to maximizing the sum of the matrix elements through row or column permutations.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints `sum` and `2n`.
   - It then prints `2n` lines, each containing a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`. These lines are printed twice, once for a Type 1 operation and once for a Type 2 operation.

4. **Operations:**
   - The operations printed are not actual permutations of the matrix rows or columns. They simply print sequences of numbers from 1 to `n`, which do not represent any meaningful permutation.

Given these observations, the program does not perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix elements. Instead, it prints a fixed sum and performs no actual operations, which contradicts the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the problem description and is therefore incorrect.

**Final: False**
