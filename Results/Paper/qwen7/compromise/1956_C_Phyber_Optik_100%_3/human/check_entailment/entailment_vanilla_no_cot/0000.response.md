Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix as per the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the sum using a formula `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`, which is not relevant to the problem. This formula seems to be derived from some other context and does not contribute to the correct solution for the given problem.

2. **Operation Implementation**: The program prints `n + n` operations for each test case, but these operations do not maximize the sum of the matrix. The operations printed are of the form:
   - Type 1: Setting `a_{n-j+1, n} := 1, 2, ..., n`
   - Type 2: Setting `a_{n-j+1, n} := 1, 2, ..., n`

   These operations do not align with the goal of maximizing the sum of the matrix. Instead, the correct approach involves setting specific rows and columns to permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` to achieve the maximum possible sum.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
- Set the first row to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- For each subsequent row, set it to a permutation that maximizes the sum, and similarly for columns.
- Ensure that the total number of operations does not exceed `2n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        # Print the maximum sum and the number of operations
        print(n * n, 2 * n)
        
        # Perform the operations
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, *range(1, n + 1))  # Type 1 operation on row i
            print(2, i, *range(1, n + 1))  # Type 2 operation on column i

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that each row and each column is set to a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`, achieving the maximum possible sum of the matrix, which is \( n^2 \), and uses exactly `2n` operations.
