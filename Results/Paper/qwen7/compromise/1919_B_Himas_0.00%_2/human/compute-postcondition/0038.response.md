Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
   - `e` is a non-empty string.
   - `q` is the first character of `e`.
   - If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `q` is not '+' and `M` is 1.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `e` using the variable `q`.

3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the new state of the variables involved in the loop head. These variables are `q` and `e`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating through each character of `e`, in the next iteration, `q` will be the next character in the string `e`.
   - The string `e` remains the same unless modified outside the loop, but since no such modification is mentioned, `e` stays the same.
   - After the first character is processed (which sets `q` to the first character), the next character will be processed in the next iteration.

5. **New State**:
   - `e` remains a non-empty string.
   - `q` will be the second character of `e` (since it was the first character in the previous iteration).

6. **Postconditions for Next Iteration**:
   - If the new `q` is '+', then `P` will be 1.
   - Otherwise, `q` is not '+' and `M` will be 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the second character of `e`**.
