Output State: **Postcondition: `s` is an input integer, `e` is an empty string, `P` is the total number of '+' characters encountered in `e`, and `M` is the total number of '-' characters encountered in `e`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all iterations, the string `e` will be completely processed, meaning it will become an empty string. The variable `P` will hold the count of all '+' characters found in the original string `e`, and the variable `M` will hold the count of all '-' characters found in the original string `e`.
