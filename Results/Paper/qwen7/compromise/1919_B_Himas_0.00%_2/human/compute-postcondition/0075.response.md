Based on the initial state provided:

- `e` must contain at least one character.
- `P` is the total count of '+' characters in `e`.
- `M` is the total count of '-' characters in `e`.
- `i` is `len(e) + 1`.
- `q` is the last character of `e`.
- `s` is an input integer.

The print statement `print(P - M)` calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters (`P`) and the number of '-' characters (`M`) in the string `e`.

Since the exact content of `e` is not specified, we can only express the result in terms of `P` and `M`.

Output: **P - M**
