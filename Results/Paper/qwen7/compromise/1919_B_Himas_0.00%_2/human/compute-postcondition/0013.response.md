Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `s`: An input integer
- `e`: A non-empty string
- `P`: Either 1 or 0 depending on whether `q` equals '+'
- `M`: 1 if `q` does not equal '+' and 0 otherwise

### Loop Head:
```python
for q in e:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each character `q` in the string `e`.
- After each iteration, the variable `q` takes the value of the current character being processed from the string `e`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Character `q`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `q` was the last character processed from the string `e`. For the next iteration, `q` will be the next character in the string `e`.
2. **String `e`**: Since `e` is a non-empty string and characters are being consumed one by one, the length of `e` decreases by one with each iteration.
3. **Variables `P` and `M`**: These variables depend on the value of `q` from the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `P` and `M` will be updated based on the new value of `q`.

### Updated States:
- `s`: Remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
- `e`: Becomes the substring of `e` excluding the first character (the one just processed).
- `P`: Updated based on the new value of `q`.
- `M`: Updated based on the new value of `q`.

### Final State:
- `s`: An input integer (unchanged)
- `e`: A string that is `e` without its first character (non-empty, but one character shorter)
- `P`: 1 if the new `q` equals '+', 0 otherwise
- `M`: 1 if the new `q` does not equal '+', 0 otherwise

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
State: **`s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter, `P` is 1 if the new `q` equals '+', 0 otherwise, and `M` is 1 if the new `q` does not equal '+', 0 otherwise**.
