Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for q in e:`. The objects involved here are `q` and `e`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `q` is the variable used to iterate over each character in the string `e`.
   - `e` is the input string.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are characters left in the string `e`. Therefore, the loop will execute if and only if `e` is not an empty string.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `q` is used to iterate over each character in `e`, at the start of the loop, `q` should be set to the first character of `e`.
   - The string `e` itself must not be empty for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the other given variables**:
   - `s` is an input integer (not relevant for the loop).
   - `P` is 0 (not relevant for the loop).
   - `M` is 0 (not relevant for the loop).
   - `i` is `previous_i + 1` (not relevant for the loop).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `e` (it must not be an empty string) and `q` (it should be the first character of `e`).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the first character of `e`**
