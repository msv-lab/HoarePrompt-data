Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-', where the i-th character represents a_i = 1 if s_i = '+' and a_i = -1 if s_i = '-'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    s = int(input())
    e = input()
    P = 0
    M = 0
    for q in e:
        if q == '+':
            P += 1
        else:
            M += 1
    print(P - M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is an input integer, `e` is an empty string, `P` is the total number of '+' characters encountered in `e`, and `M` is the total number of '-' characters encountered in `e`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `P` will be equal to the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`, and `M` will be equal to the total number of characters in `e` that are not '+'. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `e` (since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, it will be one more than the length of `e`). The variable `q` will be the last character of `e`.

This means that if `e` is a string like "++-+--", then after the loop completes, `P` would be 3 (since there are three '+'), `M` would be 4 (since there are four characters that are not '+'), `i` would be 7 (the length of the string plus one), and `q` would be '-' (the last character of the string).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `e` must contain at least one character, `P` is the total count of '+' characters in `e`, `M` is the total count of '-' characters in `e`, `i` is `len(e) + 1`, `q` is the last character of `e`, and `s` is an input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
