Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the first character of `e`, and `q` is not '+', `M` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `M` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other number), resulting in `M` being 1. The values of `e` and `q` remain unchanged.
