Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Conditions for "Yes":**
   - If both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0`), the program prints 'yes'. This condition is correct because if both dimensions are even, you can always cut the rectangle into smaller even-sized rectangles and rearrange them to form another rectangle.
   - The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect. This condition checks if `a` and `b` are equal, but it is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed. For example, a 3x2 rectangle can be cut into 3x1 rectangles and rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, even though `a` and `b` are not equal.
   - The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is incorrect because it always evaluates to true (since `(a - b) % 2` will never be exactly 0 unless `a == b`). This means it incorrectly marks all cases where `a != b` as 'yes', which is not always correct.

3. **Conditions for "No":**
   - The program incorrectly handles the remaining cases. It should handle cases where at least one dimension is odd, and check if the other dimension can be split into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. However, the current logic does not correctly implement this.

### Correct Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If either `a` or `b` is 1, the rectangle cannot be split further into smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, the rectangle can always be split into smaller rectangles and rearranged to form a new rectangle, except when `a == b`.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1 and b == 1:
            print('No')
        elif a == b:
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed conditions and logic. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
