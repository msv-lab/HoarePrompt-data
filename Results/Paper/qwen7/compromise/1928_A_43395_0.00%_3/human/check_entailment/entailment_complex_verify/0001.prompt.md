You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'yes' and 'no' based on the conditions evaluated for each test case within the loop. For each test case, if both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'. If the difference between `a` and `b` equals `-a` or `-b`, it prints 'no'. If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks specific conditions involving \(a\) and \(b\), and prints either 'yes' or 'no' based on these conditions. Specifically, if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, it prints 'yes'. If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) equals \(-a\) or \(-b\), it prints 'no'. If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Conditions for "Yes":**
   - If both `a` and `b` are even (`a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0`), the program prints 'yes'. This condition is correct because if both dimensions are even, you can always cut the rectangle into smaller even-sized rectangles and rearrange them to form another rectangle.
   - The condition `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)` is incorrect. This condition checks if `a` and `b` are equal, but it is not sufficient to determine if another rectangle can be formed. For example, a 3x2 rectangle can be cut into 3x1 rectangles and rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, even though `a` and `b` are not equal.
   - The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is incorrect because it always evaluates to true (since `(a - b) % 2` will never be exactly 0 unless `a == b`). This means it incorrectly marks all cases where `a != b` as 'yes', which is not always correct.

3. **Conditions for "No":**
   - The program incorrectly handles the remaining cases. It should handle cases where at least one dimension is odd, and check if the other dimension can be split into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. However, the current logic does not correctly implement this.

### Correct Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If either `a` or `b` is 1, the rectangle cannot be split further into smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are greater than 1, the rectangle can always be split into smaller rectangles and rearranged to form a new rectangle, except when `a == b`.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1 and b == 1:
            print('No')
        elif a == b:
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed conditions and logic. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
