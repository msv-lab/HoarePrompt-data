Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in the solution only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the sorted array, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences as required by the problem statement.

To solve this problem correctly, we should aim to maximize the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). This can be achieved by sorting the array and then pairing the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This way, we ensure that the differences are maximized.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        max_beauty = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            max_beauty += a[n - 1 - i] - a[i]
        if n % 2 == 1:
            max_beauty += a[n // 2]
        print(max_beauty)

func()
```

This corrected program sorts the array and then iteratively pairs the elements from the start and end of the sorted array to maximize the sum of differences.
