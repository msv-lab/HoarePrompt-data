Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The key issue lies in the final step of the program. The program sorts the array for each test case and prints the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. However, the problem asks for the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements, not just the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

To achieve the maximum beauty, we should aim to maximize the sum of differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. This can be done by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements after sorting.

Here's the corrected explanation:

1. The program should sort the array for each test case.
2. Calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements after sorting.
3. Print the result for each test case.
4. Ensure the maximum beauty is calculated correctly for each test case.

Given this analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
