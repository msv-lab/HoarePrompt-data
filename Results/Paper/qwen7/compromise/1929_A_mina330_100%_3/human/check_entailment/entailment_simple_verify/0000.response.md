### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). This means we want to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program sorts the array and prints the difference between the last and first elements. This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty because the differences between consecutive elements are not optimized.

However, the original assessment suggests a different approach: sorting the array and pairing the smallest and largest elements to maximize the differences. This approach is correct but not necessary for the problem as stated. The problem does not require us to pair elements; it only requires us to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

Here's why the original program is actually correct:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized when the array is rearranged.
2. **Difference Calculation**: Printing the difference between the last and first elements after sorting gives the maximum possible difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is the best we can do without further rearrangement.

Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- Input: `3 10 5 15`
- After sorting: `[5, 10, 15]`
- The program outputs: `15 - 5 = 10`

This is indeed the maximum beauty because:
- The difference between the largest and smallest elements is `15 - 5 = 10`.
- Pairing the elements as suggested in the original assessment would result in the same maximum beauty: `(15 - 5) + (10 - 10) = 10`.

Thus, the original program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and achieves the desired result of maximizing the beauty of the array.
