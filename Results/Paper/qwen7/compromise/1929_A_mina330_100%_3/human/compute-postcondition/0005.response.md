Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` space-separated integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates the difference between the largest and smallest numbers. It then prints this difference for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs the maximum difference found across all test cases.**
