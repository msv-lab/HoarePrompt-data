Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a list of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for t and a list of n integers. It does not take any parameters itself but operates on the data provided through these test cases, returning a result for each one.
