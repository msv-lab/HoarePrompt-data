The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two lists of integers, `a` and `b`, both sorted in non-decreasing order. It then counts and prints the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the total count of such elements across all test cases.
