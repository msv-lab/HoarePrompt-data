Postcondition: `cnt` is either 0 or 2, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.
