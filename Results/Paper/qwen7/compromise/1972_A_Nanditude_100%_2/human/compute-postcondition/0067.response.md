Postcondition: `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is set to 1 and `i` remains 0. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0 and `i` is set to 1.
