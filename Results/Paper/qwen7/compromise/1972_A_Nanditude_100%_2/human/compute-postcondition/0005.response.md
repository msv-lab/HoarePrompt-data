Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
