Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` in the range `range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know the postconditions:
   - `cnt` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.
   - `i` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`.
   - `j` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented at the end of each iteration (as it ranges from 0 to `n-1`), `j` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `i` and `cnt` may change based on the condition inside the loop, but their values are not specified in the postcondition for the next iteration.
   - `n` is a constant defined outside the loop and does not change within the loop.

Given the above points, we need to adjust the state of `j` to reflect its new value at the start of the next iteration.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `j` will be `j + 1` because it ranges from 0 to `n-1`.
- `i` and `cnt` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Since the exact values of `i` and `cnt` are not specified in the postcondition for the next iteration, we will keep them as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final State**:
State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `i` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`**.
