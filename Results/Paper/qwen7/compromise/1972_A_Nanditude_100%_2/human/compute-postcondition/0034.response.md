Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is `n-1`**.

Explanation: The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `cnt` being set to 0 while keeping the other variables as they were initially.
