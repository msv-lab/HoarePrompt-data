Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
