Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. The conditions for updating `cnt` and `j` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than `j + 1` still holds.
