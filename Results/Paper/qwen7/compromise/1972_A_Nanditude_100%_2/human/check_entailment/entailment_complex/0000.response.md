Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure that for every problem \(i\), the actual difficulty \(a_i\) is less than or equal to the expected difficulty \(b_i\).
2. The provided solution iterates through the arrays `a` and `b` and counts how many times an element in `b` is less than the corresponding element in `a`.
3. This approach is correct because:
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means we need to propose a new problem with difficulty less than or equal to `b[j]` to replace the current `a[i]`.
   - By counting these instances, we get the number of new problems required.
4. The solution correctly handles the input and output as per the problem statement:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths and values of `a` and `b`, and then counts the required new problems.
5. The logic inside the loop is sound and correctly increments the count whenever an element in `b` is less than the current element in `a`.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
