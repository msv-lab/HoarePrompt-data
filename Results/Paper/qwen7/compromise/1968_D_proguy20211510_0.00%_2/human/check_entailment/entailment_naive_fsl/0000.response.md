Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not account for all possible moves and scores for both players over the k turns. Instead, it makes assumptions about the maximum value in the array `a` and the initial positions of Bodya and Sasha, which do not cover all scenarios.

For instance, consider the following test case:
- `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `pb = 1`, `ps = 3`
- `p = [2, 3, 1]`
- `a = [1, 10, 1]`

In this case, Bodya starts at position 1, and Sasha starts at position 3. The permutation and array `a` are such that Bodya can potentially get a higher score by moving to different positions, and Sasha can also move to different positions to maximize her score.

The program fails to properly simulate all possible moves and calculate the scores accurately for both players over the k turns. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
