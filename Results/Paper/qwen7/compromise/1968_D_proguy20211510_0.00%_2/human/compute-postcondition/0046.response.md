Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `foundb` is False, `founds` is True, `b` is a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\), `s` is a list with one element \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\), and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Given that `b` initially had one element \((k - (0 + 1)) * maxa\), after appending `a[pb - 1]`, `b` now contains two elements: the first element remains \((k - (0 + 1)) * maxa\) and the second element is `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
