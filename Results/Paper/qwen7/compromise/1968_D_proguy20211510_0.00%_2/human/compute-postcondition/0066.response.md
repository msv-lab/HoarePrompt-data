Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with two elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]\), `b` is a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\), and `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`.
