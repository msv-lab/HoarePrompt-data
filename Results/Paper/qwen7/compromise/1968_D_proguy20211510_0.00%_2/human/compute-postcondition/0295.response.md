Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`
- The current value of `maxs` is greater than the current value of `maxb`

The Python code snippet contains only one line:

```python
print('Sasha')
```

This line directly prints the string `'Sasha'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Sasha**
