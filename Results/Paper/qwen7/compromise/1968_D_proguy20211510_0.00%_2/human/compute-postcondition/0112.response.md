Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(len(s))`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `len(s)`**:
   - The variable `i` will be set to `k` at the start of the loop.
   - The variable `s` is defined as a list containing `k * maxa` repeated `k` times. Therefore, `len(s)` will be `k * k = k^2`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(s)`. Given that `len(s) = k^2`, the loop will execute as long as `i < k^2`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to `k`.
   - `len(s)` should be set to `k^2`.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(s)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `k`, `len(s)` is `k^2`**
