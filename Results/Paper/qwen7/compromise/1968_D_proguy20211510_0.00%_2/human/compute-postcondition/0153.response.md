Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxs` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptsb`.
- The condition `maxs < maxb` is false.

This means that `maxs` is greater than or equal to `maxb`.

Given this information, the print statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
