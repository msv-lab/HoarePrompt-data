Output State: **`b` is updated by appending the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to it; `s` contains the new value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to its current list.**

This means that the value of `b` remains unchanged from its previous state but now includes the new element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. The list `s` has had the new value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to it.
