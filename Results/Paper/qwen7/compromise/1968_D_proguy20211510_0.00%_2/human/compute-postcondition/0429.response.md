Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `pres`, `rem` will be `k - len(pres) - 1`, `ptsb` will contain the cumulative sum of `preb` from index 1 to the last index plus the contribution of `rem` for each element in `b`, and `ptss` will contain the cumulative sum of `pres` from index 3 to the last index plus the contribution of `rem` for each element in `s`.**

In more detail:
- The variable `i` will be set to the length of `pres`, which is the total number of iterations the loop runs.
- The variable `rem` will be calculated as `k - len(pres) - 1`.
- The list `ptsb` will be the sum of all elements in `preb` from index 1 to the last index, plus `rem` multiplied by each corresponding element in `b`.
- The list `ptss` will be the sum of all elements in `pres` from index 3 to the last index, plus `rem` multiplied by each corresponding element in `s`.
