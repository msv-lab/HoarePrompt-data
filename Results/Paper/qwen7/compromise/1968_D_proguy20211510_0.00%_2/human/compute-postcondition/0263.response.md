Output State: **`i` is 3; `preb` is a list containing the string `sb + b[0]`; `sb` is equal to `sb + b[1]`; `pres` is a list containing the string `ss + s[i-1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after the operation `i` becomes 3. The value of `ss + s[i]` is `ss + s[2]`, which is `ss + s[i-1]`. The other variables (`preb` and `sb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
