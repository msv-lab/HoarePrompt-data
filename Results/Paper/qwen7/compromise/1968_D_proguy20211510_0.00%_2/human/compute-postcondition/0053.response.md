Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True, `s` is a list with two elements \([(k - (1 + 1)) * maxa, maxa]\), `b` is a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\)**.

Explanation: The code `s.append(maxa)` appends the value of `maxa` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains one element \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\). After appending `maxa`, `s` now contains two elements: \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\) and `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
