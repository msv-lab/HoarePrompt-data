Output State: **`i` is 9; `ss` is updated to include `s[9]`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is initially set to 9. The line `ss += s[i]` appends the character at index `i` (which is 9) in the string `s` to the string `ss`. Since the exact content of `s` is not given, we can only say that `ss` is updated to include the character at index 9. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
