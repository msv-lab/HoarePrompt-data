Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` is a list with two elements \([(k - (0 + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1]]\), `s` is a list with one element \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\), and the condition `a[pb - 1] == maxa` is true.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Given that `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, the list `b` now contains two elements: the original element \((k - (0 + 1)) * maxa\) and the new element `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
