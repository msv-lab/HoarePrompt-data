The code snippet `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, `b` is a list with three elements: `[b[0], a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]`. After appending `a[pb - 1]` to `b`, the new list `b` will have four elements.

Since `b` initially had three elements and one more element is appended, the updated list `b` will be: `[b[0], a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1]]`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with three elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), `b` is a list with four elements \([b[0], a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1]]\), and `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa**.
