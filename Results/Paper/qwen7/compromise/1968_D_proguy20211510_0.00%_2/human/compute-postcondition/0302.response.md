Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`
- The value of `maxs` is greater than or equal to `maxb`

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print('Draw')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'` regardless of the values of `maxs` and `maxb`.

Output: **Draw**
