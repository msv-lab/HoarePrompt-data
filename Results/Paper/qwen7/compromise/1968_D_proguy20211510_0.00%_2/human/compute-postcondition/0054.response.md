Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is False, `s` is a list with one element \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\). Additionally, `b` is a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\), where `a[pb - 1] == maxa` if `foundb` is True, otherwise `b` remains as \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\) and `foundb` is updated accordingly.
