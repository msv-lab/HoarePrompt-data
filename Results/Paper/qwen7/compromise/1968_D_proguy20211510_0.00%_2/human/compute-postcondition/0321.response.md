Postcondition: **`maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer converted from the original `n`, `k` is an integer converted from the original `k`, `pb` is an integer converted from the original `pb`, `ps` is an integer converted from the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, no changes are made. Otherwise, the loop or iteration continues.**
