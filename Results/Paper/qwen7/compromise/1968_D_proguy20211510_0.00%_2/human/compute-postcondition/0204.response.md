Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa`, `s` contains an element which is `(k - 2) * maxa` and the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the last element of `a` (which is `a[ps - 1]` and is equal to `maxa`) to the list `s`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the list `s`.
