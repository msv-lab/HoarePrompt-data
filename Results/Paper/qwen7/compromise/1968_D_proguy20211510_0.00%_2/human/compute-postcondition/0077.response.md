Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with three elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), `b` is a list with four elements \([b[0], a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1]]\), and `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `pb = p[pb - 1]` updates the value of `pb` to be the value of `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
