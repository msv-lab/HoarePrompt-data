Output State: **`i` is less than \( k^2 \); `rem` is \( k - i - 1 \); `ptsb` is a list with one additional element which is `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptsb`. This value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, where `rem` is defined as `k - i - 1`. Since `i` is less than \( k^2 \) and `rem` is \( k - i - 1 \), the new element in `ptsb` is `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]`. The values of `i` and `rem` remain unchanged, and the list `ptsb` now includes this new element.
