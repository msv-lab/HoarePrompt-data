Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for` statement.
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
   ```

2. **Understand the loop variable and its initial state**: The loop variable `_` is used here, but it is not named explicitly. Typically, this is used when the loop variable itself is not needed within the loop body. The key part here is the `range(int(input()))`.

3. **Determine the state changes**: The loop will iterate based on the input provided to `int(input())`. Let's assume the input is `n`. This means the loop will run `n` times.

4. **Initial state before the first iteration**: The initial state is given as:
   - `maxs` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptss`.
   - `maxb` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptsb`.

5. **State after each iteration**: Since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider how the loop head affects the state. The loop head does not change the values of `maxs` or `maxb` directly; it only controls the number of iterations.

6. **State at the start of the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the input to `int(input())` must be decremented by 1 from the previous iteration. Therefore, the new input should be `n - 1`.

7. **Adjust the state**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value for the next iteration, which will be `n - 1`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`maxs` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptsb`; the input value for the next iteration is `n - 1`**.
