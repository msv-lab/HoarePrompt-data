The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. The values of all variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer converted from the first input value minus 1, `k` is an integer converted from the second input value, `pb` is an integer converted from the third input value, `ps` is an integer converted from the fourth input value, `maxs` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the next input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**
