The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no specific action is taken within the loop (other than potentially skipping to the next iteration), the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer converted from the original `n`, `k` is an integer converted from the original `k`, `pb` is an integer converted from the original `pb`, `ps` is an integer converted from the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`.**
