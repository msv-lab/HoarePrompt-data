Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `maxa = max(a)` calculates the maximum value in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
