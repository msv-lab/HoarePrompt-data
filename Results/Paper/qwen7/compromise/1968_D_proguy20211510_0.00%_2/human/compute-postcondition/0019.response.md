Postcondition: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`. `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`. Either `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `a[ps - 1]` or at least one of `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**
