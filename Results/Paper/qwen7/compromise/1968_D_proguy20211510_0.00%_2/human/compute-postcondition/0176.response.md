Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` contains an element which is `(k - (0 + 1)) * maxa`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` changes from 0 to 1. The list `b` is updated by appending a new element, which is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Since `i` was 0 before the increment, the expression simplifies to `(k - 1) * maxa`. The values of `k`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged.
