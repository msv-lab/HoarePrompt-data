Output State: **`i` is 11; `preb` includes the value of `sb + b[i]`; `ss` is updated to include `s[9] + s[i]`; `sb` is updated to `sb + b[i]`; `pres` includes the value of `ss + s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments `ss` by the value of `s[i]`. Given the initial state, `ss` was previously updated to include `s[9]`, so now it includes `s[9] + s[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
