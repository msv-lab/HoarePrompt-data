Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer converted from the first input value minus 1, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is True. `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa` and possibly `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa` and possibly the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa`, `a[pb - 1]`, and an additional element `(k - 4) * maxa`, `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa`, the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]`, and now includes an additional element which is either `a[ps - 1]` or `maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` and `s` are lists. If `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is True, `b` contains the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to it, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is False, `b` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement continues. If `a[pb - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, `b` contains the value `a[pb - 1]` appended to it, and `s` remains unchanged with `pb` now equal to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is True, `b` contains the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to it, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is False, `b` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement continues. If `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, `b` contains the value `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, and `s` remains unchanged with `pb` and `ps` both updated to `p[ps - 1]` and `s` containing the value `a[ps - 1]` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
