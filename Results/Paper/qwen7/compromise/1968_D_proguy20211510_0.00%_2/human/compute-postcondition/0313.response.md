Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
- `n` is an integer converted from the original `n`.
- `k` is an integer converted from the original `k`.
- `pb` is an integer converted from the original `pb`.
- `ps` is an integer converted from the original `ps`.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'`.

Since none of the variables mentioned in the `print` statement are used in the output, the output is solely determined by the string provided in the `print` statement itself.

Output: **Draw**
