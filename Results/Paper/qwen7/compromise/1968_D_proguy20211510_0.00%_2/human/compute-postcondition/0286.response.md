Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(pres))`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `ptsb` now contains the new element `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`
   - `rem` is `k - (i + 1)`
   - `ptss` now contains the new elements `pres[i+1] + rem * s[i+1]` and `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(len(pres))`, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, if `i` was previously `i`, it will now be `i + 1`.
   - `rem` will be updated based on the new value of `i`, so `rem` will be `k - ((i + 1) + 1) = k - (i + 2)`.

4. **Update the states accordingly**:
   - `ptsb` will contain the new element `preb[i + 1] + rem * b[i + 1]`.
   - `rem` will be `k - (i + 2)`.
   - `ptss` will contain the new elements `pres[i + 2] + rem * s[i + 2]` and `pres[i + 1] + rem * s[i + 1]`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: `ptsb` now contains the new element `preb[i + 1] + rem * b[i + 1]`, `rem` is `k - (i + 2)`, `ptss` now contains the new elements `pres[i + 2] + rem * s[i + 2]` and `pres[i + 1] + rem * s[i + 1]`**
