Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with two elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]\), `b` is a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\), and `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with four elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]\), `b` is a list with four elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]\) if `foundb` is True, or \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1] or a[pb - 1] if pb is used instead of ps]\) if `foundb` is False, and either `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `foundb` is True, or `pb` is `p[pb - 1]`.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after executing the if-else block. It covers both scenarios where `founds` is True and where it is False, ensuring that all possible outcomes are accounted for.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 4, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with six elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]\) or \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]\), `b` is a list with five elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]\) if `foundb` is True, or \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1]]\) if `foundb` is False, and either `b` is appended with `maxa` or `pb` is incremented by 1 if `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and `foundb` is False, or `ps` is updated to the value of `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa` and `foundb` is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
