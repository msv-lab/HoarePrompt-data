Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `p` is a permutation of length `n`; `a` is an array of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i; `YES` and `NO` are string values 'YES' and 'NO' respectively; `MOD` is set to 10^9 + 7; `alpha` is a string containing the characters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxa = max(a)
    if a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Draw')
        continue
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        print('Bodya')
        continue
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Sasha')
        continue
    b, s = [], []
    founds, foundb = False, False
    for i in range(k):
        if foundb and founds:
            b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            break
        if foundb:
            b.append(maxa)
        elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
            foundb = True
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
        else:
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
            pb = p[pb - 1]
        if founds:
            s.append(maxa)
        elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
            founds = True
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
        else:
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
            ps = p[ps - 1]
    preb, pres = [], []
    sb, ss = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        preb.append(sb + b[i])
        sb += b[i]
        pres.append(ss + s[i])
        ss += s[i]
    ptsb, ptss = [], []
    for i in range(len(pres)):
        rem = k - (i + 1)
        ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
        ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])
    maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)
    if maxs > maxb:
        print('Sasha')
    elif maxs < maxb:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `maxs` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptsb`. After the if-else block executes, the relationship between `maxs` and `maxb` remains unchanged, meaning `maxs` will still be the maximum value among the elements in `ptss` and `maxb` will still be the maximum value among the elements in `ptsb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. Regardless of whether `maxs` is greater than, less than, or equal to `maxb`, their respective maximum values in `ptss` and `ptsb` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `maxs` is the maximum value of the cumulative sum of `pres` from index 3 to the last index plus the contribution of `rem` for each element in `s`; `maxb` is the maximum value of the cumulative sum of `preb` from index 1 to the last index plus the contribution of `rem` for each element in `b`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb` in the if part, `maxs` remains the maximum value. Otherwise, `maxb` remains the maximum value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
