Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(s)`, `preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb + b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `sb` is equal to the sum of all elements in list `b`, `pres` is a list containing the sum of `ss + s[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `ss` is equal to the sum of all elements in list `s`, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `ptsb` and `ptss`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `preb`, `sb`, `pres`, and `ss`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
