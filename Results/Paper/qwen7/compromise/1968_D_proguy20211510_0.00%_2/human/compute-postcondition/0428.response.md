Output State: **`i` is 5, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[1] + (k - 1) * b[1] + preb[4] + (k - i - 1) * b[4] + preb[5] + rem * b[5]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[3] + (k - 1) * s[3]` and is now appended with the value `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`, and `ptss` is a list.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ptss`. The new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, where `i` is 5 and `rem` is `k - i - 1`. Therefore, the new element added to `ptss` is `pres[5] + (k - 5 - 1) * s[5]`, which simplifies to `pres[5] + (k - 6) * s[5]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
