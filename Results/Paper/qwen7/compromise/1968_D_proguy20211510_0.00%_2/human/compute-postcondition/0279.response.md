Output State: **`rem` is `k - (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code `rem = k - (i + 1)` assigns the value of `k - (i + 1)` to the variable `rem`. The values of `k` and `i` are used in the calculation, and `rem` is updated to reflect this new value. The initial states of other variables remain unchanged.
