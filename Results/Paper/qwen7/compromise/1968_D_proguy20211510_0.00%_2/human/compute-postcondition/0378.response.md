Output State: **`maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer converted from the original `n`, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is an integer converted from the original `pb`, `ps` is an integer converted from the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list where the last element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, the second last element is either `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`, `s` is a list containing either two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `maxa` or two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `a[ps - 1]`, `founds` is `True` if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `True` if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `b`. The new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given that `i` was initially 5, after executing `i -= 1`, `i` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
