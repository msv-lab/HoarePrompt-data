Output State: **`i` is less than \( k^2 \); `rem` is \( k - i - 1 \)**

Explanation: The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k - (i + 1)`. Since `i` is less than \( k^2 \), the value of `rem` is calculated as \( k - i - 1 \). The state of `len(pres)` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
