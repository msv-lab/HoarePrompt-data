Output State: **`i` is 4; `preb` is a list containing the strings `sb + b[0]` and `sb + b[4]`; `sb` is equal to `sb + b[1]`; `pres` is a list containing the string `ss + s[3]`; `ss` is `ss + s[2]`.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` remains unchanged at 4.
- The `preb` list initially contains the string `sb + b[0]`. After executing `preb.append(sb + b[i])`, it now also contains the string `sb + b[4]`.
- The variable `sb` is updated to `sb + b[1]` (unchanged from the initial state).
- The `pres` list initially contains the string `ss + s[3]`. This remains unchanged.
- The variable `ss` is updated to `ss + s[2]` (unchanged from the initial state).
