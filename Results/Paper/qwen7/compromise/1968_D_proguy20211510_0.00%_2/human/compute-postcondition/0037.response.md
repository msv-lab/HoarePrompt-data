Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` is a list with two elements \([(k - (0 + 1)) * maxa, maxa]\), `s` is a list with one element \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\)**.

Explanation: The code `b.append(maxa)` appends the value of `maxa` to the list `b`. Initially, `b` contains one element \((k - (0 + 1)) * maxa\). After appending `maxa`, `b` now contains two elements: \((k - (0 + 1)) * maxa\) and `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
