Output State: **`i` is 5, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[1] + (k - 1) * b[1] + preb[4] + (k - i - 1) * b[4] + preb[5] + rem * b[5]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[3] + (k - 1) * s[3]`, and `ptss` is appended with the value `pres[4] + (k - i - 1) * s[4]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptsb`. The new value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, which translates to `preb[5] + rem * b[5]` given that `i` is 5 and `rem` is `k - i - 1`. This new value is added to the existing elements in `ptsb`. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
