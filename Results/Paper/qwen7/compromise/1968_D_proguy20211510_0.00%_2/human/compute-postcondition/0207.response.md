Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is False, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa`, and `s` contains an element which is `(k - 2) * maxa`, and `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, and `s` now contains an additional element which is `a[ps - 1]`**.

This means that the list `s` has appended the value of `a[ps - 1]` to itself, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
