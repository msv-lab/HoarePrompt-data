Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` is a list with one element \((k - (0 + 1)) * maxa\), `s` is a list with one element \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\), and the condition `a[pb - 1] == maxa` is true.**

Explanation: The code sets `foundb` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
