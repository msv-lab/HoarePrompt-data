Output State: `i` is `k^2`, `len(s)` is `k^2`, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `s` multiplied by `k`, `ss` is the same as `pres`, `preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb` plus each element of `b` from index `k+1` to `k^2-1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k^2` since the loop runs from `0` to `len(s) - 1` and `len(s)` is `k^2`. The variable `sb` accumulates the sum of all elements in `b` as each element is added in the loop. Similarly, `ss` accumulates the sum of all elements in `s`, and since `pres` is updated in each iteration, it ends up being the sum of all elements in `s` multiplied by `k`. The list `preb` contains the cumulative sums of `sb` plus each element of `b` starting from the element at index `k+1` to the last element of `b`.
