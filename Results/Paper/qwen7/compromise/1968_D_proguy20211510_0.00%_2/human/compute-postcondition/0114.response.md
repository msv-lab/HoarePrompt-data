Output State: **`i` is `k+1`, `len(s)` is `k^2`, `sb` is `preb[-1] + b[i-1]`**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` increments `sb` by the value of `b[i]`. Given that `i` is `k+1`, the value of `b[i-1]` is `b[k]`. The last element of `preb` is `sb + b[i-1]`, which means `preb[-1]` is `sb + b[k]`. Therefore, `sb` is updated to `sb + b[k]`, which is equivalent to `preb[-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
