Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` is a list with one element \((k - (0 + 1)) * maxa\), `s` is a list with one element \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\). Since the condition `(foundb)` is True, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
