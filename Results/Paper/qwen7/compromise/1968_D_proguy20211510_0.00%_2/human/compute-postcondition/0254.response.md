Output State: **`b` is a list containing the value `a[ps - 1]` appended to it if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is True, otherwise it remains unchanged; `s` contains the value `a[ps - 1]` appended to it; `pb` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`; `foundb` remains unchanged; `a` and `p` remain unchanged; `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.**

This means that the value of `ps` is now set to the value of `p[ps - 1]`, while all other variables (`b`, `s`, `pb`, `foundb`, `a`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
