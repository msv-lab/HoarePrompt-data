The function accepts a list of integers `arr` representing the positions of the pinball on a grid over time, an integer `times` representing the elapsed seconds, and an integer `l` representing the length of the grid. It calculates and returns the difference between the pinball's position at the current time and its position at a time `max(-l, -1 - times)` seconds ago.
