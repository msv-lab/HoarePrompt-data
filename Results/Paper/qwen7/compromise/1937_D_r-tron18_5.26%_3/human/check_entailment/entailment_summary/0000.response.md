Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The pinball starts at a specific cell and moves left or right based on the direction indicated by the character in that cell. After each move, the direction is reversed. The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**: 
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the direction is '>'.
     - `totalOne` counts the number of such indices.
     - `preOne` is a prefix sum array for `pre`.
     - `suffZero` is initialized to `[0]`.
     - `ans` is initialized to a list of zeros of length `n`.

   - **Processing from Right to Left**:
     - For each index `i` from `n-1` to `0`:
       - If the direction at `i` is '>', calculate the time taken considering the balance of '>' and '<'.
       - If the direction at `i` is '<', update `suffZero` and recalculate the time similarly.
     - The calculations involve using `func_1` to compute differences in positions based on the prefix sums.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` seems to correctly account for the movement of the pinball and the reversal of directions.
   - The use of prefix sums (`preOne`) and suffix sums (`suffZero`) helps in efficiently calculating the required times.
   - The overall structure of the function matches the problem requirements and the provided examples.

Given the detailed implementation and the logical flow, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
