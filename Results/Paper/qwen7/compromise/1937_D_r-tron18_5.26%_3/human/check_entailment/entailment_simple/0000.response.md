Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid based on the direction indicated by each cell ('<' or '>'), and calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Key Components**:
   - The pinball's movement is determined by the direction in each cell.
   - The direction is toggled after each move.
   - The pinball stops when it reaches the boundary of the grid.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function calculates the position of the pinball at a specific time using the accumulated positions. However, there seems to be a logical error in this function as it uses `max(-n, -1 - times)` which might not correctly represent the previous position.
   - **func_2**: This function correctly calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid. It uses prefix sums (`preOne`) and suffix sums (`suffZero`) to efficiently compute the required values.

4. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The algorithm in `func_2` correctly handles both cases ('>' and '<') and updates the necessary lists (`preOne` and `suffZero`) as it iterates through the string `s1`.
   - The logic for updating `ans` based on the current character and the accumulated values is sound and should produce the correct results.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the pinball is initially placed at the boundary or when the grid is entirely composed of one direction ('<' or '>').
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums ensures efficient computation even for large grids.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem. The main function `func_2` correctly calculates the time for each pinball to leave the grid based on the initial grid configuration.

Correctness: **True**
