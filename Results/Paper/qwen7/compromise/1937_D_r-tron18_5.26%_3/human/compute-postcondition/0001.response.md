Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each element is the index (i + 1) of every occurrence of '>' in `s1`.**

Explanation: The code `totalOne = len(pre)` calculates the length of the list `pre` and assigns it to the variable `totalOne`. The value of `s1` and the list `pre` remain unchanged from their initial state. The output state includes the updated value of `totalOne` and retains the initial conditions of `s1` and `pre`.
