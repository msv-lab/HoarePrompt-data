The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers. It sorts these integers into two lists, `a` and `b`, based on specific conditions. For each test case, it counts how many times an element in list `b` is greater than the previous element. Finally, it prints the total count of such instances across all test cases.
