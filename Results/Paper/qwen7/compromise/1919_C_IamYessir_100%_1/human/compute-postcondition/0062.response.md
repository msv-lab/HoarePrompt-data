Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being `x`, `i` is 0, `x` is less than `y`, `x` is not equal to `y`, `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is appended to `b`**.

The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` is 0, `lit[i]` is the first element of the list `lit`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
