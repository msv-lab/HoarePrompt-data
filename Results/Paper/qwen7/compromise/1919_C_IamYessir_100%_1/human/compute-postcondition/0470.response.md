Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is 2
   - `i` is 3
   - `a` is a non-empty list
   - If the element at index `i` in list `a` is greater than the element at index `i-1`, then `s` remains 2. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `i` and `a`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, len(a)):
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from 1 to `len(a) - 1`.
   - The loop does not directly modify `s` or `a` unless the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` is true.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

5. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - Therefore, `i + 1` (which would be the next value of `i`) is 4.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(a) - 1`, the loop will continue as long as `i < len(a)`.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `s` remains 2 because the condition `a[i] > a[i - 1]` was not met in the previous iteration.
   - `i` will be incremented to 4.
   - `a` remains unchanged.

7. **New State:**
   - `s` is still 2.
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `a` remains a non-empty list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`s` is 2, `i` is 4, `a` is a non-empty list**
