Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a non-empty list; `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`.**

The code assigns the last element of list `a` to the variable `x`. Since `a` is a non-empty list, `x` will be set to the last element of `a`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
