Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is either `len(b) + 4` or `len(b) + 5`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]`, `a` remains unchanged. If `x < y` and `lit[i] > y`, `a` is updated to include `lit[i]` as its last element. If `x < y`, `i` is incremented by 1.**
