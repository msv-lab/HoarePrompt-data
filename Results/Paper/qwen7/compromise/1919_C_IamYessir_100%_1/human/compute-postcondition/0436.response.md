Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list where the last element is `lit[2]`; `b` is a list with two elements and the last element is `b[1]`; and `y` is `b[1]` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 2, `a` will append `lit[2]` to its existing elements. The other variables (`n`, `b`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
