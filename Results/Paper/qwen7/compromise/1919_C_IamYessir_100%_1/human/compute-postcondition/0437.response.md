Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where the last element is `lit[2]`, `b` is a list with two elements and the last element is `b[1]`, and `y` is `b[1]` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, `y` is `float('inf')`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` is greater than `y`, then `y` is updated to `lit[2]`. Otherwise, the values of `y`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.
