The code `x = a[-1]` assigns the last element of list `a` to variable `x`. If `a` is not empty, `x` will take the value of `a[-1]`. If `a` is empty, `x` remains `float('inf')` as specified in the initial state. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) + 4`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is `float('inf')`, `y` is `float('inf')` if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`.**
