Output State: **`a` is now ['lit[i]'], `b` is empty, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or `None`, `y` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`) or the last element of list `b` if `b` is not empty, and `x` is less than `y`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` is equal to `len(b)` and `b` is an empty list, `i` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their original values as no changes were made to them by the code.
