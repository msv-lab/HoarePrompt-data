Postcondition: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 0, `x` is less than or equal to `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, `a` has its last element as `lit[0]`. If `x` is less than `y`, `x` is added to `b` if `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[0]`.
