Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(b)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - From the postcondition, we know that `i` is equal to the length of `a`.
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, len(b))`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < len(b)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `len(b)` must be greater than 1 (since the loop starts from 1).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to the length of `a` before the loop starts.
   - We also need to ensure that `len(b)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the postcondition and the loop definition, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `len(b)`.

**Final State**:
- `i` should be set to the length of `a`.
- `len(b)` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
**State: **`i` is equal to the length of `a`, `len(b)` must be greater than 1**.
