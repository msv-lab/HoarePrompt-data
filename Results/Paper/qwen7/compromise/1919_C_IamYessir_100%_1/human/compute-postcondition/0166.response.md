Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `len(b)` is equal to `len(a)`
   - `n` must be less than `len(a)`
   - `s` is 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, len(b))`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `1` to `len(b) - 1`.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 2.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The length of `b` and `a` remains the same, so `len(b)` is still equal to `len(a)`.
   - `n` must still be less than `len(a)`.
   - `s` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop changes it, but since no such condition is mentioned, `s` stays as 1.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `len(b)` is equal to `len(a)`
   - `n` must be less than `len(a)`
   - `s` is 1

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `len(b)` is equal to `len(a)`, `n` must be less than `len(a)`, and `s` is 1**
