Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cp` is 0
   - `t` must be at least 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `lit` is a list of integers
   - `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`
   - `i` is 0
   - `y` is the last element of list `b`

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop runs as long as `i < n`, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `cp` remains 0 (unchanged)
   - `t` must still be at least 1 (unchanged)
   - `n` remains the same (unchanged)
   - `lit` remains the same (unchanged)
   - `a` remains the same (unchanged)
   - `i` is now 1
   - `y` remains the same (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is either an empty list or a non-empty list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 1, and `y` is the last element of list `b`.**
