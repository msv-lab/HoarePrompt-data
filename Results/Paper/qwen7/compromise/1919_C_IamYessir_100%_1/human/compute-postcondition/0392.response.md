Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`
- `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty)
- The postcondition specifies how `x` changes based on comparisons with `y` and `lit[0]`

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(0, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

### Current Values
- `i` is currently 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `a` and `x` are defined based on the postcondition
- `y` is defined based on the postcondition

### Next Iteration
- Since `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` will be 1.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

### Adjusting States
- `i` will be incremented to 1.
- `n` remains the same (must still be greater than 0).
- The values of `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them.

### Final State
- `i` will be 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `a`, `x`, and `y` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Conclusion
The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` will be 1.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

### Answer
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty)**
