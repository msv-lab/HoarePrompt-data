Output State: **Postcondition: `s` is equal to the number of elements in `a` minus one, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `a` is a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `s` each time it finds an element in the list `a` that is greater than its preceding element. After all iterations of the loop, `s` will be equal to the count of such instances in the list. Since the loop runs from index 1 to the length of `a` (exclusive), the final value of `i` will be the length of `a`. The list `a` itself does not change during the loop's execution.
