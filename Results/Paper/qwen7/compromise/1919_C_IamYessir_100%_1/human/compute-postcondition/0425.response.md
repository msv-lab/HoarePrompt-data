Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is a list where `x` is either infinity or the last element of the list `a`
   - `b` is a list with one more element than before and the appended element is `lit[1]`
   - `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty)
   - If `x > y`, then `y` is updated to `lit[1]` if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, otherwise no change is made to `y`.
   - If `x <= y`, then `a` is updated to include `lit[1]` appended to the original list, and `x` is either infinity or the last element of the updated list `a`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 0 (no change needed here since it was already stated to be greater than 0).

6. **List `a` and `b`**:
   - `b` now has two elements (since it had one more element than before and the appended element is `lit[1]`).
   - `y` is now the last element of `b` (since `b` now has two elements).

7. **Values of `x` and `y`**:
   - `x` is either infinity or the last element of the updated list `a`.
   - `y` is the last element of `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list where `x` is either infinity or the last element of the list `a`, `b` is a list with two elements and the last element is `lit[1]`, and `y` is the last element of list `b`**.
