Output State: **`a` and `b` are both empty lists, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is either positive infinity (`float('inf')`), `y` is positive infinity (`float('inf')`).**

Explanation: The code assigns `float('inf')` to the variable `y`. Since `a` and `b` are empty lists, `cp`, `i`, `n`, `s`, `lit`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the only new information is that `y` is now `float('inf')`.
