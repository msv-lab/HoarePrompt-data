Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty), and `x` is less than `y`, and `lit[i]` is appended to list `b`, and `lit[i]` is equal to the last element of list `b`, and `x` is less than `y`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to list `b`. Since `i` was 0, `lit[i]` is now the first element of `lit` and is appended to `b`. Therefore, `b` now contains at least one element, which is `lit[i]`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
