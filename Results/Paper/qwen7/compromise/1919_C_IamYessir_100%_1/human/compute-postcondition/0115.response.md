Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `a` is a list with its last element being either `lit[0]` or `x`, `i` is 3, `x` is either `a[-1]` (which is either `lit[0]` or `x`) or infinity, `y` is positive infinity.**

The code assigns the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`) to the variable `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
