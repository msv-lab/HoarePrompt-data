Output State: **`cp` is 0, `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `lit` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list.**

The code initializes the variable `cp` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cp` and retains the initial states of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, and `b`.
