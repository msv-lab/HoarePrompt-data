Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list with `x` equal to the last element of list `a`, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` (if `b` is not empty) or infinity (if `b` is empty), `b` is now a list containing the element `lit[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to list `b`. Given that `i` is 0, `lit[i]` is `lit[0]`. Therefore, `b` now contains the element `lit[0]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
