Output State: **`a` is now a list containing the element at index `i` of `lit`, `b` is unchanged, `cp` is 0, `i` is len(`b`) + 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the total count of elements in `b` where each element is greater than the previous one, `lit` is a list of integers converted from input split by spaces, `x` is a specific value from `a[-1]` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is float('inf'), `y` is float('inf') if `b` is empty, otherwise `y` is the last element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` of `lit` to the list `a`. Since `i` is defined as `len(b) + 2`, the value of `i` remains unchanged. All other variables remain in their initial states.
