Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of `b`.
- `s` is equal to the number of times `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` for all valid `i` in the range of `1` to `len(b) - 1`.
- `len(b)` is greater than `0`.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(s)` is executed.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Length of `b`:**
   - Since `i` is equal to the length of `b`, it means `i = len(b)`.

2. **Value of `s`:**
   - `s` is defined as the number of times `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` for all valid `i` in the range of `1` to `len(b) - 1`.
   - Given that `i = len(b)`, the valid range for `i` would be from `1` to `len(b) - 1`.
   - However, since `i` itself is equal to `len(b)`, there are no valid `i` values in the range `1` to `len(b) - 1`.

### Conclusion:
Since there are no valid `i` values in the specified range, the value of `s` will be `0`.

Output: **0**
