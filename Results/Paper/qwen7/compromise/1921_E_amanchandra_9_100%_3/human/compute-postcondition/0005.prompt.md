You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. Additionally, the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= 
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if `a > c`, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates `x` as half the absolute difference between `a` and `c`. If the absolute difference is odd, it sets `l` and `r` based on `d` and checks if `b` falls within the range `[l, r]` with a tolerance of `x+1`. If so, it prints 'Alice'; otherwise, it prints 'Draw'. If the absolute difference is even, it sets `l` and `r` based on `b` and checks if `d` falls within the range `[l, r]` with a tolerance of `x`. If so, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) within specified ranges and returns a value based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
