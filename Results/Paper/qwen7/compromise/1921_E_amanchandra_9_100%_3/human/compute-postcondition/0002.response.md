Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified within the loop for each iteration. For each input set, if \(a > c\), it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the value of \(x\) as half the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(c\). Depending on whether this difference is even or odd, it then determines the ranges for \(l\) and \(r\) and checks if the given values \(b\) and \(d\) fall within these ranges to decide whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins.
