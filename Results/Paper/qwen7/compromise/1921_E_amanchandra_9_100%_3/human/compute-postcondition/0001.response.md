State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts, so no adjustment is needed for `_`.
- The variable `t` is the control variable for the loop and must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) for the loop to execute. If `t` is not within this range, the loop will not run.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
