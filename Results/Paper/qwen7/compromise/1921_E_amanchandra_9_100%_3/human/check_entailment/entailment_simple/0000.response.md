Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by splitting the input into the dimensions of the board (`h`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`).

2. **Initial Condition Check**: The program checks if `a > c` (Alice's row position compared to Bob's row position). If this condition is true, it directly prints 'Draw', which is correct because Alice cannot move down from the top row while Bob is still above her.

3. **Even Distance Calculation**: When the distance between Alice and Bob's rows is even, the program calculates `x` as half of the absolute difference between `a` and `c`. It then sets the left (`l`) and right (`r`) bounds for Bob's column position based on `b` and checks if `d` (Bob's column position) falls within these bounds with a tolerance of `x`. This logic is correct because Bob can move within this range without overlapping with Alice's position.

4. **Odd Distance Calculation**: When the distance between Alice and Bob's rows is odd, the program calculates `x` similarly but sets the left (`l`) and right (`r`) bounds for Bob's column position based on `d` and checks if `b` (Alice's column position) falls within these bounds with a tolerance of `x + 1`. This logic is also correct because Alice can move within this range without overlapping with Bob's position.

5. **Output Formatting**: The program uses a ternary operator to format the output string based on the conditions checked. This ensures that the correct output ('Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob') is printed for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected outputs for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
