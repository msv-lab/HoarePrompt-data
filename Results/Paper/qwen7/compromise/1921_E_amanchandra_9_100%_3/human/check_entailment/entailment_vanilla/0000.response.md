Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Position Comparison:**
   - The program checks if `a > c` (Alice's row position is greater than Bob's row position).
   - If `a > c`, it directly prints 'Draw'. This condition is correct because if Alice is in a higher row than Bob, Alice cannot capture Bob since Bob can only move upwards and Alice can only move downwards, diagonally downwards, or sideways.

3. **Case When Alice is Not in a Higher Row:**
   - If `a <= c`, the program proceeds to calculate the midpoint `x` between Alice's and Bob's rows.
   - It then calculates the range `[l, r]` where Alice can potentially capture Bob by moving diagonally.
   - The program checks if Bob's column position `b` falls within this range `[l, r]` considering the distance `x`.

4. **Capture Conditions:**
   - If the absolute difference between Bob's column position and the left boundary `l` or right boundary `r` is less than or equal to `x + 1`, Alice can capture Bob.
   - Otherwise, Bob can capture Alice if the same condition holds true but with Alice's column position.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the column positions might be out of bounds by using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)` to ensure the calculated column positions are within the valid range.

### Correctness Verification:

- The logic for determining the outcome based on the relative positions and movements is sound.
- The program correctly identifies when Alice or Bob can capture the other player based on the given rules.
- The handling of edge cases (column positions being out of bounds) is appropriate.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the game logic and outputs the correct result for each test case based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
