Output State: **`position` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `n` right-shifted by 1 bit, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `n >>= 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `n` by 1 bit. This means that each bit in the binary representation of `n` is shifted one position to the right, and the least significant bit is discarded. The value of `n` is effectively divided by 2. The other variables (`position`, `t`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
