You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and n is not equal to 0. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `position` is 32, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is now 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to right-shift `n` by 1 bit and increment `position` until `n` becomes 0. Since each iteration halves the value of `n`, and it takes 32 iterations to reduce any non-zero integer within the given constraints to 0 through right-shifting, `position` will be 32 when the loop terminates. At this point, `n` will be 0 because it has been fully right-shifted. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns 31
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter n, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. Depending on the value of n, the function returns either -1 or 31.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns 31


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
