Output State: **The program returns 31**

Explanation: Given the initial state, the loop right-shifts `n` by 1 bit and increments `position` until `n` becomes 0. As described, it takes 32 iterations to reduce any non-zero integer within the given constraints to 0. Therefore, `position` is set to 32 when the loop terminates. The code then returns `position - 1`, which results in 31.
