Output State: **`position` is 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is now one-fourth of its original value.**

The code `position += 1` increments the value of `position` by 1. Initially, `position` is 2, so after executing the code, `position` becomes 3. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
