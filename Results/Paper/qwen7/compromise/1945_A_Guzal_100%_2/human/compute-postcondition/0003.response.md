Output State: The value of `k` will be the sum of `a + (b + c) // 3` for each iteration where `(b + c) % 3 == 0` or `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, an additional 1 is added to `k`. If `(b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3)` is true for any iteration, the program will print -1 and terminate early. Otherwise, the final value of `k` will be printed after all iterations.
