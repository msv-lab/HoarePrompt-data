Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. Then, it sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and adjusts `k` accordingly. For each subsequent element `nums[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), it assigns the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k` to `nums[i]` and decreases `k` by the assigned value. Finally, it ensures `nums[0]` is updated to the remaining value of `k`. The function returns the list `nums`.**
