Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the `func_1` function. The function aims to construct a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers such that their sum equals \( k \) and the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. The function starts by setting the first element of the list `nums` to \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\). This value is chosen because it is the largest number with \( k \) bits set to 1, which helps maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

3. For each subsequent element in the list, the function assigns the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k` to `nums[i]` and decreases `k` by the assigned value. This ensures that the sum of the elements remains equal to `k` while trying to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

4. After assigning values to all elements, the function updates `nums[0]` to the remaining value of `k`. This step is necessary to ensure that the sum of the entire list is exactly `k`.

5. The overall approach is correct and should produce a valid sequence for each test case as per the problem statement.

6. The annotated program correctly reflects the state transitions and the final output format.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
