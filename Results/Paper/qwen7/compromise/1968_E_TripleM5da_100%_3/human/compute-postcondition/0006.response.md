Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is at least 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

3. **Update the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was at least 3, it will now be at least 4.
   - `n` must still be at least 3 for the loop to continue, but it could potentially be larger depending on the loop body.

Given these points, the updated state should reflect that `i` is at least 4 and `n` is still at least 3.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is at least 4, `n` is at least 3**
