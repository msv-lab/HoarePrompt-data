Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is set to `n + 1`.
2. We also know that `n` must be greater than 5.
3. Therefore, `i` will be `n + 1`, where `n` is some integer greater than 5.
4. When the `print(i, i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i` twice.

Given that `i = n + 1` and `n > 5`, the value of `i` will be an integer greater than 6.

Output: **i, i (where i is n + 1 and n > 5)**
