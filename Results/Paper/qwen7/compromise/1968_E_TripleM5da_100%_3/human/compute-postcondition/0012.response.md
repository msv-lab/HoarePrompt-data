Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `i` will be `n`, and `n` must be greater than 4.

2. **Loop Head Analysis**: The for loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(0, int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**: 
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < int(input())`.

4. **Final Condition**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` will be equal to `n`.
   - This means `n` must be the value of `int(input())` minus 1 because the loop starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.

5. **Next Iteration**: 
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.
   - Since `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, `i` should be `n` (which is `int(input()) - 1`).

6. **Adjusting States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 4 because the loop condition requires `i < int(input())`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 4**.
