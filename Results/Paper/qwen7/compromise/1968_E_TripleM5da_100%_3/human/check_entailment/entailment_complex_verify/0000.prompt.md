You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(1, 1)
        
        print(1, 2)
        
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` will be `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 5.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n + 1`. The loop starts with `i` as 3 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`. For the loop to run all iterations, `n` must be greater than 5, as it needs to go through at least 3 increments (from 3 to 4, then 4 to 5, and so on) to reach `n`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \( t \) and \( n \). For each test case, if \( 1 \leq t \leq 50 \) and \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \), it prints specific pairs of integers. Specifically, it prints "1 1", "1 2", followed by pairs "i i" for \( i \) ranging from 3 to \( n \). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. According to the problem description, we need to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) which contains distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. However, the program always prints the first two points as (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then prints the remaining points as (i, i) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This approach does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

For example, consider \(n = 3\):
- The program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  ```
- The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) would be \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), which has a size of 3.

However, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) as described in the problem's note is:
- Cells at positions (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1).
- The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) would be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4.

Thus, the program does not generate the optimal solution for all \(n\), making it incorrect.
