Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. According to the problem description, we need to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) which contains distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. However, the program always prints the first two points as (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then prints the remaining points as (i, i) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\). This approach does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

For example, consider \(n = 3\):
- The program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  ```
- The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) would be \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), which has a size of 3.

However, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) as described in the problem's note is:
- Cells at positions (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1).
- The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) would be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4.

Thus, the program does not generate the optimal solution for all \(n\), making it incorrect.
