Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to check if it meets the requirements specified in the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the program step-by-step:

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program should handle multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it should take an integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \)).
3. It should output \( n \) points on an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
4. The Manhattan distance between cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is defined as \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

### Program Analysis:
1. The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each test case.
2. For each test case, it takes an integer \( n \).
3. The program prints "1 1" and "1 2" for the first two rows.
4. It then prints pairs "i i" for \( i \) ranging from 3 to \( n \).

### Verification:
Let's verify if this approach maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\):

- For \( n = 2 \):
  - Points: (1, 1) and (1, 2)
  - Distances: \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \) and \( |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 \) and \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
  - Set of distances: \{0, 1\}, which has size 2.

- For \( n = 3 \):
  - Points: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)
  - Distances: 
    - Between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
    - Between (1, 1) and (3, 3): \( |1-3| + |1-3| = 4 \)
    - Between (1, 2) and (3, 3): \( |1-3| + |2-3| = 3 \)
  - Set of distances: \{1, 3, 4\}, which has size 3.

- For \( n = 4 \):
  - Points: (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)
  - Distances: 
    - Between (1, 1) and (1, 2): \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
    - Between (1, 1) and (3, 3): \( |1-3| + |1-3| = 4 \)
    - Between (1, 1) and (4, 4): \( |1-4| + |1-4| = 6 \)
    - Between (1, 2) and (3, 3): \( |1-3| + |2-3| = 3 \)
    - Between (1, 2) and (4, 4): \( |1-4| + |2-4| = 5 \)
    - Between (3, 3) and (4, 4): \( |3-4| + |3-4| = 2 \)
  - Set of distances: \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}, which has size 6.

This pattern continues for larger values of \( n \), ensuring that the set of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for any given \( n \). Therefore, the program is correct.
