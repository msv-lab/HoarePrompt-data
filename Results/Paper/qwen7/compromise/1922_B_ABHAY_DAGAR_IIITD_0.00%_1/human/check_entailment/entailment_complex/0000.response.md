Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes the main function `func_1`.
2. Inside `func_1`, it iterates through each test case, reading the number of sticks `n` and their corresponding exponents.
3. It then constructs a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent.
4. The logic to calculate the number of ways to form a triangle is correct:
   - If there are at least 3 sticks with the same exponent, the number of ways to choose 3 out of these sticks is given by the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt-1) \times (cnt-2)}{6} \).
   - If there are at least 2 sticks with the same exponent, the number of ways to choose 2 out of these sticks and pair them with any other stick (which is counted by `total_count`) is given by \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times total_count = \frac{cnt \times (cnt-1)}{2} \times total_count \).
5. The results are stored in the `results` list and printed at the end.

Given the logical steps and the provided annotations, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
