Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `num_list` by mapping each element from the input string (split by spaces) to an integer using the `map` function. The original `results` list remains unchanged and is still an empty list. The `num_list` now contains integer values derived from the input.
