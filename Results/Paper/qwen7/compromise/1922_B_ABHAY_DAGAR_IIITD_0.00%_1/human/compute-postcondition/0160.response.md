Postcondition: `total_count` is `cnt` + 2, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, `res` is now `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * (`cnt` + 1) + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count`, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.

This postcondition summarizes that if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` will be updated to include an additional term involving `total_count`. If `cnt` is less than 2, the else part does not change the state, so the original values of `res` remain as specified.
