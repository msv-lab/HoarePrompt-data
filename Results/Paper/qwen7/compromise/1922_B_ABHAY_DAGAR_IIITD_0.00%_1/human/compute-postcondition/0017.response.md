Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `x` and the iterable `num_list`.

2. **Understand the Current State**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary containing the key `x` with a value of either 1 or 3.
   - `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one element, and the first element is `x`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the next element in `num_list`.
   - Since `num_list` has at least one element excluding the first element, which is `x`, the next element in `num_list` will be the current `x` from the previous iteration.

4. **Update the State**:
   - `x` will be set to the next element in `num_list`.
   - `num_of_lens` remains unchanged as it does not depend on the loop variable `x`.
   - `results` remains an empty list as the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `results` within the loop.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `x` is now the next element in `num_list`.
- `num_of_lens` remains the same.
- `results` remains an empty list.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary containing the key `x` with a value of either 1 or 3, and `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one element, and the next element in `num_list` is `x`.**
