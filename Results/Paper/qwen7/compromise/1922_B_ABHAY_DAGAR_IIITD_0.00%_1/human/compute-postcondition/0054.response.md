Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, and `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`.**

Explanation:
- `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary because all keys (integers from `num_list`) that had counts greater than or equal to 3 have been processed, reducing their counts until they are less than 3, and then they are removed from the dictionary.
- `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given. This includes the values accumulated from the formulae `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for each `cnt` that meets the respective conditions across all iterations.
- `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`, as it increases by the original value of `cnt` for each iteration.

Since the code snippet provided does not show the exact operations performed within the loop, the output state remains as described above, reflecting the changes made to the variables based on the given conditions.
