Output State: `results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from `num_list` is associated with the count of how many times that key appears in `num_list`, and `num_list` is a list of integers that has been fully processed.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain each unique number from `num_list` as a key, and the corresponding value will be the frequency of that number in the list. The `results` list remains empty as it was not modified within the loop.
