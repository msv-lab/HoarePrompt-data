Postcondition: `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0, provided that `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. If `cnt` is less than 3, the same conditions hold without any changes.
