Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`. `res` will be the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, which in this case seems to be the sum of counts of each integer in `num_of_lens`. `total_count` will be the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, representing the total count of all integers in `num_list`. `num_list` will be an empty list since it is modified within the loop by decrementing `test_cases` until it reaches 0, making the loop terminate. `test_cases` will be 0 as it gets decremented by 1 with each iteration until it runs out of elements in `num_list`.

In natural language, the final state will be that `num_of_lens` contains the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`, `res` is the sum of these frequencies, `total_count` is also the sum of these frequencies, `num_list` is empty, and `test_cases` is 0.
