Output State: **`total_count` is 0, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, `res` is `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. Since `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` will be a non-negative integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
