Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The `results` list remains unchanged and is still an empty list. The condition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 is not directly affected by this code snippet, so it is still valid.
