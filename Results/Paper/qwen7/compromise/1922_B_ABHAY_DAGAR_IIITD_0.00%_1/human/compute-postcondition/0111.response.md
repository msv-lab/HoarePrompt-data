Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(test_cases)`. The variables involved here are `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `res` is the sum of all calculated values from the loop.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`.
   - `total_count` is the sum of all values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `num_list` remains an empty list.
   - `test_cases` remains 0.
   - `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `test_cases` is currently 0, the loop will not execute again because the condition `test_cases > 0` is not satisfied.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed for the variables involved in the loop head (`test_cases`).

5. **Final State**:
   - The state remains the same as the current state since the loop will not execute again.

**State: **`res` is the sum of all calculated values from the loop, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`**
