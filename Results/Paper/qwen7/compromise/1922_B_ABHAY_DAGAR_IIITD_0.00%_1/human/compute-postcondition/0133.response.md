Output State: **`num_of_lens` contains the frequency of each integer in `num_list`, `res` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `total_count` is equal to the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()`, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.**

In this final state, the loop has iterated over every element in `num_list`, updating the frequency of each integer in the `num_of_lens` dictionary. The variable `res` holds the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, which is also reflected in `total_count`. The other variables (`num_list`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
