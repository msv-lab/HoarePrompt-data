State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(test_cases):`, which means the loop will iterate `test_cases` times.
2. The variable `_` is used as a throwaway variable, meaning its value is not used within the loop body. Therefore, we do not need to adjust the state of `_`.
3. The loop will only execute if `test_cases` is greater than 0. If `test_cases` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.
4. The initial state of `results` being an empty list does not affect whether the loop will execute or not.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `test_cases`, which must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
