Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` is associated with a value that is 1 more than its original value, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the first element of `num_list`.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. Since `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its corresponding value (which was initially 1 because `x` is the first element of `num_list`) is now incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
