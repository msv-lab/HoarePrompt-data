Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, `test_cases` is decremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and splits it into a list using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to `num_list`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `res`, `total_count`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged from their initial states. `test_cases` is decremented by 1 because the input operation has taken place.
