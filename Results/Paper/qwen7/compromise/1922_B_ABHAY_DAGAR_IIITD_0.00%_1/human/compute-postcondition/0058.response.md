Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, `test_cases` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `num_of_lens` as an empty dictionary. This means that the dictionary `num_of_lens` now contains no key-value pairs. The other variables (`res`, `total_count`, `num_list`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The `num_list` is expected to be populated with integers from input, but since no input has been provided yet, it remains as a list of integers obtained from input. The `test_cases` variable is decremented by 1, indicating that one test case has been processed or initialized.
