Output State: **`num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `res` is the sum of all calculated values from the loop, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code converts the input (which is expected to be space-separated integers) into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `num_list` is updated to contain these integers. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
