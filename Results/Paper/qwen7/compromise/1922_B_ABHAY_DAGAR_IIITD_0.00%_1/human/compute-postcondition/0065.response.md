Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the count of each key (integer from `num_list`) is incremented by 1 if the key already exists, otherwise a new entry with the key and a count of 1 is added. `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, `x` is an integer in `num_list`, and `test_cases` is decremented by 1.
