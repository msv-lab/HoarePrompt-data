Output State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one value, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens` after being decreased by 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and also increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, and `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increments the value of `total_count` by the current value of `cnt`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `cnt`, and `res`) remain unchanged according to the initial postconditions and the code provided.
