Output State: The `results` list will contain the final value of `res` for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, `results` will be a list where each element corresponds to the value of `res` after processing each test case. The `num_of_lens` dictionary will be recalculated for each test case, storing the frequency of each integer in the respective `num_list`. The `res` variable will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration and updated based on the conditions provided within the loop. The `total_count` variable will also be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration and updated as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`. The `n` variable and `test_cases` variable will retain their values from the last iteration unless new inputs are provided. After all iterations, `results` will contain the cumulative results for each test case processed.

In summary, `results` will hold the final computed values of `res` for each test case, while `num_of_lens` and `total_count` will be recalculated for each test case independently.
