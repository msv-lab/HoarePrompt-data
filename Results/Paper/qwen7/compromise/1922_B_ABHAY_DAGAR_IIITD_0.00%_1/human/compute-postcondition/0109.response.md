Output State: `res` is the sum of all calculated values from the loop, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`, `num_list` remains an empty list, and `test_cases` remains 0.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `res` will accumulate the results based on the conditions provided in the loop body. For each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, it adds `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to `res`. If `cnt` is also greater than or equal to 2, it further adds `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to `res`. The `total_count` is incremented by each `cnt` as the loop iterates through `num_of_lens.values()`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `num_list`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
