Output State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one value, `cnt` is decreased by 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, and `total_count` is increased by the original value of `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to the existing value of `res`. Given the initial conditions, `cnt` is decreased by 2, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` from the previous operations. Therefore, the new value of `res` is the sum of these two increments. The `total_count` remains increased by the original value of `cnt` as per the initial conditions.
