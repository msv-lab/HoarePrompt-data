Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary containing the key `x` with a value of 1, and `num_list` is a list of integers with the next element being `x`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num_of_lens[x]` to 1. Since `x` is either 1 or 3 (as per the initial state), the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is now 1. The other variables (`results` and `num_list`) remain unchanged.
