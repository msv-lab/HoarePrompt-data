Output State: **`i` is 29, `30` is the upper limit for the range function, and `(x & pow(2, i))` is False; `s` contains '0'**.

The code appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Since no other variables are affected, their previous states remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 29, the upper limit for the range function is still 30, and the condition `(x & pow(2, i))` remains False.
