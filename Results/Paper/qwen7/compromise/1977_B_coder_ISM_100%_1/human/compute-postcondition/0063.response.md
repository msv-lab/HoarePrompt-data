Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is an integer; `flag` is either 0 or 1; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '1'; `s[2]` is '-1'**.

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` updates the value of `s[2]` to '-1' because `i` is 2. The values of `i`, `x`, `flag`, `s[1]`, and `s[2]` are updated accordingly, while the rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.
