Output State: **`i` is 1; `flag` is either true or false; `s[i]` is '1'; `s[i + 1]` is not necessarily equal to '1'.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '1'` changes the value of `s[i]` from its original value (which could be '0' if `flag` was true, or any value not equal to '1' otherwise) to '1'. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
