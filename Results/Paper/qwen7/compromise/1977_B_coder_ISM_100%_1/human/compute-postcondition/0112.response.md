Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is 1, `nalla` is 30, `t` is greater than or equal to 30, `s` is a list with length 30 containing '0' at index 0, and the expression `(x & pow(2, i))` is False.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('0')` appends the string '0' to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially an empty list with a length of 30, after appending '0', the list `s` now contains '0' at index 0 and is still of length 30. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
