Output State: **`i` is between 0 and 28 (inclusive), `flag` is 0, and the value of `s[i]` is '1'.**

Explanation: The variable `flag` was originally set to `True`. After executing the line `flag = 0`, `flag` is now assigned the integer value `0`. The values of `i` and `s[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
