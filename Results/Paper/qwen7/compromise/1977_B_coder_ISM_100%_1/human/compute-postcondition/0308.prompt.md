Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `i` is 29, `flag` is either true or false, and each element in the list `s` is either '0', '1', or '-1'. If `flag` is true and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1'. If `flag` is false, the postcondition remains as specified in the else part, which is `flag` is true and `length` is 30.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 29, `flag` is either true or false, `length` must be at least 30, and each element in the list `s` is either '0', '1', or '-1'. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is changed to '0'. Otherwise, `s[i]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 30, `flag` is either true or false, `length` must be at least 30, and each element in the list `s` is either '0', '1', or '-1'. If `s[29]` is '-1' and `s[28]` is '1', then `s[29]` remains '-1'. If these conditions are not met, the state of the list `s` does not change.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 31, `flag` is either true or false, `length` must be at least 30, and each element in the list `s` is either '0', '1', or '-1'. If `s[30]` is '-1' and `s[29]` is '1', then the value of `s[30]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the conditions remain as per the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
