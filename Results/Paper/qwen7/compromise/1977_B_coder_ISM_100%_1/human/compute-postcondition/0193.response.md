Output State: **`i` is 2; `length` is 30; `s[1]` is '-1'**

Explanation: The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the element at index `i - 1` in the string list `s`. Given that `i` is 2, `i - 1` equals 1. Therefore, `s[1]` is now '-1'. The values of `i` and `length` remain unchanged, and the specific value of `s[2]` is updated to '0' as per the initial state.
