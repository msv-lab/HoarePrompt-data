Output State: **`i` is 29, `flag` is 1, and the character at index 29 of `s` is '1'**.

The code `s.append('1')` adds the character '1' to the end of the list `s`. Since the initial state specifies that the character at index 29 of `s` is '0', after appending '1' to `s`, the character at index 29 of `s` changes to '1'. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged.
