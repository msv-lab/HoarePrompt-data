Output State: **After the loop executes all 30 iterations, `i` will be 29, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. Each element in `s` is '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^i\) (where \(i\) ranges from 0 to 29) is true, and '0' otherwise; `flag` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `flag` to 0. No other operations are performed on `flag`, `i`, `x`, or `s`. Therefore, the values of `i`, `x`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `flag` is set to 0.
