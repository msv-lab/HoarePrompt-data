Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `m` and the range expression `range(m - 2)`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0. This means `m` must be at least 3 (as given in the initial state).

3. **Determine the Change in `m`**: Since the loop body is omitted, we don't know what happens inside the loop. However, the loop will continue to execute as long as `m - 2` remains positive. Therefore, `m` itself does not change within the loop body, but the loop will stop when `m - 2` is no longer greater than 0.

4. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be at least 3.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m - 2` must still be greater than 0. This means `m` must be at least 4.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `m` must be at least 4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be at least 4**
