Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is required to be met for changes to occur, and no such changes are mentioned to happen outside of the condition, the only effect of the `break` statement is to exit the loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged, and we simply note that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
