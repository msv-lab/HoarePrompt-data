Postcondition: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the second integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input corresponding to the second tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list of integers from `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
