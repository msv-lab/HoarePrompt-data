Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `idx1` is equal to `i`, `idx2` is equal to `i`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were, and `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` was previously incremented by 1, `idx1` and `idx2` now both hold this incremented value. The other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `n`) remain unchanged. The condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not relevant to the assignment operation and does not affect the values of the variables.
