Output State: **`m` is reduced by 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations, `t` is `t-1`, `a1` is the first integer input, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `a2` is the second integer input by the user, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `idx1` and `idx2` to -1. This does not affect the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `m`, `n`, `val`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, `l22` remain unchanged, and the new values for `idx1` and `idx2` are explicitly set to -1.
