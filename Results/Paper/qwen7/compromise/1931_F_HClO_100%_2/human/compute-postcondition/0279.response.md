Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is either `-1` or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not `-1` and is either `n - 2` or another valid index, and `val` is an empty list. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and `m` is equal to 2. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, and `m` within the `continue` statement, their values remain the same as they were in the initial state.
