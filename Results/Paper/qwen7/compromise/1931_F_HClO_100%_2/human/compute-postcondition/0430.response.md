Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer with the value 2, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts them to integers, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to `l3`. The other variables remain unchanged.
