Based on the initial state provided, the variables and their values are as follows:

- `i` is `n-2`
- `p1` and `p2` will either both be 0 or one of them will be 1 depending on whether a match was found
- `idx1` will be updated to the index where the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` was last satisfied, or it will remain -1 if no such index was found
- `idx2` is now `n - 2`
- `val` is an empty list
- `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`
- `m` is 2

The `print` statement simply outputs the string "yes". Since there are no variables or objects within the `print` statement itself that need further evaluation, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **yes**
