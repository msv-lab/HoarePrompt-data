Output State: **`val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, and for each tuple, `l3` is exactly the list of all elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. It does not affect the value of `val` or `t`. Therefore, the list of tuples in `val` remains unchanged, and `t` stays at 0.
