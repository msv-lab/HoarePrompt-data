Output State: **All variables in `val` are as follows: `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both `-1` or one of them is set to the final value of `i + 1` and the other remains `-1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both `0` or one of them is `1` based on the last comparison inside the loop, and `i` has reached `n - 1` or the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is met, leading to a break.**

This output state describes the final conditions of all variables after the loop has completed its iterations. The loop continues to increment `i` and update `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` based on the comparisons between elements of `l1` and `l2`. The loop breaks when `i` reaches `n - 1` or when the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is satisfied, ensuring that the loop does not exceed the bounds of the lists.
