Output State: **`a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples (`a3`, `l3`), `m` must be greater than 1**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Initially, `val` contains one tuple. After appending, `val` now contains two tuples. The values of `a3`, `l3`, and `m` remain unchanged.
