Output State: **`m` must be at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing one tuple (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to `l3` as a list. The precondition that `m` must be at least 3 remains unchanged. The `val` list, which initially contained one tuple `(a3, l3)`, now has this updated tuple with the newly converted integers.
