Output State: **`idx1` is equal to `i`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` plus the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, and in this case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Additionally, the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1` and index `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal, and the value at index `i + p1` in list `l1` is equal to `a2`.**

This output state reflects that the variable `idx1` has been assigned the value of `i`, while all other conditions and relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
