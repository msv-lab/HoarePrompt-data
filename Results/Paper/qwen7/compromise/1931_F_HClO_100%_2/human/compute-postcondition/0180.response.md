Output State: `m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, `val` is a list of tuples that must contain at least `m - 2` tuples, input values are taken from the user for each iteration of the loop and stored in the variable `input`.

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `m - 2` will still need to be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to run at least once. The list `val` will contain exactly `m - 2` tuples as it accumulates one tuple per iteration. Each iteration of the loop prompts the user for an input, and these inputs are stored in the variable `input` during each pass through the loop.
