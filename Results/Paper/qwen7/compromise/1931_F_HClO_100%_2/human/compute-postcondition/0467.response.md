Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the next tuple in `val` corresponding to the second tuple in `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `m`, `a3`, or `l3`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code, the variables retain their initial states, and the break statement is noted.
