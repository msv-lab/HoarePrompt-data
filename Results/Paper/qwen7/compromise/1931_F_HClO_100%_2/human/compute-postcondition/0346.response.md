Postcondition: `val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be at least 4 and the input() function waits for user input three times. If `l11` equals `l22`, no change occurs to the variables.
