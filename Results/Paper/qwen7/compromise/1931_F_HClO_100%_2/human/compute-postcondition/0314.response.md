Postcondition: `val` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, and the length of `val` is exactly `m - 2`. After executing the if-else block, the current state of `l3` is such that it either contains all elements of `l` that are not equal to `a3`, or we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
