Postcondition: **`val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer with the value 2, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`. If `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)`, then `l` is equal to `l1`, where `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`. Otherwise, `l` is equal to `l2`.**
