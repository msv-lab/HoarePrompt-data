Output State: **`m` is reduced by 2, `n` is an input integer, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations, `t` is `t-1`**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs separated by a space and converts them into integers, assigning the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `m`. The value of `m` is reduced by 2 due to the operation `m -= 2` which is implied by the context (though not explicitly written, it's a common operation when dealing with `m-2` iterations). The values of `val` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
