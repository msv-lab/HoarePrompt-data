Postcondition: `n` must be at least 1, `i` plus the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, and in this case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not met, no change occurs to the variables. Additionally, if the condition `(l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2])` is true, then the elements at indices `i + p1` in `l1` and `i + p2` in `l2` are not equal.
