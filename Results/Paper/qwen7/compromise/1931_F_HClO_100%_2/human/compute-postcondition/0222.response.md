Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` is defined as `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `n - 2`. The conditions and values of `n`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged from the initial state.
