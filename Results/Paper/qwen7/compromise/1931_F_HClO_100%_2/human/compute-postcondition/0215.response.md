Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` plus the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, and in this case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Additionally, the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1` and index `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal. If the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` is true, then `idx1` is equal to `i`, `idx2` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx2` is equal to `i`, `p2` is 1, and the if condition `(idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0)` is satisfied. The code `break` is executed, which means we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
