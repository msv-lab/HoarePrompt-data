Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`.
- The length of `val` is exactly `m - 2`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print('no')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'` without any reference to the contents of the `val` list or any other variables. Therefore, the output is straightforward.

Output: **no**
