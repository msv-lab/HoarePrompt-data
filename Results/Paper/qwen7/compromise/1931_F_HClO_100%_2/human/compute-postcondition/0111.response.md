Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `p1` and `p2` will either both be 0 (if no matches were found that satisfied the conditions in the loop), or one of them will be 1 (if a match was found and the corresponding index was updated). The value of `idx1` will be updated to the index where the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` was last satisfied, and `idx2` is now `n - 1` (since `idx2` is updated to `idx2 + 1` after the insertion). If no such indices were found, `idx1` and `idx2` will remain -1. `val` is an empty list. Additionally, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`.**

The code `l = l1` simply assigns the value of `l1` to the variable `l`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, or `val`. The only change is that the variable `l` now holds the same reference as `l1`. The condition that `idx1` is greater than `idx2` remains unchanged.
