Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, and `p1` and `p2` will remain unchanged. The loop will break either when `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or when `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is true. If `idx1` and `idx2` are both set (i.e., they are no longer negative), the loop will also break; `val` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `val`. Since no operations are performed on `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `l1`, or `l2`, their states remain unchanged from the initial state. The only new variable introduced is `val`, which is initialized as an empty list.
