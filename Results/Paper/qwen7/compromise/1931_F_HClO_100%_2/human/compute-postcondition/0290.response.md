Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is `-1`, `idx2` is either `n - 2` or another valid index, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, `l2` is a list with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l` is a reference to `l2`, `l2.index(a1)` is greater than or equal to `l2.index(a2)`**.

The code `l = l2` simply assigns `l2` to `l`. This does not change the values of any variables but creates a new reference `l` that points to the same list as `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
