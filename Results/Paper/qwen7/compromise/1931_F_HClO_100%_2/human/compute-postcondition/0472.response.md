Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a list of n distinct integers ranging from 1 to n, where n and k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and n ⋅ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function returns information about the authors of the screenshots based on the given conditions.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters but works with a list of integers representing screenshots. It checks the conditions on n and k and returns relevant information about the authors of these screenshots.
