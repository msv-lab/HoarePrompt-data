Output State: **`val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, and for each tuple, `l3` is exactly the list of all elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, and `l1` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, splits it into individual elements, converts them to integers, and assigns the first element to `a1` and the rest to `l1`. The initial state of `val`, `n`, `m`, and `t` remains unchanged.
