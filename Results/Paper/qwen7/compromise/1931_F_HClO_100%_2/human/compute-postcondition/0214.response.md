Postcondition: `n` must be at least 1, `i` plus the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, and in this case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Additionally, the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1` and index `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal. If the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` is met, then `idx1` is equal to `i`, and either `i + 2` equals `n - 1` with the elements at index `i + 1` in list `l1` and index `i + p2` in list `l2` not being equal, or the elements at index `i + 1` in list `l1` and index `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal. If the condition is not met, then `idx2` is equal to `i`, `p2` is 1, and the if condition `(idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0)` is satisfied.
