Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is either `-1` or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not `-1` and is either `n - 2` or another valid index, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is less than `idx2`; `l` is now equal to `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `l` being equal to `l2`, while all other variables retain their original values.
