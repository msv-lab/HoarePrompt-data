Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer before the execution of the code.
