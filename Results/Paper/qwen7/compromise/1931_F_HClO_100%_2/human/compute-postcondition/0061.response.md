Output State: **`idx1` is 1, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `idx1`. No other variables are affected, and the conditions related to `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be at least 2, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since `i` is 1, the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` cannot be evaluated without knowing the values of `p1`, `p2`, and `n`. The only change is that `idx1` is now 1.
