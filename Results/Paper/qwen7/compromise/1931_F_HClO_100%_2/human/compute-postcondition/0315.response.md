Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(a3, l3)` from the list `val`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `val`. Each element in `val` is a tuple containing an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: We need to consider the state of `a3` and `l3` at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Analyze the postcondition**: After executing the if-else block, the current state of `l3` is such that it either contains all elements of `l` that are not equal to `a3`, or we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these points, let's think through the adjustments needed:

- **`a3`**: The value of `a3` will change to the next tuple in `val` when the loop continues.
- **`l3`**: The value of `l3` will either remain the same (if no further processing was done inside the loop body) or might be modified based on the if-else block. However, since the exact modification is not specified, we assume it remains the same unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Since the loop will continue as long as there are elements in `val`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the current tuple `(a3, l3)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next tuple in `val`.

**State: **`val` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, and the length of `val` is exactly `m - 2`. At the start of the next iteration, `a3` is the next integer in the list and `l3` is the corresponding list of integers.**
