Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be at least 4, meaning `m` could be 4, 5, 6, etc.
- `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations.
- `a3` is the first integer from the input for each iteration.
- `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the input for each iteration.
- The current value of `l3` is not equal to a list of all integers in `l` excluding `a3`.

The print statement is simply printing the string `'no'`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `'no'` without any additional variables or values being included.

Output: **no**
