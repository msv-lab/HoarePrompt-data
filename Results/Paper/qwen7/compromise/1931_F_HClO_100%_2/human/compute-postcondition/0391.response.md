Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `i` is incremented by `1`.
   - `idx1` is equal to `i + 1`.
   - Either `p1` is `1` (if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`) or `idx2` is `i + 1` and `p2` is `1`.
   - If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by `1` at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus `1`.
   - `idx1` will be updated to the new value of `i + 1`.
   - The conditions involving `p1` and `p2` remain as they were unless the loop breaks due to the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`.

5. **Check the loop continuation condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

Given the above points, let's formulate the new state:

- The new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus `1`.
- `idx1` will be the new value of `i + 1`.
- The conditions involving `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged unless the loop breaks.

Since the loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`, we assume that the loop does not break at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `idx1` is the new value of `i + 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were, and `n` remains unchanged**.

To express this precisely:

State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `idx1` is the new value of `i + 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were, and `n` remains unchanged**.
