Postcondition: **`val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, and for each tuple, `l3` is exactly the list of all elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and `t` is 0; if `m` equals 1, we continue the loop or statement we were inside.**
