Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `idx2` is 0, `p2` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `p2 = 1` assigns the value 1 to `p2`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
