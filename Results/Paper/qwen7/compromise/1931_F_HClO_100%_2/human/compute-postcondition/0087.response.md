Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2 and `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i + p1`. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to `i + p2`. After executing the if-else block, either `idx1` is set to `i + p1` if the condition `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0` is true, or the loop or if statement we were inside is broken out of.
