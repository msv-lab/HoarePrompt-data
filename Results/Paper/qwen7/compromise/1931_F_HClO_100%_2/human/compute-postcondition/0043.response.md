Output State: **`idx1` is 0, `i` is 0, `p1` is 1, the current value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n` minus 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code `p1 = 1` assigns the value 1 to `p1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
