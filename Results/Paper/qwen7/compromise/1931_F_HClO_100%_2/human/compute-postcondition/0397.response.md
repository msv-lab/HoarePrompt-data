Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1; `idx1` is `i + 1`; `p1` and `p2` remain as they were; `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `idx1 = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `idx1`. This means `idx1` now holds the value of `i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now the previous value of `i` plus 1. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The condition `if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not relevant to the assignment of `idx1` and does not change the values of any variables.
