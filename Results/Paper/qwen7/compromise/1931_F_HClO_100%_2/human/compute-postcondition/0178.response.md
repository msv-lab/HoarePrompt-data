Output State: **`m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, `val` is a list of tuples that must contain at least `m - 1` tuples, an input value is taken from the user and stored in the variable `input`**.

Explanation: The code `input()` reads an input from the user and stores it in the variable `input`. The conditions on `m` and `val` remain unchanged.
