Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, and `m` is 1; `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`. The current state of `l11` is not equal to the current state of `l22`
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`, `m` is 1, `_` is 0, a new string input is taken but its value is not assigned to any variable.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`, `_` is 1, a new string input is taken but its value is not assigned to any variable.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` must be greater than 3, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`, `_` is 2, a new string input is taken but its value is not assigned to any variable.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
