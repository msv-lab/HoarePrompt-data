Output State: **`a3` is a new integer obtained from the first input split by spaces, `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs split by spaces, `i` is `n-2`, `p1` and `p2` will either both be 0 (if no matches were found that satisfied the conditions in the loop), or one of them will be 1 (if a match was found and the corresponding index was updated). The value of `idx1` will be updated to the index where the condition `l3[i + p1] == a1` was last satisfied, and `idx2` is now `n - 2`. If no such indices were found, `idx1` and `idx2` will remain -1. `val` is an empty list. Additionally, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, and the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l1` is a list that has inserted `a1` at the position `idx2`.**

In this output state, the list `l1` has had the element `a1` inserted at the position `idx2`. All other variables retain their previous states unless otherwise specified.
