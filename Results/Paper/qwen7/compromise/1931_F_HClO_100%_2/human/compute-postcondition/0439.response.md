Output State: **`val` is now ['(a3, l3)'], `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer minus 1 (i.e., `m-1`), `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`**.

This output state reflects that the value of `m` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
