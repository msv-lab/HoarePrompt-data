Output State: **`val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, and for each tuple, `l3` is exactly the list of all elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers from the input, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.**

The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` takes an input, splits it into a sequence of space-separated strings, converts them to integers, and assigns the first element to `a2` and the rest to `l2`. The initial values of `val`, `n`, `m`, `t`, `a1`, and `l1` remain unchanged.
