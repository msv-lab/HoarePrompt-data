Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `i` is 2**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `idx1`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 and the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` for breaking out of the loop or if statement remains unchanged because the code does not affect these conditions or variables. Therefore, the only change is that `idx1` is now 2.
