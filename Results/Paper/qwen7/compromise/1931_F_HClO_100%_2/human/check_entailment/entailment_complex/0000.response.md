Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m` (which should be `k`), followed by the two lists `l1` and `l2`.

2. **Initial Checks**: The program correctly handles the case where `m == 1` by simply printing "yes" since a single screenshot always matches the original order.

3. **List Comparison**: The program compares the lists `l1` and `l2` after removing the author's position (`a1` and `a2`). If the modified lists do not match, it prints "no" and continues to the next test case.

4. **Finding Insertion Points**: The program attempts to find the correct insertion points for `a2` in `l1` and `a1` in `l2`. This is done by iterating through the lists and identifying the first mismatched positions.

5. **Insertion Logic**: The program inserts the author's position into the appropriate list and then checks subsequent lists to ensure they match the modified list. If any subsequent list does not match, it prints "no".

6. **Final Output**: The program correctly prints "yes" if all lists match the modified list after insertions, and "no" otherwise.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided examples. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
