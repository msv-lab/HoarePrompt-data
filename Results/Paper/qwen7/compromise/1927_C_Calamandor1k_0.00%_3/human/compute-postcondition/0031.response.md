Output State: **`count_b` is 2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `count_b += 1` increments the value of `count_b` by 1. Given that `count_b` was initially set to 1, after executing this line, `count_b` becomes 2. The other variables (`i` and the condition about `b[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
