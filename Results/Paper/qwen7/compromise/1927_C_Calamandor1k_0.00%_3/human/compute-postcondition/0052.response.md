Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers, `b` is a list of integers from the new input split.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element into an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `b`. The variables `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
