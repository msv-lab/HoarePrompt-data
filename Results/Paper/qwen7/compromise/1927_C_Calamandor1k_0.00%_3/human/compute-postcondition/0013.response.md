Postcondition: **`count_a` is 1, `count_b` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `len_a`. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` is incremented by 1 and `count_b` remains unchanged.**
