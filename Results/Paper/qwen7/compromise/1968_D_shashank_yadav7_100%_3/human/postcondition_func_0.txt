The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \), and for each test case, it reads values for \( n \), \( k \), \( b \), and \( s \). It then takes a permutation \( p \) and an array \( a \) as inputs. The function calculates two values, \( bm \) and \( sm \), by iterating through the permutation and updating based on the values in the array \( a \). Finally, it compares \( bm \) and \( sm \) and prints either "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on their comparison.
