Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` retains this property. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`) remain unaffected and retain their initial conditions.
