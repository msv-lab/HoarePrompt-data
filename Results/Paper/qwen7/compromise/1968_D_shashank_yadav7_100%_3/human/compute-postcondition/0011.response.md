Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - From the given state, we know that `i` is currently 1.
   - We need to determine what value `n` should have for the loop to execute.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute if `n` is at least 1 (since `range(n)` includes numbers from 0 to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is already 1, it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
