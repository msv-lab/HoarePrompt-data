Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`**.

Explanation: The code updates `bm` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[b] * k + bp`. Given that `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[b] * 0 + bp`, which is just `bp`. Therefore, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `bp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
