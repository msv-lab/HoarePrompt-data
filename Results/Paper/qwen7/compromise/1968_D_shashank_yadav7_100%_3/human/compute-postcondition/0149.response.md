Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `k` is `k - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * (k - 1) + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * (k - 1) + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and the new value calculated as `a[s] * k + sp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
