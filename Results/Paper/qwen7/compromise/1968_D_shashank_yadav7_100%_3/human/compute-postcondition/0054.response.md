Postcondition: **After the execution of the if-else block, `i` equals `n`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[...p[b]...-1]-1] - (n-1)`, `s` is `p[p[...p[s]...-1] - (n-2)`, `bm` is the maximum value accumulated from the expression `a[b] * k + bp` during each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value accumulated from the expression `a[s] * k + sp` during each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for all iterations, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for all iterations, and the condition `bm > sm` holds if the if part is executed, otherwise `bm <= sm` holds.**
