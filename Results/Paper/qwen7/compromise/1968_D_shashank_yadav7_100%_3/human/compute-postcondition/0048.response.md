Postcondition: **The loop will continue to execute until `k` reaches 0. After all iterations, `i` will equal `n`, `k` will be 0, `b` will be `p[p[...p[b]...-1]-1] - (n-1)`, `s` will be `p[p[...p[s]...-1] - (n-2)`, `bm` will be the maximum value accumulated from the expression `a[b] * k + bp` during each iteration, `sm` will be the maximum value accumulated from the expression `a[s] * k + sp` during each iteration, `sp` will be the sum of `a[s]` for all iterations, `bp` will be the sum of `a[b]` for all iterations, and `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.**
