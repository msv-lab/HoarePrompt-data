Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k = -2`
   - `i = 0`
   - `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`
   - `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`
   - `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`
   - `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`
   - `b` is `p[b] - 2`
   - `s` is `p[s] - 2`
   - `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`
   - `bm` is updated to the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`
   - `sm` is updated to the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`
   - `bp` is increased by `a[b]`
   - `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`

2. **Operations:**
   - We need to determine the values of `bm` and `sm` after these operations. However, since the values of `a`, `b`, `s`, `p`, `bp`, and `sp` are not explicitly provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of `bm` and `sm`.

Given the operations and the fact that `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`, the print statement will simply output the string "Draw".

Output: **Draw**
