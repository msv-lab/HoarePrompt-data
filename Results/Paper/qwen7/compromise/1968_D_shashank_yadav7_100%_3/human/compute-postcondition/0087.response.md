Output State: **`k` is -1, `i` is `n - 2`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -1 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -1 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, and `sm` is updated to the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -1 + sp`**.

In more detail:
- `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, making it `bp + a[b]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
