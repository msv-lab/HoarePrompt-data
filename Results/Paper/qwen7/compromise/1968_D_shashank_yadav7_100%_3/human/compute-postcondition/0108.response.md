Postcondition: **k is -2, i is 0, bm is the maximum value between bm and a[b] * -2 + bp, sm is the maximum value between sm and a[s] * -2 + sp, sp is increased by a[s] + a[s], bp is increased by a[b] + a[b], b is p[b] - 2, s is p[s] - 2, and either bm is greater than sm or bm is not greater than sm (which is always true).**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. Regardless of whether the condition `bm > sm` holds true or not, the final state of the variables remains consistent as described.
