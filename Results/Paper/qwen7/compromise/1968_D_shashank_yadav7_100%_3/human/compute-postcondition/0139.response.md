Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `sm`, `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp`, the only change is that `sm` now holds the maximum of its original value and `a[s] * k + sp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
