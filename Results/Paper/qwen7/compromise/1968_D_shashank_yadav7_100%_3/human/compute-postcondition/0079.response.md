Output State: **`k` is -1, `i` is `n - 2`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * 0 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * 0 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or altered by the `break` statement, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
