Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `k = -2`
   - `i = 0`
   - `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`
   - `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`
   - `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`
   - `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`
   - `b` is `p[b] - 2`
   - `s` is `p[s] - 2`
   - `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`
   - `bm` is updated to the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`
   - `sm` is updated to the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`
   - The condition `bm > sm` holds true.

2. **Operations:**
   - `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`
   - `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`
   - `bm` is updated to the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`
   - `sm` is updated to the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`

Given that the condition `bm > sm` holds true, it implies that `bm` is already greater than `sm` after the updates. Therefore, the print statement will simply print the string "Bodya".

Output: **Bodya**
