Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + a[b]`**

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by `a[b]`. Since `b` is defined as `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, the value of `bp` is updated to `a[b] + bp + a[b]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
