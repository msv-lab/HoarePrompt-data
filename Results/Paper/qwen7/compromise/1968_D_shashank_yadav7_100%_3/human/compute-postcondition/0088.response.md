Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 2`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at `n - 2`, the next value of `i` would be `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to update `i` to `n - 1` for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State: **`k` is -1, `i` is `n - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -1 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -1 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, and `sm` is updated to the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -1 + sp`**
