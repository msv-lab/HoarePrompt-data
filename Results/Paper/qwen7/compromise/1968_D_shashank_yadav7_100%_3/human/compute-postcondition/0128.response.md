Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

The code updates the variable `sm` to be the maximum value between its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
