Postcondition: **k is -2, i is 0, bm is the maximum value between bm and a[b] * -2 + bp, sm is the maximum value between sm and a[s] * -2 + sp, sp is increased by a[s] + a[s], bp is increased by a[b] + a[b], b is p[b] - 2, s is p[s] - 2, sp is increased by a[s] + a[s], bm is updated to the maximum value between bm and a[b] * -2 + bp, sm is updated to the maximum value between sm and a[s] * -2 + sp, bp is increased by a[b], and the condition bm is greater than sm holds true.**
