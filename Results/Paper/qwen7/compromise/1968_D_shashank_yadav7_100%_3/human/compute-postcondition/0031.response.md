Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**.

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. Given the initial conditions, `i` remains 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, and now `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`.
