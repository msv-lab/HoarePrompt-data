Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers inputted from the user, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and then converts each string to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `p`. The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.
