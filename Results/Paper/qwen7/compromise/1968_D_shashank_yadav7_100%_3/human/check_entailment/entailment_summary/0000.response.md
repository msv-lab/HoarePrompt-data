Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary parameters (`n`, `k`, `b`, `s`) and the arrays `p` and `a`.
3. It adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.
4. It initializes `bm` and `sm` to represent the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
5. The program iterates through the permutation, updating the positions and recalculating the maximum possible scores for both players.
6. After the loop, it compares `bm` and `sm` and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

Given the detailed steps and the logic implemented in the code, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately. It handles the game logic correctly by considering the maximum possible scores for both players over the specified number of turns.

Correctness: **True**
