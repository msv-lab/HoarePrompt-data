Output State: **`s` is 0, `b` is an input string, `j` is the last index where `b[j]` equals '@', `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is the same as the initial value, `d` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `b = input()` replaces the current value of `b` with a new string input by the user. The other variables (`s`, `j`, `i`, `a`, `d`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `j` remains dependent on the updated `b`, which now holds the newly input string.
