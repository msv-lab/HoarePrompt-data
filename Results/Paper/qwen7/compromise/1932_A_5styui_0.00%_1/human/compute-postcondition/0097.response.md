Output State: **Postcondition: `s` is equal to the total number of '@' characters in the string `b`, `b` is the same non-empty string as the initial state, `j` is the last index where `b[j]` equals '@`, `d` is the input integer, and if `b[j + 1]` equals '*', the loop breaks; otherwise, it continues until all characters in `b` are checked.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `s` will hold the count of '@' characters in the string `b`. The variable `j` will be set to the index of the last '@' character found in `b`, or it will be set to the length of `b` minus one if there are no more characters to check. The variable `d` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop. If at any point during the loop, a '*' character is encountered followed by another '*', the loop will break prematurely.
