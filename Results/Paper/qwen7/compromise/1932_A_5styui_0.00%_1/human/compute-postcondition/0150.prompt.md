You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of n characters consisting only of '.', '@', and '*', where the first character is always '.', indicating an empty starting cell.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    s = 0
    for i in range(a):
        d = int(input())
        
        b = input()
        
        for j in range(len(b)):
            if b[j] == '@':
                s = s + 1
            elif b[j] == '*':
                if b[:]:
                    break
                elif b[j + 1] == '*':
                    break
        
        print(s)
        
        s = 0
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `s` will be the total count of '@' characters across all strings `b` provided during the loop's iterations, `i` will be equal to the final value of `a` (which is the number of iterations the loop executed), `a` will remain the same as its initial value, `d` will be the last input integer provided, and `b` will be the last non-empty string provided.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, along with a string of `n` characters consisting only of '.', '@', and '*', with the first character always being '.'. The function returns information based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
