Output State: **`s` is 0, `b` is the same non-empty string as the initial state, `j` is the last index where `b[j]` equals '@', `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is the same as the initial value, `d` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `d` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `d` now holds the integer value entered by the user. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
