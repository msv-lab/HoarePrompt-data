Output State: **`j` is 1, `b` is a non-empty string, `s` is an integer which is 1 more than the original value of `s`**

Explanation: The code `s = s + 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Since `s` was not initialized before this line, it is assumed to be an integer. The value of `j` and `b` remain unchanged.
