Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is 0, `b` is an input string, `j` is the last index where `b[j]` equals '@', `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is the same as the initial value, `d` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if b[:]:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is 1 if the character at index `j` in `b` is '@'; otherwise, `s` is 0. `b` is a non-empty input string, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is the same as the initial value, and `d` is an input integer. If the current character `b[j]` is '*', or the next character `b[j + 1]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, no changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is either `@` or `*`; otherwise, `s` is 0, `j` is incremented by 1, `b` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` remains the same as the initial value, and `d` remains the same as before.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is 2 if the character at index `j` in `b` is `@`; otherwise, `s` is 1 if the character at index `j + 2` in `b` is either `@` or `*`, `j` is incremented by 1, `b` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` remains the same as the initial value, and `d` remains the same as before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
