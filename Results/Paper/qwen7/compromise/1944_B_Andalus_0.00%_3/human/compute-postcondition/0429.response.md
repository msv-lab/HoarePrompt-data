Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is an integer.
- `sng` is a list where its first element has been printed 0 times, meaning it hasn't been printed yet.
- `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The print statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`. Here, `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is being printed twice with a space as the end character.

Given the information, `elem` must be the first element of `sng` because it is the only element mentioned that could be printed. Since `sng`'s first element has been printed 0 times, it means `elem` is the first element of `sng`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the first element of `sng` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem**
