Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `1`.
   - `i` is `i_end + 1` and less than `n`.
   - If `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains the element `lft[i]`.
   - Otherwise, `sng`'s list has been appended with `lft[i]` if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` will be `i_end + 2` (assuming `i_end` was the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `n` remains unchanged unless the loop modifies it, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` will be `i_end + 2` because `i` increments by `1` each time.
- `i` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to `1`, `i` is `i_end + 2` and less than `n`.**
