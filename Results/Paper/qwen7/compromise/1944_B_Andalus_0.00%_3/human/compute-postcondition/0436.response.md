Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty list, the size of `sng` is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of the variables `sng` or `ldb`, nor does it affect the condition that the size of `sng` is greater than or equal to `k`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it is inside.
