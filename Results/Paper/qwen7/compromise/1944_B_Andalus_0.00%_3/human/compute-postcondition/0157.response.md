Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` is `k` + `len(sng)`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`, `rgt` is the remaining elements of `lst` starting from index `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the slice of `lst` starting from index `n` to the variable `rgt`. This means `rgt` contains the elements of `lst` from index `n` to the end of the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
