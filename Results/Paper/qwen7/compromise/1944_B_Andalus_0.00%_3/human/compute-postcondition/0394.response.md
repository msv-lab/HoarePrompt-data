Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is a non-empty collection (excluding the first element from the previous iteration).
- The first element of `sng` is `elem`.
- `sz` is an integer less than `k + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

Given that `sng` is a non-empty collection and the first element of `sng` is `elem`, the print statement will output the value of `elem`.

Since `sz` is an integer less than `k + 1`, it does not trigger the break condition inside the loop or if statement, so `elem` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `elem`.

Output: **elem**
