Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `sng`. At the end of the previous iteration, `sng` is a non-empty collection, and the first element of `sng` is `elem`, and `sz` is an integer less than `k + 1`.

3. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain at least one element. Since `elem` was the first element of `sng` in the previous iteration, after processing `elem`, `sng` will now be the collection excluding the first element.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `sng` will now be the collection excluding the first element.
   - `elem` will be the new first element of the updated `sng`.

5. **Consider the Additional State Variable `sz`**: The variable `sz` is mentioned but not directly involved in the loop head. It should remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `sng` is a non-empty collection (excluding the first element from the previous iteration).
- `elem` is the new first element of the updated `sng`.
- `sz` remains an integer less than `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`sng` is a non-empty collection (excluding the first element from the previous iteration), the first element of `sng` is `elem`, and `sz` is an integer less than `k + 1`**.
