Output State: **`sng` remains the same, `sz` is equal to the previous value of `sz` + 1, `rdb` contains the elements that were printed up to the new value of `sz`, `lft` is a slice of `lst` containing the first `n` elements, `rgt` is a slice of `lst` containing the remaining elements starting from the `n+1` index.**

Explanation: The code `rgt = lst[n:]` creates a new slice `rgt` from the list `lst`, starting from the index `n` to the end of the list. The other variables (`sng`, `sz`, `rdb`, and `lft`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
