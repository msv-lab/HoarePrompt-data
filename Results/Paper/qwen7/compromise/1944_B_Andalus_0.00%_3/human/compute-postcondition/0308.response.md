Output State: **`ldb` is an empty list, `sz` is equal to the previous value of `sz` + 1, `rdb` contains the elements that were printed up to the new value of `sz`, `lft` is a slice of `lst` containing the first `n` elements, `rgt` is a slice of `lst` containing the remaining elements starting from the `n+1` index.**

Explanation: The line `ldb = []` initializes an empty list for `ldb`. The values of `sz`, `rdb`, `lft`, and `rgt` remain unchanged from their previous states.
