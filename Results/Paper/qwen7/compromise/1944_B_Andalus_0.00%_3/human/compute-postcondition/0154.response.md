Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` is `k` + `len(sng)`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `T`, `sng`, and `sz` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `T` remains as `T - 1`, `sng` remains as a non-empty sequence, and `sz` remains as `k` + `len(sng)`. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers entered by the user.
