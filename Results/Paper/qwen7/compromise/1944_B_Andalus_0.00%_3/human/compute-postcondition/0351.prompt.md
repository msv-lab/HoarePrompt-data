Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `ldb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `lft`, and `sng` will contain all elements from `lft` that are not part of any consecutive duplicates. The values of `sz`, `rdb`, `sng`, `lft`, and `rgt` will remain unchanged from their final values after the last iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and either `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[0]` (in which case `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[0]`), or `rgt[i]` is not equal to `rgt[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, and either `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[0]` (in which case `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[0]` appended with `rgt[3]`), or `rgt[2]` is not equal to `rgt[0]` (in which case `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[0]` appended with `rgt[3]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` must be at least 5, and `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[0]` appended with `rgt[3]` and now includes `rgt[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
