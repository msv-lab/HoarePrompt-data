Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for elem in ldb`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `ldb`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `ldb`. The variable `elem` takes the value of each element in `ldb` sequentially.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `elem` is the first element of `ldb`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is `k + 2`. Otherwise, no change is made to `sz`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `ldb`, the next value of `elem` will be the second element of `ldb`.
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `i = 1`.
   - The value of `sz` remains unchanged because the condition `k - sz >= 2` was not met in the previous iteration (since `elem` was the first element).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `elem` will now be the second element of `ldb`.
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `sz` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`elem` is the second element of `ldb`, `i` is 1, and `sz` is the same as before**.
