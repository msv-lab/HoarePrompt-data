Output State: **`rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`; `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[i]` appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Since `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` initially, the value being appended to `rdb` is the same as `rgt[i - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
