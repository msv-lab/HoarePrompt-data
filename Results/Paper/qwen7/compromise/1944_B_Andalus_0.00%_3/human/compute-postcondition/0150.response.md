Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` is `k` + 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `k + 1` to `k + 2`. The state of `sng` and the condition about breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remain unchanged.
