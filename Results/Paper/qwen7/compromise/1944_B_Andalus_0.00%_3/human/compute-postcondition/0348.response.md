Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be at least 5, and either `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[0]` (in which case `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[0]` appended with `rgt[3]` and now includes `rgt[i]`), or `rgt[2]` is not equal to `rgt[0]` (in which case `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[0]` appended with `rgt[3]` and now includes `rgt[i]`).**

Explanation: The code appends `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 4, `rdb` will include the value of `rgt[4]`. The conditions regarding the equality of `rgt[2]` and `rgt[0]` remain unchanged, and the list `rdb` now includes the new element `rgt[4]` based on the given conditions.
