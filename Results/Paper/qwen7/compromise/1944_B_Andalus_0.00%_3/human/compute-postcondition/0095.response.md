Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Determine the initial states**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the number of elements in `sng`.
   - `rdb` is an empty list.
   - `sz` is 2.
   - There is a condition to break out of the loop if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `sng`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, meaning the loop has already executed once.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - `elem` will now be the second element in `sng`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is the length of `sng`, which does not change within the loop.
   - `rdb` remains an empty list as there is no indication that it is modified within the loop.
   - `sz` remains 2 as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Consider the loop termination condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is incremented to 2 and `n` is the number of elements in `sng`, the loop will continue if `n > 2`.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `i` and `elem`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, `n` is the number of elements in `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is 2**
