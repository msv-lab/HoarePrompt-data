Postcondition: `sng` is a non-empty collection (excluding the first element from the previous iteration), the first element of `sng` is `elem`, and `sz` is an integer less than `k + 1`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the collection `sng` and the integer `sz` remain unchanged when `sz` is less than `k`.
