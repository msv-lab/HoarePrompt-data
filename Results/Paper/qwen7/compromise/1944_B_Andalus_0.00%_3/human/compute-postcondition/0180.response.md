Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `sng` has appended the value of `lft[3]`**

Explanation: The code `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the value of `lft[3]` is appended to `sng`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` is an integer greater than 1 is still valid.
