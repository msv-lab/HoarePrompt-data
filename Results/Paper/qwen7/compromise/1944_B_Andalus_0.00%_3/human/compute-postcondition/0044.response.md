Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[2]`**

Explanation: The code `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends `rgt[2]` to `rdb`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition that `n` must be at least 2 remain unchanged.
