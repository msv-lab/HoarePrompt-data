Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to the number of elements in `sng`.
- `rdb` will be an empty list.
- `sz` will be equal to the number of elements in `sng`.

The `print()` function without any arguments will print an empty line.

Output: **an empty line**
