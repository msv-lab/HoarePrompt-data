Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from the list `rgt` starting from the second element, and there are no specific requirements for the contents of `sng` as it is not mentioned in the provided loop and its conditions. `sz` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `elem` is the first element of `ldb`, `i` is 0, and if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is `k + 2`. Otherwise, no change is made to `sz`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `elem` is the second element of `ldb`, `i` is 1, and if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is incremented by 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is less than 2, no changes are made to `sz`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `elem` is the third element of `ldb`, `i` is 1, and if `sz` is increased by 2 and becomes greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is less than 2, `sz` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
