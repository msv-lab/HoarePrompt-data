Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sz` is 0, `sng` has had its first element printed 0 times, `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` as per the initial conditions.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if sz >= k:
        break
    if k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `sz` is an integer, `sng` has had its first element printed 0 times, and `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, the values of `sz`, `sng`, and `ldb` remain as they were before the if-else block executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `sz` is an integer, `sng` has had its first element printed 0 times, `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, the conditions remain as they were before the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sz` is an integer, equal to its initial value plus 2, `sng` has had its first element printed 0 times, and `ldb` remains unchanged from its initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
