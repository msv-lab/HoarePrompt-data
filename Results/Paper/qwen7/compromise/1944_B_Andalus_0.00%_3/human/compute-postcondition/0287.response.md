Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is an empty iterable.
- There are conditions involving `sz` and `k`, but no specific values for `sz` and `k` are given, so we cannot determine if the loops or if statements are executed.

Given the `print(elem, end=' ')` statement, we need to determine the value of `elem`.

Since `sng` is described as an empty iterable, it implies that there are no elements in `sng`. Therefore, `elem` must be undefined or not set to any value because it would come from an iterable that is empty.

Output: **elem (undefined)**
