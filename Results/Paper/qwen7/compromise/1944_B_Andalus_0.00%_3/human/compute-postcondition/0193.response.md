Output State: **`rdb` contains the value of `rgt[i - 1]` appended, and `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given the initial state where `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, appending this value to `rdb` means `rdb` now contains the value of `rgt[i - 1]` appended. The value of `rgt[i]` remains unchanged and is still equal to `rgt[i - 1]`.
