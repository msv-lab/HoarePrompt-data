Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `ldb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `lft`, and `sng` will contain all elements from `lft` that are not part of any consecutive duplicates. The values of `sz`, `rdb`, `sng`, `lft`, and `rgt` will remain unchanged from their final values after the last iteration of the loop.**

In more detail, the loop processes each element in `lft` from index 1 to `n-1`. For each element, it checks if it is equal to the previous element (`lft[i-1]`). If it is, the current element is added to `ldb`. If it is not, and the current element is not the second-to-last element (to avoid out-of-range errors), and it is not equal to the next element (`lft[i+1]`), the current element is added to `sng`. After processing all elements, `ldb` will hold all consecutive duplicates found in `lft`, and `sng` will hold all non-consecutive elements. The other variables (`sz`, `rdb`, `lft`, and `rgt`) will retain their state from the last iteration of the loop.
