Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - Either `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[0]` (in which case `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[0]`), or `rgt[i]` is not equal to `rgt[0]`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.

5. **Check the Condition for `rgt[i]`**:
   - For `i = 2`, we need to check the condition: either `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[0]` or `rgt[2]` is not equal to `rgt[0]`.
   - The value of `rdb` will depend on this condition, but since we are only adjusting the state, we don't need to specify `rdb` explicitly.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and either `rgt[2]` is equal to `rgt[0]` (in which case `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[0]`), or `rgt[2]` is not equal to `rgt[0]`**.
