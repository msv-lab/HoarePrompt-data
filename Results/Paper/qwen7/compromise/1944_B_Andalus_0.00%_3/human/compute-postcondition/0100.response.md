Output State: **`i` is 2, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, `n` is the number of elements in `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Since `sz` was initially 2, after executing this line, `sz` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`i`, `elem`, `n`, `rdb`) remain unchanged.
