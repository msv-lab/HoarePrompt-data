Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from the list `rgt` starting from the second element, and there are no specific requirements for `ldb` and `sng` as they are not mentioned in the provided loop. 

In more detail, the variable `i` will take the final value of `n` (since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`). The list `rdb` will include all elements from `rgt` that are the same as their preceding element, starting from the second element of `rgt` until the end. Variables `ldb` and `sng` are not modified by the given loop, so their states remain as they were before the loop started.
