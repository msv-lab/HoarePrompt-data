Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` is a non-empty list.
- The size of `ldb` (denoted as `sz`) is less than `k`.
- `k - sz` is at least 2.

From this, we can deduce the following:

- Since `ldb` is non-empty, it has at least one element.
- The size of `ldb` (`sz`) is less than `k`, meaning `sz` could be any number from 1 up to `k-1`.
- Given that `k - sz` is at least 2, `sz` must be less than or equal to `k-2`.

However, the specific values of `elem` are not provided. Since no specific `elem` is mentioned in the initial state, we can only assume that `elem` refers to an element within the list `ldb`. But without knowing the exact value of `elem`, we cannot specify a particular element.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

This will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **elem elem** (where `elem` is an element from the list `ldb`).
