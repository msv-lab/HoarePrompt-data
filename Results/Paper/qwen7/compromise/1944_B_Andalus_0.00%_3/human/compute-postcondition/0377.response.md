Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` is a non-empty list with the same size as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- Either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print(elem, elem, end=' ')
```

Here, `elem` is a variable that holds a value from the list `ldb`. Since no specific value for `elem` is provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem`. However, we know that `elem` must be one of the elements in the list `ldb`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space. The `end=' '` argument ensures that there is a space after the second `elem` rather than a newline.

Output: **elem elem** (where `elem` is an element from the list `ldb`)
