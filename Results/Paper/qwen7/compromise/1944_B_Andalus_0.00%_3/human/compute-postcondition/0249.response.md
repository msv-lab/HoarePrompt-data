Output State: **`sz` is `sz` + 2, `sng` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The initial state is given as `sz` is `sz` + 1, `sng` must have at least one element, `elem` is the first element of `sng`, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The code snippet `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Therefore, `sz` changes from `sz` + 1 to `sz` + 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
