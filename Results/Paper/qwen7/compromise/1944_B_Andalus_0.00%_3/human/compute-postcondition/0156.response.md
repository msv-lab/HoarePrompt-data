Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `sng` is a non-empty sequence, `sz` is `k` + `len(sng)`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code `lft = lst[:n]` slices the list `lst` to include the first `n` elements and assigns it to the variable `lft`. The other variables remain unchanged.
