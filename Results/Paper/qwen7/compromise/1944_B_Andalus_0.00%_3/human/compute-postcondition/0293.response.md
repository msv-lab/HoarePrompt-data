Based on the initial state provided, we know that `sng` is an empty iterable, and `sz` is incremented by 1, making `sz = sz + 1`. However, since no specific value for `sz` or `k` is given, we cannot determine the exact value of `sz` or whether the if condition would be met. 

Given the code snippet:
```python
print(elem, end=' ')
```

Since `elem` is not defined in the initial state, and there's no context about how `elem` is assigned, we can only assume that `elem` is a variable that holds some value that needs to be printed. Without further information, we can only describe it in a general form.

Output: **elem (where elem is the value that needs to be printed)**
