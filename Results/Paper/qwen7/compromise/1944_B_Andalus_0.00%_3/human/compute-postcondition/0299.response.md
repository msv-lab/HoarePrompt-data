Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is `sz` + 1, meaning `sz` has been incremented by 1.
- `sng` must contain at least one element.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `sz` is less than `k`, no additional action is taken regarding the loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`.

However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. Given that `sng` contains at least one element, let's assume `elem` refers to the first element of `sng` (since it's the only element mentioned).

Output: **elem (where elem is the first element of sng)**
