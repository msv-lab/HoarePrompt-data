Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 2 or 4.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one fewer element than before.
- The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The print statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.

From the information given, we know that `elem` is a variable that holds a value from the iterable `rdb`. Since `rdb` is a non-empty iterable and it has one fewer element than before, the value of `elem` must be the last element of `rdb` before the iterable was modified.

However, the exact value of `elem` is not specified, but we know it is the last element of `rdb`. Therefore, the print statement will output this last element twice, separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem** (where `elem` is the last element of the iterable `rdb`)
