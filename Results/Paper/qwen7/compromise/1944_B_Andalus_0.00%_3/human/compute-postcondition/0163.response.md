Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range definition `range(1, n)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be set to 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Check if the initial state of other variables affects the loop execution**: The other variables (`sng`, `sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`) do not directly affect whether the loop can execute based on the given loop head. However, they might influence the behavior inside the loop body, but since we are only adjusting the state for the loop to execute, we don't need to change these variables.

Given the above analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. We need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 1 and that `i` remains less than `n` throughout the loop iterations.

**State:**
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer such that the loop can execute (i.e., `n > 1`)

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer such that `n > 1`**.
