Postcondition: `sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, and the current element being processed is the next element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the if part.
