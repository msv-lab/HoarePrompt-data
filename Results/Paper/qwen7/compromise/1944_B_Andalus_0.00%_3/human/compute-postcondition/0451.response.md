Based on the initial state described, `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`. The condition `sz >= k` is true, so the most internal loop or if statement is broken, but this does not affect the value of `elem` since it is not mentioned in the condition or any operation. Therefore, `elem` retains its initial value, which is not specified but implied to be a value that will be printed.

Output: **elem**
