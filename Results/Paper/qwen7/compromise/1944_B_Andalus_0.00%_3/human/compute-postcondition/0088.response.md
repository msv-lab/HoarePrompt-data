Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in `sng`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `sz += 1` increments the value of `sz` by 1. Initially, `sz` is 0, so after executing this line, `sz` becomes 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `rdb` remain unchanged. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement as mentioned in the initial state.
