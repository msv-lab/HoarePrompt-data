The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer t indicating the number of subsequent test cases, a positive integer n indicating the size of a list, and a list a of n non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of specific combinatorial values based on the frequency of each unique integer in the list a. Specifically, it adds the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the frequency of each integer if the frequency is 3 or more, and the product of the number of ways to choose 2 elements from the frequency of each integer and the sum of frequencies of other integers if the frequency is 2. The function outputs the accumulated sum for each test case.
