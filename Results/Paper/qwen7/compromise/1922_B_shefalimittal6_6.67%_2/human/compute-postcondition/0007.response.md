Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `x` which iterates over the list `nums`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the list `nums`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is 1.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `nums`, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list `nums`.
   - The list `nums` itself should still have at least one element for the loop to continue executing.
   - The dictionary `num_of_lens` will be updated with the new value of `x` as its key and the value will remain 1.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `nums` must still have at least one element.
   - `x` will be the next element in the list `nums`.
   - `num_of_lens` will have the key `x` and the value 1.

Based on these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is 1**.
