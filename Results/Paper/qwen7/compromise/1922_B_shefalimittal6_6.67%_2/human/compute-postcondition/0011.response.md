Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is 3, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, and `x` is the next element in the list.**

Explanation: 
- The code updates the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by adding 1 to the current value of `num_of_lens.get(x, 0)`. Since `num_of_lens` initially had a key `x` with a value of 2, after executing the line `num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1`, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` becomes 3.
- The variables `nums` and `x` remain unchanged from the previous state, as the loop body did not modify them. Therefore, `nums` must still have at least two elements, and `x` is the next element in the list `nums`.
