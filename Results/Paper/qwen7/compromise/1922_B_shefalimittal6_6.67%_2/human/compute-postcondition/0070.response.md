Output State: **`num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, and `total_sum` remains the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.

Explanation: The code `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` increases the value of `res` by the result of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `total_sum`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The precondition that `num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt` >= 2) or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if `cnt` < 2), and `total_sum` remains the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` is still valid.
