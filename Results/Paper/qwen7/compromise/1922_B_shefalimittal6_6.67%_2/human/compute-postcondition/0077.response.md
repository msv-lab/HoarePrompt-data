Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over `cnt` which is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`. Therefore, the only variables involved in the loop head are `cnt`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: 
   - `num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair.
   - `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `total_sum` is now the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`.
   - `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, it means that `cnt` will be the next key-value pair's value in `num_of_lens`.
   - `num_of_lens` still contains at least one key-value pair.
   - `total_sum` will be recalculated excluding the current `cnt`.
   - `res` will be updated based on the condition if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `num_of_lens` still contains at least one key-value pair.
- `total_sum` will exclude the current `cnt` from its calculation.
- `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `total_sum` is now the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the current `cnt`, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.
