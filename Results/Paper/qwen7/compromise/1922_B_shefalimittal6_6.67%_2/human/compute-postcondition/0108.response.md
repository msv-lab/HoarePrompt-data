Postcondition: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one entry, `res` is the original value of `res` plus the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, and `nums` remains unchanged. The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.
