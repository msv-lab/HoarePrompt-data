Output State: **`cnt` is an integer, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3; `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the `total_sum` by summing up all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`. The values of `cnt` and `res` remain unchanged unless `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, in which case `res` would be updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 3)`. The precondition that `cnt` is an integer and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 remains valid.
