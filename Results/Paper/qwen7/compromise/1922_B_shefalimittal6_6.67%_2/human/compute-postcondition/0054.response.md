Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `nums`. The variable `x` takes the value of each element in `nums` during each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens[x]` is 2 (This is not directly relevant to the loop head but might be useful for context).
   - `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `x` is the first element of `nums`.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be the second element of `nums`.
   - `nums` remains the same list of integers.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `num_of_lens[x]` is not directly affected by the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `nums` remains the same list of integers.
   - `x` changes to the second element of `nums`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is 2, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is the second element of `nums`**
