Postcondition: `num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if `cnt` >= 3) or `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt` < 3), and `total_sum` remains the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
