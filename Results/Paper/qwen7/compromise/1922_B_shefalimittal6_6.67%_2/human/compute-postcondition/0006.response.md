Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, num_of_lens is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is 1.**

Explanation: The code `num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1` increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Since `x` is an element from the list `nums`, the dictionary `num_of_lens` now contains a key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is 1 (initially 0 + 1). All other elements of the initial state remain unchanged.
