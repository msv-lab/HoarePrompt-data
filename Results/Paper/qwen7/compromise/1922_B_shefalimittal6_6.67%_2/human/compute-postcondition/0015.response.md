Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`. The only variable involved here is `cnt`.

2. **Determine the source of `cnt`**: The variable `cnt` takes values from `num_of_lens.values()`. This means `cnt` will take on the values of the counts stored in the dictionary `num_of_lens`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value. If `num_of_lens` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Initial state**: The initial state given is that `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original `nums` list and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `nums`, and `res` is 0.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on `num_of_lens` having at least one value, we need to ensure that `num_of_lens` is not empty. Additionally, since `cnt` is just a value from `num_of_lens.values()`, we don't need to specify the exact value of `cnt` initially; we only need to ensure that there is at least one value in `num_of_lens`.

6. **Final state**: Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure that `num_of_lens` contains at least one value.

**State:**
**`num_of_lens` must contain at least one value, res is 0**
