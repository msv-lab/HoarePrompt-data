Output State: The final value of `res` is the sum of all updates made to it during the loop's execution. For each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Additionally, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is further incremented by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all other values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.

In simpler terms, `res` accumulates based on the combinatorial calculations derived from the counts of each unique integer in the `nums` list, considering both the individual counts and their interactions with other counts.
