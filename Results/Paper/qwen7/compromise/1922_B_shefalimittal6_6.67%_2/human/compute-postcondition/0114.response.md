Output State: **`nums` remains a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is updated by adding the value of math.comb(cnt_next, 3)`**

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding the value of `math.comb(cnt_next, 3)`. Since `cnt_next` is the next value of `cnt` in the iteration, it will be either greater than or equal to 2 or less than 2. If `cnt_next` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` will be updated accordingly. If `cnt_next` is less than 2, `res` will remain unchanged. The values of `nums` and `num_of_lens` remain the same as they were before the code execution.
