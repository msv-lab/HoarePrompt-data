Output State: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer, with each integer's count being incremented by 1 for every occurrence in the list `nums`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain each unique integer from the list `nums` as a key, and the corresponding value will be the total count of how many times that integer appears in the list `nums`. The variable `x` will no longer be relevant since the loop has completed, and `nums` will remain as it was initially provided by the user.
