Output State: **The final value of `res` will be the sum of all updates made to it during the loop executions. Specifically, for each unique integer `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that appears 3 or more times, `res` will be increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. For each unique integer `cnt` that appears 2 or more times, `res` will be increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `res` will reflect the cumulative effect of all the combinatorial calculations performed based on the counts of integers in `nums`.
