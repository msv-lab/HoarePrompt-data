Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original `nums` list and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `nums`, `res` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0. This does not affect the dictionary `num_of_lens`, which remains unchanged from its initial state. Therefore, the dictionary `num_of_lens` retains its original state where each key is an integer from the original `nums` list and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `nums`. The variable `res` is now set to 0.
