Output State: The `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain the count of each unique integer from the `nums` list. Specifically, the key will be each unique integer from `nums`, and the value will be the count of how many times that integer appears in the list. The `nums` list itself remains unchanged, and `x` will be the last element of `nums` after the loop completes.

For example, if `nums` was `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `num_of_lens` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}` after the loop completes.
