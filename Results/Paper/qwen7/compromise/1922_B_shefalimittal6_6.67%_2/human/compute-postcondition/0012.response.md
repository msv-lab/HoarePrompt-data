Output State: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original `nums` list and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `nums`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `num_of_lens` will contain an entry for every unique integer in `nums`, with the value being the frequency of that integer in the list. The list `nums` itself remains unchanged from its initial state.
