Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, res is the sum of the combinatorial sums based on the counts of integers in nums, t is decremented by 1; n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes `num_of_lens` as an empty dictionary. This operation does not affect the values of `res`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
