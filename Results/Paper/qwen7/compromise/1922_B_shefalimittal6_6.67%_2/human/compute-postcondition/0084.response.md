Postcondition: `num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the current `cnt`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.
