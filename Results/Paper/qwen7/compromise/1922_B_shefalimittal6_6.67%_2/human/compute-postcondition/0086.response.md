Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain the count of each integer found in the `nums` list. The variable `res` will be the sum of:

- `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, with `total_sum` being the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`.

In simpler terms, `res` will accumulate the combinatorial sums based on the counts of integers in `nums`, considering all possible combinations of 3 elements and pairs, as long as their counts meet the specified conditions. The `num_of_lens` dictionary will reflect the final count of each unique integer from the `nums` list after all iterations of the loop.
