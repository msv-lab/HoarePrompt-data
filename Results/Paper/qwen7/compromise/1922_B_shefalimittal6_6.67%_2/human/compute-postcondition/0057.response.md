Output State: The `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain counts of each integer found in the `nums` list. Specifically, the key-value pairs will represent each unique integer from the `nums` list as keys, and their respective counts as values. For example, if `nums` was `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `num_of_lens` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}`. The `nums` list itself will remain unchanged from its initial state, and `x` will be the last element of `nums` after the loop completes.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `num_of_lens` will hold the frequency count of each integer present in the original `nums` list.
