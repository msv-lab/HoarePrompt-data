Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in nums:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens[x]` is 1 (This is not directly related to the loop head but might be relevant for the loop body).
   - `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `x` is not yet defined.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `nums`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the variable being iterated over, it will take on the value of the next element in `nums`.
   - `nums` remains the same unless modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, it stays as a list of integers entered by the user.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must still contain at least one element, and `x` will be set to the first element of `nums` for the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `num_of_lens[x]` is 1 (unchanged from the previous state).
   - `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user (unchanged from the previous state).
   - `x` will be the first element of `nums` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `num_of_lens[x]` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is the first element of `nums`**
