Output State: **`res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, `total_sum` is now the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the current `cnt`, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.

This means that the value of `res` has been updated by adding the result of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to its previous value. The values of `total_sum` and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states, with `total_sum` being the sum of the values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the current `cnt`, and `cnt` being the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
