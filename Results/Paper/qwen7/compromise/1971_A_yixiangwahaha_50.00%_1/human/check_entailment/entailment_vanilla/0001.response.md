### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem states that there will be `t` test cases, where `t` is provided as the first input. However, the given code reads `t` as a single input without specifying it as an integer, and then it processes 10 pairs of integers regardless of the value of `t`. This means the code does not correctly handle the number of test cases specified by `t`.

2. **Loop Iteration**: The code uses a fixed loop `for i in range(10)` to process 10 pairs of integers. This is incorrect because the number of test cases can vary from 1 to 100, as per the problem statement.

3. **Comparison and Output**: The logic for comparing and printing the minimum and maximum values of each pair is correct. However, since the loop iterates 10 times regardless of the actual number of test cases, this part of the code is also incorrect.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
