Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The problem states that the first line will contain the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent line will contain two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. However, the given program assumes there will be exactly 10 test cases hard-coded in a loop, which is incorrect.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x = int(xylist[0])
        y = int(xylist[1])
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)

func()
```

This version correctly reads the number of test cases from the input and processes each test case individually according to the problem description.
