You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

- Program: 
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 100; `x` is a list containing 10 integers; `y` is a list containing 10 integers.
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will compare each pair of elements from lists `x` and `y`, and print the smaller value followed by the larger value for each comparison. Since the initial values of `x` and `y` are not specified, the exact printed output cannot be determined without those values. However, the output will consist of 10 lines, each showing two numbers separated by a space, where the first number is the smaller of the two compared numbers from `x` and `y` at the same index, and the second number is the larger one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` and two lists of integers `x` and `y` from the user. It then compares the corresponding elements of `x` and `y` for 10 pairs and prints each comparison result, showing the smaller value followed by the larger value for each pair. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The problem states that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` lines each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. However, the program reads `t` from the first line but then attempts to read 10 pairs of integers regardless of the value of `t`. This will lead to incorrect behavior for inputs where `t` is not equal to 10.

For example, if the input is:
```
5
1 9
8 4
1 4
3 4
2 0
```
The program will incorrectly process 10 pairs of integers instead of just 5, leading to wrong outputs for the additional 5 pairs that do not exist in the input.
