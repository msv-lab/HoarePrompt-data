Reasoning:
- The problem description states that the input consists of an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of integers.
- The provided program reads `t` as a single integer but then processes only 10 pairs of integers (`x` and `y`) in a fixed loop.
- The program's logic correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values for each pair and prints them in the required format.
- However, the program does not handle the dynamic number of test cases as specified by `t`. Instead, it always processes exactly 10 pairs, regardless of the value of `t`.

Given this analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem specification of handling a variable number of test cases based on the input `t`.

Correctness: **False**
