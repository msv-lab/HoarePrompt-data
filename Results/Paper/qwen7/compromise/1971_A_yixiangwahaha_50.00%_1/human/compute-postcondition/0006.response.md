Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(10)`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The `range(10)` function generates numbers from 0 to 9. Therefore, when the loop starts, `i` should be 0.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10. Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, it will definitely execute 10 times.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop. The other variables (`t`, `x`, and `y`) do not affect the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0**
