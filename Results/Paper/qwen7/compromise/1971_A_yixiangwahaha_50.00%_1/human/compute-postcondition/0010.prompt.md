You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 100; `x` is a list containing 10 integers; `y` is a list containing 10 integers.
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will compare each pair of elements from lists `x` and `y`, and print the smaller value followed by the larger value for each comparison. Since the initial values of `x` and `y` are not specified, the exact printed output cannot be determined without those values. However, the output will consist of 10 lines, each showing two numbers separated by a space, where the first number is the smaller of the two compared numbers from `x` and `y` at the same index, and the second number is the larger one.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on predefined conditions involving an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
