Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and `n` is the length of `array`, and `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1.**

The code initializes two variables, `l` and `r`, to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively. These values do not affect the initial state of `array`, `n`, or `find`. Therefore, those variables retain their original states.
