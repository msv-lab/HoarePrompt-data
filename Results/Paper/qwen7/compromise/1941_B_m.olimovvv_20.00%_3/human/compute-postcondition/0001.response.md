Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses printed to the console based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if the first element of the array `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of the array `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.
