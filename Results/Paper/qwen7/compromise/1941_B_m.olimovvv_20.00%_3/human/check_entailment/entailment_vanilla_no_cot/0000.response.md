Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution checks only the first and last elements of the array with specific conditions but does not cover all the necessary conditions to determine if all elements can be made zero. The logic is incomplete and may fail for certain cases.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sum of all elements in the array is even because each operation reduces the sum of the array by exactly 4 (since \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\)). Additionally, we need to check if the array can be reduced to zeros through the specified operations.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the total sum of the array is divisible by 4
        if sum(b) % 4 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the first and last elements meet the required conditions
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2:
            print('NO')
            continue
        if b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # If all checks pass, it is possible to make all elements zero
        print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum of the array is divisible by 4 and checks the specific conditions for the first and last elements, which are necessary for the operations to be applied successfully.
