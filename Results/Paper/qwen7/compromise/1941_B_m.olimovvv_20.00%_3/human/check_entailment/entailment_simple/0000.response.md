Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. The key logic in the program checks two conditions:
   - If the first element of the array is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2.
   - If the last element of the array is odd and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2.
4. If either of these conditions is true, the program prints 'NO'.
5. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The conditions checked do not fully capture the necessary criteria to determine if all elements can be made zero. Specifically, the conditions only check the first and last elements, but they do not consider the overall structure of the array and whether the sum of the array elements is even (since each operation reduces the sum by 4).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the sum of the array elements is even and that no element is isolated in a way that makes it impossible to reduce to zero using the given operations. The current logic does not account for these broader constraints.

Given the flawed logic, the provided solution will not always give the correct answer.

Correctness: **False**
