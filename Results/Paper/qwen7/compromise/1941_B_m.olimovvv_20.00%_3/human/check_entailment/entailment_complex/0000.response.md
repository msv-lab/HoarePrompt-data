Reasoning:
The given solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The solution only checks the first and last elements of the array against certain conditions, which is insufficient to determine the overall possibility of making all elements zero.

Here's why the current solution is incorrect:
1. The solution only checks the first and last elements of the array, which is not sufficient to determine if all elements can be made zero.
2. The solution does not consider the intermediate elements and their relationships with each other.
3. The operations allow modifying three consecutive elements in a specific way, and the solution should account for the cumulative effect of these operations across the entire array.

A correct approach would involve checking if the sum of the array elements is even (since each operation reduces the sum by 4) and ensuring that the array can be reduced to zeros through a series of valid operations.

Given the provided annotated program, the solution is incorrect because it fails to address the core logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
