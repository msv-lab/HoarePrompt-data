### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Input:** 
     - `n`: Integer, length of the input string `a`.
     - `a`: String consisting of '0' and '1'.
   - **Process:**
     - Constructs a list `S` where each element `[x, y]` represents the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to the current character in `a`.
     - Iterates through the list `S` to find the optimal position `i` such that:
       - At least half of the residents on the left side are satisfied (`left * 2 >= lsum`).
       - At least half of the residents on the right side are satisfied (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
     - Updates `ans` to store the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2`.
   - **Output:** 
     - Prints the optimal position `i`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Input:**
     - Reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - **Process:**
     - Calls `func_1` `t` times.
   - **Output:**
     - No explicit output, but `func_1` prints the result for each test case.

3. **Overall Program Behavior:**
   - The program correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1` and ensuring that the string `a` remains unchanged.
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the problem requirements:
     - It calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's.
     - It checks the conditions for satisfaction on both sides.
     - It finds the optimal position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference from `n/2`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution for the problem statement. All functions together ensure that the program meets the problem requirements and produces the correct output for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
