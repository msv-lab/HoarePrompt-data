Output State: `a` is an input string consisting only of '0' and '1', and `n` is the length of the input string `a`; `S` is a list containing sublists where each sublist contains two integers, with the first integer representing the count of '0's encountered in `a` up to the current character, and the second integer representing the count of '1's encountered up to the current character; `ans` is the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` while satisfying the condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, where `left` is the count of '0's up to index `i`, `lsum` is the index `i`, `right` is the count of '1's from index `i+1` to the end, and `rsum` is the remaining length of the string from index `i+1` to the end.
