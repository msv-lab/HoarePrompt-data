Output State: `a` is an input string consisting only of '0' and '1', and `n` is the length of the input string `a`; `S` is a list containing sublists where each sublist contains two integers, with the first integer representing the count of '0's encountered in `a` up to the current character, and the second integer representing the count of '1's encountered up to the current character; `ans` is the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2`, subject to the condition that the number of '0's seen so far is at least half the number of characters seen so far, and the number of '1's remaining is at least half the number of characters remaining.
