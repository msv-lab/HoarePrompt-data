Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 (since `range(n + 1)` generates values from 0 to `n` inclusive).

3. **Determine the value of `n`**: The value of `n` is given as the length of the input string `a`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will always execute at least once, but it will stop when `i` reaches `n + 1`.

Given this information, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. The initial state of `i` should be 0, and `n` should be the length of the string `a`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `i` is 0, `n` is the length of the input string `a`**
