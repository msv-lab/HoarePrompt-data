Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `hd` is `hd - 2`, `s1` and `s2` are strings, and `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since there is no loop context provided, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as their initial states.
