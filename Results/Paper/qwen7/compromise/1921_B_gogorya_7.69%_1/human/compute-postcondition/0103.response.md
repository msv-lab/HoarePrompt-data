Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `hd` is `hd - 2`, `s1` and `s2` are strings, and `res` is either `res + 1` if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', or `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `hd -= 1` decrements the value of `hd` by 1. Since `hd` was initially `hd - 1`, after executing the code, `hd` becomes `hd - 2`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, and `res` remain unchanged.
