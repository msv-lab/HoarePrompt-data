Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` remains within this range after executing the code. The other parts of the initial state (the test cases and box states) are not affected by this code snippet.
