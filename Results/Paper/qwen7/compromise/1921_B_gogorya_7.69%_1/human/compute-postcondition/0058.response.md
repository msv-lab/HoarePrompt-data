Output State: **`hd` is decreased by 3, `t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `hd -= 1` decreases the value of `hd` by 1. Since `hd` was initially decreased by 2, after this operation, `hd` is further decreased by 1, making it decreased by a total of 3. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
