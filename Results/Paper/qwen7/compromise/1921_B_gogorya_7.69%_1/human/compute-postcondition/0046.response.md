Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting value of the range function).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.

5. **List the necessary adjustments**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes.
   - `i` should be set to 0, as it is the starting point of the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
