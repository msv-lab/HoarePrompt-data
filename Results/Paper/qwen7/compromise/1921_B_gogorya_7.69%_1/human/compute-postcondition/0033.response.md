Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `hd` is decremented by 1, and `res` is incremented by 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `res` is incremented by 1.**

This means that `res` has been incremented by 1 regardless of the values of `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`. Additionally, `i` has been incremented by 1 and `hd` has been decremented by 1 as per the initial postconditions.
