Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is an input string, `a1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s1`, `a2` is the number of times '1' appears in `s2`.**

Explanation: The code `a2 = s2.count('1')` counts the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `s2` and assigns the result to the variable `a2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, and `a1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
