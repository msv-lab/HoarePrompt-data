Output State: **`hd` is decreased by 2, `t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `hd`, `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only effect is that the loop will proceed to the next iteration.
