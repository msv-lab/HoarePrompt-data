Output State: **`res` is an integer greater than 0 and has been incremented by 1, `s1[i]` is '1', `s2[i]` is '0', and `hd` is an integer greater than 0, and is either equal to `hd - 1` or remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `hd` is an integer greater than 0 and its value either remains unchanged or decreases by 1 (`hd - 1`), and there are no other changes to `s1[i]` or `s2[i]`, their values remain '1' and '0' respectively.
