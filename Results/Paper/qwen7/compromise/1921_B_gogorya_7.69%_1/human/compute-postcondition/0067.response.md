Output State: **`hd` is decreased by 2, `t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `res` is increased by 1 if `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0'**.

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values or perform any operations. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if in a loop) and moves to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `hd`, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `res` also remains the same.
