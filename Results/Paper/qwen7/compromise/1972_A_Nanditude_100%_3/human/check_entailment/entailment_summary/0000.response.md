Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the elements of the two arrays `a` and `b`. For each element in `b`, it checks if it is less than the corresponding element in `a`. If it is, it increments the counter `cnt`. This approach is logically sound because it correctly identifies the positions where the difficulty of the problems needs to be increased.

However, there is a critical issue with the loop variable `i`. The variable `i` is intended to track the position in array `a` but is not properly incremented when an element in `b` is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `a`. As a result, the program may incorrectly count the number of new problems needed.

To fix this, the variable `i` should be incremented whenever an element in `b` is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `a`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        i = 0
        for j in range(n):
            if b[j] < a[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(cnt)
```

Given the provided execution summary and the reasoning above, the original program is incorrect due to the improper handling of the index `i`. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
