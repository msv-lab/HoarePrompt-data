Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is either 0 or 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 1.
   - If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, then `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `i` remains 1, and `j` remains 1. Otherwise, `i` is set to 2, and `j` remains 1.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 2 (since it starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `i` remains 2 as per the conditions given.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**
