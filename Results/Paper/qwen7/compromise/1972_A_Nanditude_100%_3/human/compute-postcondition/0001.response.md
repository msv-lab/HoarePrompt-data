State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, the minimum value `t` can take is 1.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since the loop head only involves `t`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.
