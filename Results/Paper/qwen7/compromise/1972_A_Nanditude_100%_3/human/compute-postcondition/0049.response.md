Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 2, `j` is `j + 1`, `i` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `cnt` is increased by 1 and `j` is `j + 1`. The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `cnt` was already increased by 1, it is now increased by 2. The value of `j` remains as `j + 1` because the code does not affect `j`. The value of `i` is now increased by 1.
