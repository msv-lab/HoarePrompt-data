Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `j`, and it ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is `previous_j + 1`.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, then `cnt` is `previous_cnt + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `j` will be `previous_j + 2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains the same unless the loop exits due to `j >= n`, but since the postcondition does not indicate that `n` changes, `n` remains the same.
   - The value of `i` is only increased if `b[j] >= a[i]`, so `i` remains the same or increases by 1.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
   - `j` is `previous_j + 2`.
   - `i` remains the same or increases by 1, but we cannot determine its exact value without knowing the outcome of the loop body.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration can be described as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `previous_j + 2`, `i` is the same as the previous iteration or increased by 1**.
