Output State: **`cnt` is either 1 or 2, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` was either 0 or 1 initially, after executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` will now be either 1 or 2. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
