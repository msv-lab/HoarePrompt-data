Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `j`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value of `j` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is increased by 1, regardless of whether `b[j]` is less than `a[i]` or not.
   - If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is incremented once (which it already has).
   - If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `i` is increased by 1 and `j` is set to `j_prev + 1`, but `cnt` is still incremented by 1.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is the value of `j`. Since the loop runs for each `j` in the range from `0` to `n-1`, the value of `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`cnt` is increased by 1, `j` is `j + 1`**.

Since `i` and `j_prev` are not mentioned as being adjusted in the loop head, they remain unchanged. The only adjustment needed is for `j` to be incremented by 1.
