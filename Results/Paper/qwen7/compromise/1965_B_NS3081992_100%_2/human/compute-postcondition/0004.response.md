Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it prints a sequence of integers to the standard output. The number of integers printed is determined by the return value of `func_10()`, and each integer is generated by calling `func_14()`. The specific values printed depend on the implementations of `func_10()` and `func_14()`, but they form a sequence of integers.**
