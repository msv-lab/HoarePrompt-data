Output State: The output state consists of the numbers printed by `func_14()` for each iteration of the loop, with each number written on a new line. The total number of lines will be equal to the return value of `func_10()`. Each number printed is determined by the implementation of `func_14()`. Since the exact behavior of `func_10()` and `func_14()` is not specified, the specific numbers cannot be determined, but they will form a sequence of integers based on the function definitions.
