You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'
        #State: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is the second return value of `func_7()`, and `n` is not equal to 2
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`, `k` is 1, `l` is 4, `n` is not equal to 2.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop starts with `i` being 2 and runs until `i` is less than `l`. Given `l` is the length of `b`, and initially `ans` is `[2, 3]`, we can infer that `l` is initially 2 (since the length of `[2, 3]` is 2). However, the loop starts from `i = 2` and goes up to `l - 1`, so it will run once for `i = 2` and once for `i = 3`, appending `2 ** 2 = 4` and `2 ** 3 = 8` to `ans`. After the loop, `ans` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 8]`, `k` remains 1, `l` is now 4 (since we appended two more elements to `ans`), and `n` remains not equal to 2.
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: ans is [1, 2, 4].
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: ans is [1, 2, 4, 2, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2
    #State: `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2, starting from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{l-1}\), where \(l\) is the length of the binary representation `b` of `n`. `k` is either 1 or `k + 1`, and `n` is not equal to 2.
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns the length of the list `ans` as a string followed by a newline character, then the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a string representing the length of the list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'

Case_2: The program returns the length of the list `ans` as a string followed by a newline character, then the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
