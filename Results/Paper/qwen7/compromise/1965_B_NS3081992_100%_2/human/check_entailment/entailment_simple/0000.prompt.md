Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

        #Explanation: The loop starts with `i` being 2 and runs until `i` is less than `l`. Given `l` is the length of `b`, and initially `ans` is `[2, 3]`, we can infer that `l` is initially 2 (since the length of `[2, 3]` is 2). However, the loop starts from `i = 2` and goes up to `l - 1`, so it will run once for `i = 2` and once for `i = 3`, appending `2 ** 2 = 4` and `2 ** 3 = 8` to `ans`. After the loop, `ans` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 8]`, `k` remains 1, `l` is now 4 (since we appended two more elements to `ans`), and `n` remains not equal to 2.

        #State: ans is [1, 2, 4].
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: ans is [1, 2, 4, 2, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2
    #State: `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2, starting from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{l-1}\), where \(l\) is the length of the binary representation `b` of `n`. `k` is either 1 or `k + 1`, and `n` is not equal to 2.

    #The program returns the length of the list `ans` as a string followed by a newline character, then the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no integer `k` such that `1 <= k <= 10^6` and the sum of any subsequence of `a` equals `k`. For all integers `v` in the range `1 <= v <= n` where `v != k`, there exists a subsequence of `a` whose sum equals `v`. The length of the sequence `a` is at most 25.

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of the numbers printed by `func_14()` for each iteration of the loop, with each number written on a new line. The total number of lines will be equal to the return value of `func_10()`. Each number printed is determined by the implementation of `func_14()`. Since the exact behavior of `func_10()` and `func_14()` is not specified, the specific numbers cannot be determined, but they will form a sequence of integers based on the function definitions.
