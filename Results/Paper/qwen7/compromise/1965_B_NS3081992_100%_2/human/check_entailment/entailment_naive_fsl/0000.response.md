Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a sequence `a` that meets the specified conditions for all test cases. Specifically, the function `func_14()` does not ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum of `k`, which is a critical requirement. Here's an example where the program fails:

For the test case `n = 8` and `k = 8`, the program generates the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 16]`. This sequence does not meet the condition that there should be no subsequence with a sum of `8`. The subsequence `[8]` has a sum of `8`.

To meet the problem description, the program needs to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while still allowing all other sums from `1` to `n` to be achievable through subsequences. The current implementation does not guarantee this.
