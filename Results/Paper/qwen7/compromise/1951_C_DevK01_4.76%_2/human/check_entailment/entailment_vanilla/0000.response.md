Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` for each of the `n` days.

2. **Setting Up Variables:**
   - `m` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`, ensuring that the maximum number of tickets purchased per day does not exceed `m`.
   - `M` is sorted to facilitate the greedy approach of buying tickets at the lowest possible prices first.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days Needed:**
   - `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`, which represents the number of days required to buy `k` tickets if the maximum number of tickets (`m`) can be bought each day.

4. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can buy all `k` tickets without any price increase. The cost calculation is straightforward.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means we need to buy some tickets on the last day(s) at increased prices. The program handles this by:
     - Removing the highest price from the first `q` days (`w`).
     - Calculating the number of additional tickets (`mu`) that need to be bought on the last day(s).
     - Adjusting the cost calculation accordingly.

5. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost is calculated using the formula:
     - `cost = mu * w`
     - `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n * m == k` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `n * m != k` by adjusting the cost calculation properly.

2. **Greedy Approach:**
   - The program uses a greedy approach to minimize the cost by buying tickets at the lowest possible prices first. This approach is valid given the constraints and the nature of the problem.

3. **Mathematical Formulas:**
   - The mathematical formulas used in the cost calculation are correct and align with the problem statement.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly, including edge cases and the greedy approach to minimize cost.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
