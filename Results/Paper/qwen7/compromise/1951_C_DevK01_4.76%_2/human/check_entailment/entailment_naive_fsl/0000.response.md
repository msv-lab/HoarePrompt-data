Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be purchased `k` is greater than the product of `m` and the number of days `n`. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of purchasing tickets across multiple days in a way that minimizes the total cost.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3
5 2 10
1 2 3 4 5
```
- Expected output:
```
20
```
- Actual output:
```
10
```

In this case, the program incorrectly assumes that buying 5 tickets on the first day and 5 tickets on the second day would result in a total cost of 10 (2 * 5). However, the correct approach would be to buy 2 tickets on the first day, 2 tickets on the second day, 2 tickets on the third day, 2 tickets on the fourth day, and 2 tickets on the fifth day, resulting in a total cost of 20 (2 * 1 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 * 4 + 2 * 5).

The program fails to consider the optimal distribution of ticket purchases across multiple days to minimize the total cost, especially when `k` is large relative to `m` and `n`.
