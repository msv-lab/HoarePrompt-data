To determine if the provided solution is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness step-by-step.

### Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` along with the array `M` representing the ticket prices for each day.

2. **Setting Up Variables:**
   - It sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` because the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a single day is limited by `m`.
   - It sorts the array `M` to facilitate the calculation of the minimum cost.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days Needed:**
   - It calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This represents the number of days required to buy `k` tickets if the maximum number of tickets (`m`) can be bought each day.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means that buying `m` tickets each day for `q` days will cover the requirement.
   - Otherwise, it needs to adjust the cost calculation:
     - It pops the last element `w` from the sorted list `N` (which now has length `q`).
     - It calculates the remaining tickets to be bought after using the maximum allowed tickets each day (`mu = k - (n - 1) * m`).
     - It adjusts the cost by adding the cost of buying `mu` tickets at the last day's price `w`.

5. **Final Cost Calculation:**
   - It calculates the cost by summing up the costs of buying tickets each day and adjusting for the price increases.

### Verification

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`
   - Prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - After sorting: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
   - `q = 2` (since `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`)
   - `N = [2, 4]`
   - Cost: `2 * (2 + 4) + 2 * 2 * (1) = 10`

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 8`
   - Prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - After sorting: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
   - `q = 4` (since `math.ceil(8 / 2) = 4`)
   - `N = [2, 4, 6, 8]`
   - Cost: `2 * (2 + 4 + 6 + 8) + 2 * 2 * (6) = 64`

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 100`, `k = 1`
   - Prices: `[10000, 1, 100, 10, 1000]`
   - After sorting: `[1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000]`
   - `q = 1` (since `math.ceil(1 / 100) = 1`)
   - `N = [1]`
   - Cost: `1 * 1 = 1`

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - `n = 6`, `m = 3`, `k = 9`
   - Prices: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
   - After sorting: `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
   - `q = 3` (since `math.ceil(9 / 3) = 3`)
   - `N = [5, 5, 5]`
   - Cost: `3 * (5 + 5 + 5) + 3 * 3 * (3) = 72`
