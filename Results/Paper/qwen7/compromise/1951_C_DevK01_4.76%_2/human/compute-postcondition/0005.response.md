Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` along with a list `M` of `n` integers. It then calculates a cost based on these values and prints the result. The final state of the program after processing all test cases includes the output of the calculated costs for each test case.**
