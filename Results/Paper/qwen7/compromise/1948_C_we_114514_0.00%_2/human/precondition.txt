t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and two strings of length n containing only '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively. Additionally, n is even, and there are no arrows pointing outside the grid.
