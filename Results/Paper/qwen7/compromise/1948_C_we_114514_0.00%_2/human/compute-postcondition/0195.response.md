Postcondition: `j` is `n - 1` or `j + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `True` if `row1[j]` is `'>'`, otherwise `reachable_first_row` is `False`. `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `j` is between `0` and `n - 1` (inclusive) and `row2[j]` is `'>'`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` is `False`.
