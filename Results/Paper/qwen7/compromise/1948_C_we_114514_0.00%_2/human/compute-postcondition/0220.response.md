Output State: `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `True` if the last character of `row1` is `'>'`, otherwise it is `False`. `reachable_second_row` is `True` if either `row1[n-1]` is `'>'` or `row2[n-1]` is `'>'`, otherwise it remains `False`.

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `j` will be `n - 1` because the loop increments `j` until it reaches `n - 1`. The state of `reachable_first_row` depends on whether the last character of `row1` is `'>'`. Similarly, `reachable_second_row` is `True` if the last character of either `row1` or `row2` is `'>'`, otherwise it remains `False`.
