Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `reachable_second_row` remains true, `reachable_first_row` is False**.

Explanation: The variable `reachable_first_row` is explicitly set to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, `reachable_second_row`) retain their initial conditions as specified in the initial state.
