Output State: **The program returns a list named 'results' which contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in 'test_cases', depending on whether the conditions within the loop were met for each test case.**

This means that the `return results` statement returns the `results` list as it is, containing the outcomes ('YES' or 'NO') for each test case processed in the loop.
