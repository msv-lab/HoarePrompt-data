Postcondition: `j` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, and the condition `reachable_first_row` is either true or false. If `j` is `n - 1` and `row1[j]` is '>', then `j` remains `n - 1` and `reachable_second_row` remains `True`. If `j` is 0 and `reachable_first_row` is false, then `j` remains 0. If `j` is between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive) and `row1[j]` is '>', then `j` is incremented by 1 and `reachable_second_row` becomes `True`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
