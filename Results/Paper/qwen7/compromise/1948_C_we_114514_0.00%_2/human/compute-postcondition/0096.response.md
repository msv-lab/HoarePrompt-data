Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is 0, and the value of `row2[j]` is '>'**.

This means that the variable `reachable_second_row` has been set to `True`, while the other variables (`reachable_first_row`, `j`, and `row2[j]`) retain their original values from the initial state.
