Output State: **`j` is equal to `n-1`, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `row2[n-1]` is '>', `results` is ['NO'], and `t` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending 'NO', it becomes ['NO']. The values of `j`, `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, `row2[n-1]`, and `t` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code.
