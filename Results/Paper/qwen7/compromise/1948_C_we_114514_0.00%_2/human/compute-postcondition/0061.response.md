Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[0]` is '>', and the condition `j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>'` is checked. If the condition is true, no changes are made. If the condition is false, no changes are made either.
