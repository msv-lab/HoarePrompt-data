Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and a parameter test_cases, which is a list of lists. Each inner list contains three elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid, where each string consists of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>'. The function returns a list named 'results' which contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in 'test_cases', depending on whether the conditions within the loop were met for each test case.**
