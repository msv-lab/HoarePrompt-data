Output State: **`j` is `n - 1` or `j + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `j` is between `0` and `n - 1` (inclusive) and `row1[j]` is `'>'`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` is `False`.**

Explanation: The line `reachable_first_row = False` sets the variable `reachable_first_row` to `False`. The values of `j`, `n`, `reachable_second_row`, and the condition for `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged from the initial state.
