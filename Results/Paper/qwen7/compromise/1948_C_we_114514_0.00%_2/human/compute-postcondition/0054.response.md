Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list
   - `reachable_first_row` is false
   - `reachable_second_row` is true
   - The current value of `row2[0]` is '>'

4. **Loop body behavior**:
   - If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, no changes are made.
   - Otherwise, the conditions remain as initially stated.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1, the loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.
   - After the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it `j = 2`.
   - The conditions involving `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, and `row2[0]` remain unchanged unless the loop body makes specific modifications, but based on the given information, no such modifications are mentioned.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `reachable_first_row` remains false.
   - `reachable_second_row` remains true.
   - `row2[0]` remains '>'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `j` is 2, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[0]` is '>'**.
