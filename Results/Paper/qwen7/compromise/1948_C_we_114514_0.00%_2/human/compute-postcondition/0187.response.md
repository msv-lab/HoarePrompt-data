Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Understand the Conditions Inside the Loop**:
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`:
     - If `j` is `n - 1` and `row1[j]` is `'>'`, then `j` remains `n - 1` and `reachable_second_row` remains `True`.
     - If `j` is between `0` and `n - 1` (inclusive) and `row1[j]` is `'>'`, then `j` is incremented by `1` and `reachable_second_row` becomes `True`.
     - Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is an integer.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `reachable_first_row` is `True`.
   - `reachable_second_row` is `True`.

4. **Analyze the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `reachable_second_row` is `True`, we need to check the conditions inside the loop.
   - If `j` is `n - 1` and `row1[j]` is `'>'`, `j` remains `n - 1` and `reachable_second_row` remains `True`.
   - If `j` is between `0` and `n - 1` (inclusive) and `row1[j]` is `'>'`, `j` is incremented by `1` and `reachable_second_row` becomes `True`.
   - Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.

5. **Determine the New Values for `j` and `reachable_second_row`**:
   - Since `reachable_second_row` is `True`, we need to consider both cases where `j` might change.
   - If `j` is `n - 1` and `row1[j]` is `'>'`, `j` remains `n - 1` and `reachable_second_row` remains `True`.
   - If `j` is between `0` and `n - 1` (inclusive) and `row1[j]` is `'>'`, `j` is incremented by `1` and `reachable_second_row` becomes `True`.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The new value of `j` will either be `n - 1` or `j + 1` depending on the condition.
   - `reachable_second_row` will either remain `True` or become `False` based on the condition.

Given these considerations, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`j` is `n - 1` or `j + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `j` is between `0` and `n - 1` (inclusive) and `row1[j]` is `'>'`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` is `False`.**
