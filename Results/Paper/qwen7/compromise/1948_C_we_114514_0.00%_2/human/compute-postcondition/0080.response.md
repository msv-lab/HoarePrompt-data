Postcondition: `j` is equal to `n-1`, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, and `reachable_second_row` is either `True` or `False`. The variable `results` will contain either `['YES']` or `['NO']`, depending on whether `reachable_second_row` is `True` or `False` respectively. `row2[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1` will still be '>', and `t` remains unchanged.
