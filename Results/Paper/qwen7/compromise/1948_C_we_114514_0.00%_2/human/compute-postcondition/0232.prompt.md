You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; each test case in test_cases is a list containing three elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid, where each string consists of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>'
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True
        
        reachable_second_row = False
        
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`, depending on whether the conditions within the loop were met for each test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' which contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in 'test_cases', depending on whether the conditions within the loop were met for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter t, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and a parameter test_cases, which is a list of lists. Each inner list contains three elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid, where each string consists of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>'. The function returns a list named 'results' which contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in 'test_cases', depending on whether the conditions within the loop were met for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named 'results' which contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in 'test_cases', depending on whether the conditions within the loop were met for each test case.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
