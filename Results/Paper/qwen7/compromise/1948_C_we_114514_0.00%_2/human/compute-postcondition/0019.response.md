Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, and the condition `reachable_first_row` is true. If the value of `row1[0]` is '>', then `reachable_second_row` is True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` becomes false, and `reachable_second_row` is True if `row2[0] == '>'`, or remains false if `row2[0] != '>'`.
