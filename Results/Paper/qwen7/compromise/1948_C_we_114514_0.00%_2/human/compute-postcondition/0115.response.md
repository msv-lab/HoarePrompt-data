Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is either incremented by 1.
   - `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` remain true.
   - If `j` equals `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` remains true.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `j` will be incremented to `n` (since it was `n - 1` before).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be incremented to `n`.
   - `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` remain true.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` remain true.**
