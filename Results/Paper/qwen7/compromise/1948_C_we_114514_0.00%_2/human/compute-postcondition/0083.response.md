Output State: **`j` is `n-1`, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is either `True` or `False`, `row2[j]` is `'>', `results` is either `['YES']` or `['NO']`, `test_case` is the next element in `test_cases`, and `n` and `row1` are assigned from `test_case`.**

Explanation: The code unpacks the `test_case` tuple into two variables, `n` and a tuple `(row1, row2)`. The values of `j`, `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, `row2[j]`, `results`, `t`, and `test_case` remain unchanged from their initial states.
