Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `reachable_first_row` remains `True`, `results` is a list containing either `['YES']` or `['NO']`, `test_case` is updated to `(n, (row1, row2))**.

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `False`. The values of `reachable_first_row`, `results`, and `test_case` remain unchanged from their initial states.
