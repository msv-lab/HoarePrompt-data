Output State: **`j` is `n - 1` or `j + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`.**

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. The values of `j`, `n`, `reachable_first_row` remain unchanged from the initial state.
