Postcondition: `j` is 0 and `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list. The condition `reachable_first_row` determines the state of `reachable_second_row`: if `row1[0] == '>',` then both `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are true. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` is false and `reachable_second_row` is true if `row2[0] == '>'`, or remains false if `row2[0] != '>'`.
