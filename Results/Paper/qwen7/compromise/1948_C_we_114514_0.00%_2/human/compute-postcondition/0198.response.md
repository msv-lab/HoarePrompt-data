Output State: **`reachable_second_row` is `True`, `j` is `n - 1` or `j + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `True` if `row1[j]` is `'>'`, otherwise `reachable_first_row` is `False`.**

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` sets the variable `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, `reachable_first_row`, `row1`, or `row2`. Therefore, the conditions for `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain as described in the initial state, with `reachable_second_row` being explicitly set to `True`.
