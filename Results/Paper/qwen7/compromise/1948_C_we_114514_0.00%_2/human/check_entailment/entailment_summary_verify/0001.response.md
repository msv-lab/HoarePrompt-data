### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the backtracking and intermediate movements required to reach the target cell `(2, n)`. Let's re-evaluate the program with the function summary and the problem description to verify this conclusion.

#### Function Summary Recap
The function `func_1` processes each test case and checks whether the robot can reach the last column of the second row by moving right in the first and second rows. It uses two flags, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`, to track the robot's position and movement possibilities.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Initialization:**
   - `reachable_first_row` is initialized to `True`, indicating the robot starts in the first row.
   - `reachable_second_row` is initialized to `False`, indicating the robot cannot start in the second row.

2. **Movement Logic:**
   - The program iterates through each column `j` of the grid.
   - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
     - If the robot reaches the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - Otherwise, if the next column in the second row can be reached (`j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If the robot is in the second row and the arrow points right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
     - If the robot reaches the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not account for scenarios where the robot needs to backtrack to the first row and then move to the second row.
   - The logic only checks if the robot can move directly from the first row to the second row without considering intermediate steps.

#### Example Analysis

Let's re-examine the examples provided:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   ```
   4
   >><<
   >>><
   ```
   - The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and can move right to `(1, 2)`.
   - From `(1, 2)`, it can move right to `(1, 3)`.
   - From `(1, 3)`, it can move down to `(2, 3)`.
   - From `(2, 3)`, it can move right to `(2, 4)`.
   - Therefore, the robot can reach `(2, 4)`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   ```
   2
   ><
   ><
   ```
   - The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and can move right to `(1, 2)`.
   - From `(1, 2)`, it can move down to `(2, 2)`.
   - Therefore, the robot can reach `(2, 2)`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   ```
   4
   >>><
   >><<
   ```
   - The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and can move right to `(1, 2)`.
   - From `(1, 2)`, it can move right to `(1, 3)`.
   - From `(1, 3)`, it can move down to `(2, 3)`.
   - From `(2, 3)`, it can move left to `(2, 2)`.
   - From `(2, 2)`, it can move left to `(2, 1)`.
   - From `(2, 1)`, it can move up to `(1, 1)`.
   - From `(1, 1)`, it can move right to `(1, 2)`.
   - From `(1, 2)`, it can move right to `(1, 3)`.
   - From `(1, 3)`, it can move down to `(2, 3)`.
   - From `(2, 3)`, it can move left to `(2, 2)`.
   - From `(2, 2)`, it can move left to `(2, 1)`.
   - The robot cannot reach `(2, 4)`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   ```
   6
   >><<><
   ><>>><
   ```
   - The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and can move right to `(1, 2)`.
   - From `(1, 2)`, it can move right to `(1, 3)`.
   - From `(1, 3)`, it can move right to `(1, 4)`.
   - From `(1, 4)`, it can move right to `(1, 5)`.
   - From `(1, 5)`, it can move right to `(1, 6)`.
   - From `(1, 6)`, it can move down to `(2, 6)`.
   - Therefore, the robot can reach `(2, 6)`.

From the above analysis, we see that the program correctly identifies whether the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)` in all provided examples. The logic in the program is sufficient to handle the given constraints and examples.
