Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and checking if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). However, the logic within the `func_1` function has some flaws that may lead to incorrect results.

1. **Initialization**: The variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are initialized to `True` and `False`, respectively. This means that initially, we assume the robot can start from the first row and eventually reach the second row.

2. **Logic for First Row**: The loop iterates through each column `j` of the grid. If the robot is currently in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`), it checks the direction of the arrow. If the arrow points right (`>`), it checks if the robot can move to the last column of the first row. If it reaches the last column, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. If the arrow points left (`<`), it sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` and checks if the arrow in the corresponding column of the second row points right, setting `reachable_second_row` to `True` if so.

3. **Logic for Second Row**: If the robot reaches the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`), it continues to check if the arrow points right. If it reaches the last column, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

However, this logic does not correctly simulate the robot's movement because it does not properly account for the robot moving down to the second row when the arrow in the first row points left. Additionally, the logic for determining if the robot can reach the second row is flawed because it only checks if the robot can move to the last column, which is not sufficient to ensure the robot can reach the last column of the second row.

Given these issues, the provided program may not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
