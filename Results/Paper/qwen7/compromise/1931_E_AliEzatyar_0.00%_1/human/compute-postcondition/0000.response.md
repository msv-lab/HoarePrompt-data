Output State: **`counter` is 0**.

The initial state defines that `num` is a list of integers, where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, and the length of the list `n` satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\). Additionally, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), and for each test case, an integer `m` is given such that \(0 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).

The code snippet initializes the variable `counter` to 0. No other operations are performed on `counter` or any other variables. Therefore, the only change is that `counter` is set to 0. All other conditions and values of the list `num` remain unchanged.
