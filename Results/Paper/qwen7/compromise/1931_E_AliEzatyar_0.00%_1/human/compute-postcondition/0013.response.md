Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(num) - 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs in reverse from `len(num) - 2` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `counter` is 2 if the element at position `len(num) - 2` is '0'. Otherwise, `counter` is 0.
   - `num` has at least one element.
   - `i` is `len(num) - 2`.
   - `num[i]` is not '0'.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `len(num) - 3`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be greater than or equal to 0.
   - If `i` is `len(num) - 3`, then the loop will continue as long as `len(num) - 3` is still non-negative.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `len(num) - 3`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `len(num) - 3` must be greater than or equal to 0, implying `len(num)` must be at least 3.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` is updated to `len(num) - 3`.
- `len(num)` must be at least 3.

Since the postcondition about `counter` and `num[i]` being '0' is not directly affected by the loop head, we do not need to change those states.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`counter` is 2 if the element at position `len(num) - 2` is '0'. Otherwise, `counter` is 0, `num` has at least one element, `i` is `len(num) - 3`, and `len(num)` must be at least 3.**
