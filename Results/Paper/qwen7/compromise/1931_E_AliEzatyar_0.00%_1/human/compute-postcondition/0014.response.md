Output State: **`counter` is 3 if the element at position `len(num) - 2` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 3`, and `len(num)` must be at least 3.**

Explanation: The initial state sets `counter` to 2 if the element at position `len(num) - 2` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 0. After executing `counter += 1`, if `counter` was initially 2 (meaning the element at position `len(num) - 2` is '0'), it becomes 3. If `counter` was initially 0, it becomes 1. The values of `i` and `len(num)` remain unchanged.
