Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`. The key objects here are `i` and `num`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(num) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time. This means the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `num`.

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` starts at `len(num) - 1`.
   - The list `num` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the initial state**:
   - Since `i` starts at `len(num) - 1`, we need to ensure that `len(num)` is at least 1.
   - Therefore, `num` must have at least one element.

Given the initial state where `counter` is 0, we need to adjust the state of `num` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`counter` is 0, `num` must have at least one element, `i` is len(num) - 1**
