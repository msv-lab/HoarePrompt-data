You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sashah'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `num` and returns the count of consecutive '0's from the end of the list. If the list does not end with any '0', it returns 0. If the list ends with one or more '0's, it returns the total count of those '0's.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the rules and logic of the game described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `m`, and the list of integers.

2. **Digit Count Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list (`total_digits`).
   - It also counts the number of trailing zeros in each number using the `func_1` function and stores these counts in the `zeros` list.

3. **Sorting and Processing Zeros:**
   - The `zeros` list is sorted in descending order.
   - The program processes pairs of zeros, summing up the larger ones (since they are sorted in descending order).

4. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and the sum of processed zeros (`subtract_zero`) is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If true, it concludes that Sasha wins ('Sashah' is printed).
   - Otherwise, it concludes that Anna wins ('Anna' is printed).

### Detailed Review

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a number.
   - This is used to identify numbers that can potentially be reversed to reduce their length significantly.

2. **Total Digits Calculation:**
   - The total number of digits in the list is calculated accurately by summing the lengths of all numbers.

3. **Zeros Count Handling:**
   - The zeros count is sorted in descending order, and pairs are processed.
   - This approach aims to minimize the total number of digits effectively.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is a simplified version of checking if the remaining number after optimal moves is large enough for Sasha to win.
   - However, the logic here might not fully capture the complexity of the game, especially considering the strategic nature of Sasha and Anna's moves.

### Potential Issues

- **Game Strategy Simplification:**
  - The program assumes that the optimal strategy involves only counting zeros and comparing the total digit count. This simplification might miss more complex strategies where players could strategically choose numbers to manipulate the game state.
  - The program does not simulate the actual game moves (reversing digits for Anna and concatenating for Sasha) but rather makes a decision based on the initial setup.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program might not handle edge cases well, such as lists with very few numbers or specific configurations of numbers that could lead to different outcomes.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not fully implement the game logic as described. It simplifies the problem to a point where it may not accurately determine the winner in all scenarios. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the full problem specification.
