Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by using a different approach than what is required. The logic in `func_1` does not correctly ensure that any two numbers in the same group do not share the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits. 

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Bitwise Operation**: The code uses `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` to transform the number, which doesn't guarantee that no two numbers will have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits. This operation essentially flips all bits of the number, but it doesn't ensure the required condition.

2. **Counting Approach**: The idea of counting and removing duplicates is flawed because it doesn't properly group numbers based on their bit patterns in the 31 least significant bits.

To correctly solve this problem, you should use a more appropriate data structure to track the bit patterns. A better approach would be to use a set to store the bit patterns of the numbers and increment the group count whenever a new unique pattern is encountered.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    bit_patterns = set()
    for num in a:
        # Create a bitmask with the 31 least significant bits
        bitmask = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)
        # If this bitmask has not been seen before, add it to the set
        if bitmask not in bit_patterns:
            bit_patterns.add(bitmask)
        else:
            # If it has been seen, it means we need another group
            pass
    return len(bit_patterns)

# The rest of the program remains the same
```

This approach ensures that each unique combination of the 31 least significant bits is counted only once, thus determining the minimum number of groups needed.
