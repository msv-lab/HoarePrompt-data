### Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires moving chips to the left until all chips are in a contiguous block with no free cells between them. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.
2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string representation of the cells (`arr`).
   - It then finds the first occurrence of '1' (a chip) using `x = arr.find('1')` and the last occurrence of '1' using `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`.
   - It extracts the substring `z = arr[x:n - y]` which should contain all the chips.
   - Finally, it counts the number of zeros ('0') in `z` and prints the count.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The logic for counting the number of operations is incorrect. The number of operations needed to move all chips to a contiguous block is not simply the count of free cells between the first and last chip.
   - The code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips to a contiguous block.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the positions of all chips and then determine the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together.
   - This can be done by finding the leftmost and rightmost positions of the chips and calculating the distance each chip needs to move to reach the leftmost position.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
