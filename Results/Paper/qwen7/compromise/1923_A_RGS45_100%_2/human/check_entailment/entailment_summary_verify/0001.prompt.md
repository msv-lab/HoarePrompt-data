You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t and a list of n binary digits (0s and 1s). For each test case, it finds the substring between the first and last occurrence of '1', inclusive, and counts the number of '0's in this substring. It then prints the count for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires moving chips to the left until all chips are in a contiguous block with no free cells between them. The goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.
2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the string representation of the cells (`arr`).
   - It then finds the first occurrence of '1' (a chip) using `x = arr.find('1')` and the last occurrence of '1' using `y = arr[::-1].find('1')`.
   - It extracts the substring `z = arr[x:n - y]` which should contain all the chips.
   - Finally, it counts the number of zeros ('0') in `z` and prints the count.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The logic for counting the number of operations is incorrect. The number of operations needed to move all chips to a contiguous block is not simply the count of free cells between the first and last chip.
   - The code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips to a contiguous block.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the positions of all chips and then determine the minimum number of moves required to bring all chips together.
   - This can be done by finding the leftmost and rightmost positions of the chips and calculating the distance each chip needs to move to reach the leftmost position.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
