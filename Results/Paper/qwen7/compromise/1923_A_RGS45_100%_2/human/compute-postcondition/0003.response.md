Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a list of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), where each integer is either 0 or 1, and at least one integer in the list is 1. The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

In natural language: The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `t` (which ranges from 1 to 1000) and a list of `n` integers (where `n` ranges from 2 to 50). Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, and at least one of these integers is 1. The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for each test case.
