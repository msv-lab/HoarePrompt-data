Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t and a list of n binary digits (0s and 1s). For each test case, it finds the substring between the first and last occurrence of '1', inclusive, and counts the number of '0's in this substring. It then prints the count for each test case.**
