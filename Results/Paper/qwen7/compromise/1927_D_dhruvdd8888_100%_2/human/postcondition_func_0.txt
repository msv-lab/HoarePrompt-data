The function processes a list of integers `nums` and handles a series of queries. It first identifies segments of consecutive identical elements in `nums` and stores their start and end indices along with the value of the elements. Then, for each query defined by `l` and `r`, it determines whether a valid segment exists within the specified range and prints the start and end indices of that segment, or `-1 -1` if no valid segment is found.
