Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())` with an additional element `-1` appended to it; `s` is an integer representing the start index of segments where elements in `nums` are the same; `e` is an integer representing the end index of segments where elements in `nums` are the same; `num` is the current integer being processed in `nums`; `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: the start index (`1 + s`), the end index (`i`), and the value of `num` for each segment of consecutive identical elements in `nums`.
