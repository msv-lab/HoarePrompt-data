Output State: **`LA` is equal to the length of `arr` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code `LA = len(arr) - 1` calculates the length of the list `arr` and subtracts 1 from it, storing the result in the variable `LA`. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `LA` now holds the value of the length of `arr` minus 1.
