### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the requirements of the problem. The problem requires us to count the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. This means we need to ensure that for any three sticks \(a_i\), \(a_j\), and \(a_k\) (where \(a_i \leq a_j \leq a_k\)), the condition \(a_i + a_j > a_k\) must hold.

The provided function `func()` does not explicitly check this triangle inequality condition. Instead, it simply counts all possible combinations of three sticks and prints the result. Let's break down the function step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each unique stick length using the list `q`.
3. **Identifying Unique Stick Lengths**: It identifies the unique stick lengths stored in the list `eta`.
4. **Calculating Combinations**: It calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from the same length and from different lengths without checking the triangle inequality condition.

Given the function summary, the function seems to be counting all possible combinations of three sticks, which is not correct according to the problem statement. We need to verify if the function actually checks the triangle inequality condition.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem description:

- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Input: 
    ```
    4
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    ```
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    35
    ```
  - Explanation: Any combination of three sticks can form a triangle since all sticks have the same length.

- **Test Case 2**: 
  - Input: 
    ```
    4
    4
    3 2 1 3
    ```
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    2
    ```
  - Explanation: The valid combinations are (3, 2, 1) and (3, 3, 1).

- **Test Case 3**: 
  - Input: 
    ```
    3
    3
    1 2 3
    ```
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    0
    ```
  - Explanation: No combination of three sticks can form a triangle.

- **Test Case 4**: 
  - Input: 
    ```
    1
    1
    1
    ```
  - Expected Output: 
    ```
    0
    ```
  - Explanation: There are no three sticks to form a triangle.

From these examples, it is clear that the function does not check the triangle inequality condition. Therefore, the function will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. It simply counts all possible combinations of three sticks without verifying the triangle inequality condition.

**Final: False**
