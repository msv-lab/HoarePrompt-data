Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the sum of all terms calculated in the loop, which can be expressed as \(\sum_{j=1}^{n} q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho\). If `n` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged.**
