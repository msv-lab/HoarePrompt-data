Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `eta_ln`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `eta_ln` must be at least 2.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `res` is increased by a specific formula involving `q[eta[1]]`, `q[eta[2]]`, and `rho`.
   - `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - `eta_ln` must remain the same because it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `res` and `rho` are not directly modified by the loop itself but are updated based on the values inside the loop. However, since we are only adjusting the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to change `res` or `rho` here.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `eta_ln` remains the same and must still be at least 2.
   - `j` is now 3.
   - `res` and `rho` are not adjusted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`eta_ln` must be at least 2, `j` is 3**
