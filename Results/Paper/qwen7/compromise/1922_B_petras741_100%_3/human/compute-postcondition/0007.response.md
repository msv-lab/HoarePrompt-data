Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, and `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `q` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The value of `t`, `buffer`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state.
