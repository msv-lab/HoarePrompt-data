Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.
   - This means that during the previous iteration, `j` was some value (let's call it `j_prev`), and `q[w[j_prev]]` was incremented.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_prev + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `j_prev + 1` must be less than `n`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - The variable `j` will be updated to `j_prev + 1`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j_prev + 1`**.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `j_prev`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`**.

So, the final state is:

State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`**.
