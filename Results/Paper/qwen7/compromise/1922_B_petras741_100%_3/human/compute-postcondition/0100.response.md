Output State: **`eta_ln` must be at least 2, `j` is 2, `res` is increased by `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`**

Explanation:
- Initially, `res` is increased by `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6`.
- In the new line of code, `res` is further increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.
- Since `j` is 1 initially and then incremented to 2, `eta[j]` now refers to `eta[2]`.
- Therefore, `res` is updated to include both the initial increment and the new increment based on `eta[2]`.

The output state includes the updated value of `res` which is the sum of the two increments.
