Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is -1, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `eta` is a list containing the values `n - 1` and `n - 2` (if `n` is greater than 1).**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will decrement from `n` to 0 and then to -1. The loop checks if `q[j] > 0`, but since `q` is initialized with all zeros, this condition never evaluates to true. Therefore, `eta` will contain the values of `j` as it decreases from `n` to 0, which are `n-1`, `n-2`, ..., 0. Once `j` reaches -1, the loop terminates.
