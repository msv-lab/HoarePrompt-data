Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `q[j]` is greater than 0.
   - `eta` contains the index `j + 1` and now also contains `j`.
   - `q` is a list of integers.
   - `j + 1` is an index within the range of the list `q`.

4. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, if the loop is about to execute again, `j` will be incremented by 1.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be `j + 1` (the next value).
   - `eta` will contain `j + 1` and `j` (as it did before, but now with the updated `j`).

Given these points, let's adjust the state:

- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `eta` will still contain `j + 1` and `j`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`q[j + 1]` is greater than 0; `eta` contains the index `j + 2` and also contains `j + 1`; `q` is a list of integers, and `j + 2` is an index within the range of the list `q`**.
