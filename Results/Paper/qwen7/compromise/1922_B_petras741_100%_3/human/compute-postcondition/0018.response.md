Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate from `j = 0` to `j = n`. Therefore, `j` will take values from `0` to `n` inclusive.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer. Since `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is a valid non-negative integer.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is a valid non-negative integer. Given that `n` is an input integer, we assume it is valid unless specified otherwise.
   - The value of `j` at the start of the loop is `n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` (must be a non-negative integer) and `j` (initially set to `n`).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, buffer is a list containing integers from the input, i is 0, n must be a non-negative integer, j is n, q is a list of length n + 1 where each element is 0, eta is an empty list**
