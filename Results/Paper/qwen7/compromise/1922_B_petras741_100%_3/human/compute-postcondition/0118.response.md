Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `buffer`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
