Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `n - 1`, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `eta` is a list containing the value `n - 1`. If `q[j] > 0`, no changes are made to the variables.**
