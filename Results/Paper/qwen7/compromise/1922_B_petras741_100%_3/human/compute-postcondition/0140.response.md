Output State: **`q[j + 1]` is greater than 0; `eta` contains the index `j + 2`, the index `j + 1`, and the index `j`; `q` is a list of integers, and `j + 2` is an index within the range of the list `q`**.

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Initially, `eta` contained the index `j + 2` and the index `j + 1`. After appending `j`, `eta` now contains `j + 2`, `j + 1`, and `j`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
