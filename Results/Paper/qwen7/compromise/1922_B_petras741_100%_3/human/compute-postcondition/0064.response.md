Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `q` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is 0, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the sum of all terms calculated in the loop, which can be expressed as \(\sum_{j=1}^{n} q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho. If `n` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the list `q` has been initialized to a list of zeros of length `n+1`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
