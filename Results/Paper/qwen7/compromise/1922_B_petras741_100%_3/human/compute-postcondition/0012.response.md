Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < n`.

3. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.
   - This means that at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was some value, say `j_prev`, and `n` must be greater than `j_prev`.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j_prev + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `j_prev + 1` must be less than `n`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The variable `j` will be `j_prev + 1`.
   - The variable `n` must remain the same and must still satisfy the condition `j_prev + 1 < n`.

Given that the exact value of `j_prev` is not specified, we can generalize it as follows:

- Let `j_prev` be the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.
- The new value of `j` will be `j_prev + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j_prev + 1`**.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j_prev`, we can represent it symbolically:

**State: `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`**.
