Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The states of the other variables are not affected.**

This means that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, and is constrained to be between 1 and 10^4. The other variables (`n` and the list `a`) remain in their initial state as described in the precondition.
