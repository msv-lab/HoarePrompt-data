Output State: **`n` is the final number of iterations, `j` must be between 0 and n inclusive, and the current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0; `eta` now contains the value of `j`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. The values of `n`, `j`, and `q[j]` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
