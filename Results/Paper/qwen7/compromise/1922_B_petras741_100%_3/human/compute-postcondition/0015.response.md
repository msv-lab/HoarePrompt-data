Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `j` is equal to `n`, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, and every `q[w[j]]` for `j` in the range of `n` has been incremented by 1.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `j` in each iteration and continues as long as `j` is less than `n`. Each element in the list `q` at index `w[j]` where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1` will have been incremented exactly once.
