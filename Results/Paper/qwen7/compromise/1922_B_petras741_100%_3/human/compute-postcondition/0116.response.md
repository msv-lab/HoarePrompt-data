Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, and if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated based on the sum of specific calculations involving elements from the `eta` list and the value of `rho`. If `n` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged.**
