The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the user. It then checks if \( k \) is even and if \( n \) is odd or even, setting a maximum value for \( k \) based on \( n \). If \( k \) exceeds this maximum value, it returns (0, 0). Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \). The function can return either (0, 0) or (n, k), where \( n \) is an integer and \( k \) is an even integer.
