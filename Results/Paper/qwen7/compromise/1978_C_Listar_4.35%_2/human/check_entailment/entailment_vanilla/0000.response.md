### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function checks if \( k \) is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \).
   - If \( k \) is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because an even number cannot be achieved.
   - If \( n \) is odd, the maximum Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\).
   - If \( n \) is even, the maximum Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2}{2}\).
   - If \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns `(0, 0)`.

3. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function constructs a permutation based on the given \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It iteratively moves elements to the front or back of the list to adjust the Manhattan value until it reaches \( k \).

4. **Analyzing `func_3`:**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation and ends with a newline.

5. **Analyzing `func_4`:**
   - This function calls `func_2` to check if a valid permutation exists.
   - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to construct the permutation and then `func_3` to print the result.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code correctly handles edge cases where \( k \) is odd or when \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - The construction logic in `func_1` ensures that the Manhattan value matches \( k \) by moving elements appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. It checks for the feasibility of constructing a permutation with the required Manhattan value and constructs one if possible. The functions handle all specified conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
