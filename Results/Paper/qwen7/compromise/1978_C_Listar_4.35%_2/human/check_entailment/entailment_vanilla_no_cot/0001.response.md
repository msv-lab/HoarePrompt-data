### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that the Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function checks if \( k \) is even and if the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( k \).
   - If \( k \) is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution.
   - For even \( k \), it calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value:
     - If \( n \) is odd, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - If \( n \) is even, the maximum value is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - It returns `(n, k)` if \( k \) is within the possible range.

3. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function constructs the permutation based on the value of \( k \).
   - It starts with a list of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It iteratively moves the last element to the front until \( k \) becomes zero or the condition fails.
   - The logic ensures that the Manhattan value matches \( k \).

4. **Analyzing `func_3` and `func_4`:**
   - `func_3` prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - `func_4` combines the functionality of `func_2` and `func_1` to solve the problem:
     - It first checks if a solution exists using `func_2`.
     - If a solution exists, it constructs the permutation using `func_1` and prints it using `func_3`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The functions handle edge cases where \( k \) is odd or the maximum possible Manhattan value is less than \( k \).
   - They correctly identify when no permutation can satisfy the given conditions.

6. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The functions correctly implement the logic to find a permutation with the specified Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists.
   - The code handles all given constraints and examples provided.
