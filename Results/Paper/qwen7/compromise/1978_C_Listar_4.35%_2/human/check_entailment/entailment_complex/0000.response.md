### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( k \) is even and if \( n \) is odd or even.
   - It sets a maximum value for \( k \) based on \( n \): 
     - If \( n \) is odd, \( \text{max\_k} = \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).
     - If \( n \) is even, \( \text{max\_k} = \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - If \( k \) exceeds \( \text{max\_k} \), it returns (0, 0).
   - Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes \( n \) and \( k \) as inputs.
   - It initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It performs a series of rotations on the list `l` to achieve a specific Manhattan value.
   - The key logic involves rotating the list to the left by \( k \) positions, ensuring that the resulting permutation has the desired Manhattan value.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function takes a list `l` as input.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
   - It then prints a newline and returns nothing.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the flow of the program.
   - It first calls `func_2` to get \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is 0, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with \( n \) and \( k \) to get the permutation list `l`.
   - Finally, it calls `func_3` with the list `l`.

### Analysis:

- **Function `func_2`**: Ensures that \( k \) is even and within the valid range based on \( n \).
- **Function `func_1`**: Generates a permutation with the required Manhattan value.
- **Function `func_3`**: Prints the permutation correctly.
- **Function `func_4`**: Properly handles the flow and ensures the correct output format.
