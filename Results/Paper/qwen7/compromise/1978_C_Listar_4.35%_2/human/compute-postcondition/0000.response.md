Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_2()` calls the function `func_2()`, which returns two values, `n` and `k`. These values are assigned to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The initial conditions for `n` and `k` are preserved, meaning `n` remains within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5 and `k` remains within the range 0 to 10^12. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
