Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `k` is 0
   - `ans` is `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0])`
   - `n` must be greater than 1

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, making `i` equal to 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 3 because `i` needs to be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3.

6. **Keep other states unchanged**: 
   - `k` remains 0.
   - `ans` remains `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0])`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 0, `ans` is `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0])`, `n` must be greater than 3**
