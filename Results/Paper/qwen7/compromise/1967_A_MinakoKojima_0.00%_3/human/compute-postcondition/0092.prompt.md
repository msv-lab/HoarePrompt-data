Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = min(a)
    ans = 0
    if k >= n * m:
        ans = math.factorial(n)
    else:
        k -= n * m
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is either n!, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`; otherwise, `ans` is the cumulative product of differences between consecutive elements of the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input followed by a space and then the second integer `k`, `a` is a list containing two integers where the first one is `n` and the second one is `k`, `m` is the minimum of `n` and `k`, and both `k` and `m` retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `ans` is the factorial of `n` if `k >= n * m`, otherwise `ans` is the product of differences between consecutive elements from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `m` is the minimum value of the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `ans` is the factorial of the first integer input, `i` is `n`, `m` is the minimum value of the list `a`, `next_input` is the integer input for the next iteration. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `i` is `n`, `k` remains 0, and `ans` holds the product of the expression `(a[i] - a[i-1])` starting from `i=1` up to `i=n-1`, multiplied by the initial value `a[0]`. Otherwise, `m` is the minimum value of the list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
