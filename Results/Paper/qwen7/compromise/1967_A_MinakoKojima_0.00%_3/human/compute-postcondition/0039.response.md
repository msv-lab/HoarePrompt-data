Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`, `m` is the minimum value of the list `a`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the factorial of `n` and assigns it to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
