Postcondition: `ans` is either n!, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`; otherwise, `ans` is the cumulative product of differences between consecutive elements of the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input followed by a space and then the second integer `k`, `a` is a list containing two integers where the first one is `n` and the second one is `k`, `m` is the minimum of `n` and `k`, and both `k` and `m` retain their initial values.
