Output State: `i` is `-1`, `k` is `0`.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the variable `i` is decremented by 1, starting from `n-1`. The loop continues until `i` becomes -1, which means it has completed `n` iterations. Since `k` is reduced by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` in each iteration, and assuming `k` is non-negative and large enough initially to allow all reductions, after `n` iterations, `k` will be reduced to 0. At this point, `i` will be `-1`, indicating the loop has finished all its iterations.
