Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. This means the variable `i` is being iterated over from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 1`
   - `k` is `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`. Since `i` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `0` (because `range(n)` generates values from `0` to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be set to `0` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged because the loop hasn't executed yet, and the expression `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` will be evaluated when `i` is `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `0`, `k` is `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`**
