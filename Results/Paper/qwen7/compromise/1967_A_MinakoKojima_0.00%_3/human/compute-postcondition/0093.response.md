Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For each test case, it accepts two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12. Additionally, it accepts a list a of n integers, each between 1 and 10^12 inclusive. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not detailed in the given information.**
