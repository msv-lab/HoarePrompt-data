Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input followed by a space and then the second integer `k`, `a` is a list containing two integers, the first one is `n` and the second one is `k`, `m` is the minimum of `n` and `k`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `m`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
