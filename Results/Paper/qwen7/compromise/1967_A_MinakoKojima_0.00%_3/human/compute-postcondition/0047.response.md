Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `k` is updated based on the expression `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be at least 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the states**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - The value of `k` is updated based on the expression, but since we are only asked to update the states for the loop to execute, we do not need to explicitly state the new value of `k` unless it is directly relevant to the loop condition.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` must be 2 (to satisfy the loop condition `i < n`).
   - `n` must still be at least 1.
   - `k` is not directly relevant to the loop condition, so its state does not need to be explicitly stated.

Therefore, the final state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1**
