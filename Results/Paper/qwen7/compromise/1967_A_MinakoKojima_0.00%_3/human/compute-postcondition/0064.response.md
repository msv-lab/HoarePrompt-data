Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `ans` is the factorial of `n` if `k \geq n \cdot m`, otherwise `ans` is the product of differences between consecutive elements from `a[1]` to `a[n-2]`, `i` is `n - 1`, `m` is the minimum value of the list `a`, and `next_input` is the integer input for the next iteration, `n` and `k` are updated to the values of the first two integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
