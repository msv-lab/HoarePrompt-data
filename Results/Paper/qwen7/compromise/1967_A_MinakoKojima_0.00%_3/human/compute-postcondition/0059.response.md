Output State: `i` is `n - 1`; `ans` is multiplied by the difference between each consecutive pair of elements from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]`.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached `n - 1`, having incremented from `1` up to `n - 1`. The variable `ans` will be the product of differences between each consecutive pair of elements in the list `a`, starting from `a[1] - a[0]` and continuing through to `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`. This means `ans` accumulates the product of these differences as the loop iterates over the specified range.
