Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` until it reaches `n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `ans` is multiplied by `a[3] - a[2]`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time).
   - Therefore, `i` should be 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Consider the effect of the loop body**:
   - The loop body multiplies `ans` by `a[3] - a[2]`, but this does not affect the loop condition or the values of `i` and `n`.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `ans` is multiplied by `a[3] - a[2]`, and `n` must be greater than 1**
