Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 0, `ans` is `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[3] - a[2])`, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`. So, `ans` is updated to `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[3] - a[2])`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 3 still holds.
