Postcondition: `bullets_used` remains 0, `can_survive` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
