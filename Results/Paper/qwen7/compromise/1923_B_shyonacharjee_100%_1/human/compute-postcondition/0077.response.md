Output State: **`bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is True, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`.**

The code assigns the value of `abs(pos)` to the variable `distance`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `pos`, `distance` is calculated as the absolute value of `pos`, but no other variables are affected.
