Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health` more than its previous value, `monsters` is a list of tuples, `pos` is the first element of the first tuple in the list, `health` is the second element of the first tuple in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, and if `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.**

In this output state, the variable `bullets_used` is incremented by the value of `health`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, and the conditions related to `can_survive` and the loop or if statement remain as they were.
