Postcondition: `bullets_used`, `health`, `pos`, `distance`, and `total_bullets_needed` retain their original values. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
