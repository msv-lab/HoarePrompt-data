Output State: **`bullets_used` is `health`, `can_survive` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples that must contain at least two tuples, `x` is a list of integers obtained from input, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `health`; `distance` is calculated as the absolute value of `pos`.**

In this output state, the `distance` variable is updated to be the absolute value of `pos`, while all other variables retain their initial values.
