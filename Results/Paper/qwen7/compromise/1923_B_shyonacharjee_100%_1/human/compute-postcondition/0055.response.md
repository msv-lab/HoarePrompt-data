Postcondition: `bullets_used` is the `health` value from the second tuple in the list, `pos` is the first element of the second tuple in the list, `health` is the second element of the second tuple in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of the new `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is the sum of `bullets_used` and `health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then `can_survive` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, there is no change to the variables.
