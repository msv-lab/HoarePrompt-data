Output State: **`bullets_used` is increased by `health`, `health` is the health of the next monster, `pos` is the position of the next monster, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `can_survive` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, the values of `bullets_used`, `health`, `pos`, `total_bullets_needed`, `distance`, and `can_survive` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the program exits the current loop or conditional block.
