Postcondition: `monsters` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `can_survive` is `False`. If `total_bullets_needed` is not greater than `distance * k`, the else part does not provide additional information as it is not specified.
