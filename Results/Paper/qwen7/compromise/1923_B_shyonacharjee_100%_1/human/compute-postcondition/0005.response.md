Output State: **`monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3 ⋅ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `zip(x, a)` object into a list called `monsters` based on the absolute value of the first element of each tuple (i.e., the elements of `x`). The sorting does not affect the values of `x`, `a`, `n`, `k`, or `t`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3 ⋅ 10^4 remains unchanged.
