Output State: **`monsters` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple; `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`; `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`.**

The code assigns the value of `bullets_used + health` to the variable `total_bullets_needed`. No other changes are made to the variables `monsters` or `distance`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
