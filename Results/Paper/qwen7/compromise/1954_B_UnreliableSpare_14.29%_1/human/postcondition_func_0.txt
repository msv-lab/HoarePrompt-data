The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( n \)). The function determines whether the array \( a \) is uniform (all elements are the same) or not. If the array is uniform, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of the longest sequence of identical elements in the array and prints this value.
