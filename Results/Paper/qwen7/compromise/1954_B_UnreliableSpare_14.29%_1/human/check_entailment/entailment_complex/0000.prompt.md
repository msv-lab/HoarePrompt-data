Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

# Annotated Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5; the array a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the array is beautiful; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `flag` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop checks if the current element in the list `arr` is different from the previous one. If it finds any difference, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. Therefore, `flag` will be `False` if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` that are different. If all elements are the same, `flag` remains `True`.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: `flag` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value between the initial value and the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of val in arr)
    #State: `flag` is either True or False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `val` is the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `ans` and `cnt`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( n \)). The function determines whether the array \( a \) is uniform (all elements are the same) or not. If the array is uniform, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum length of the longest sequence of identical elements in the array and prints this value.
