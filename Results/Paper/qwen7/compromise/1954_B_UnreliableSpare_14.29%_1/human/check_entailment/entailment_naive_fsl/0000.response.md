Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to correctly identify and count the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

According to the problem description, the correct output should be `1`, because removing the element at index 2 (value 1) makes the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]` which is no longer beautiful.

However, the current implementation of the program does not handle this case correctly. It checks if the array is already beautiful by comparing adjacent elements and sets a flag. In this case, the flag is set to `False` because there are adjacent elements that are not equal. Then, it tries to find the minimum number of elements to remove by counting consecutive occurrences of the same value. This approach is flawed because it does not account for the requirement to remove elements to break the beauty condition.

To fix this, the program needs to identify the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same and then calculate the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty condition. The current implementation does not achieve this.
