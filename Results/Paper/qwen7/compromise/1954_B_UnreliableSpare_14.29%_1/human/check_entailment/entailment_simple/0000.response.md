### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - **Check for Non-Beauty**: It first checks if the array is already non-beautiful by comparing consecutive elements. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks the loop. Otherwise, `flag` remains `True`.
   - **Finding Minimum Removals**: If the array is beautiful (`flag` is `True`), it calculates the minimum number of removals needed. This is done by counting the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of the first element and using this count to determine the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty condition.
   - **Output**: If the array is beautiful, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the calculated minimum number of removals.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code correctly handles the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem statement.
   - The logic for checking if the array is beautiful and calculating the minimum removals is sound.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The function correctly identifies whether the array is already non-beautiful.
   - For beautiful arrays, it correctly calculates the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.
   - The use of `Decimal` for `ans` is unnecessary and can be replaced with `int` since the values involved are within the integer range.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
