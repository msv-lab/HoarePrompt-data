Output State: **`flag` is True, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `flag`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating `flag` to `True`.
