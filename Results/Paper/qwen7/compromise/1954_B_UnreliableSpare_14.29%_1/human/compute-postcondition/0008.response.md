Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the loop head, but it will start from 0 (the default value for `range(n)`).
   - `n` is given as an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `0 < n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop executes.

5. **Other variables**:
   - `flag`, `t`, `arr`, `val`, and `cnt` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. They can remain in their current states.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
