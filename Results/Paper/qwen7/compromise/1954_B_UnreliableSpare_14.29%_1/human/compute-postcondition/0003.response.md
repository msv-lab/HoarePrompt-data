Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (since the loop starts with `range(1, n)`).
   - `n` is an input integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means that `i` should be set to 1 and `n` should be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `flag` is initially `True`, but it does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, but it does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `arr` is a list of integers, but it does not affect the loop execution directly.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
