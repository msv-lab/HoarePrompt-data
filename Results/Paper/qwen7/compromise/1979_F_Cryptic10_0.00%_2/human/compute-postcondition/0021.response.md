Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding `v`, `d` is n-2, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `u` is assigned by `func_1(d)`, `path` now contains `v`, and `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` has been executed.**

This means that the set `remaining_vertices` has had the element `v` removed, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
