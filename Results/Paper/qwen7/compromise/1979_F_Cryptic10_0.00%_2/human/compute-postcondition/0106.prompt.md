You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
def func_2(n):
    path = []
    remaining_vertices = set(range(1, n + 1))
    while remaining_vertices:
        for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            v, u = func_1(d)
            if v == 0:
                continue
            if v in remaining_vertices:
                path.append(v)
                remaining_vertices.remove(v)
                break
        
    #State: Output State: `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, `d` is -1, `n` is less than or equal to 0, and `path` contains a sequence of vertices from the loop, ending with the last `u` value encountered before the loop terminates.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `remaining_vertices` will be empty because all possible vertices have been processed and added to `path`. The variable `d` will be -1 because the loop decrements `d` from `n-1` to 0 and then continues until `d` reaches -1. The variable `n` will still be less than or equal to 0 as per the given conditions, even though it might have been greater initially. The `path` will contain all the vertices that satisfied the condition `v in remaining_vertices` during the loop's execution, forming a sequence of vertices that were added to `path` before the loop terminated.
    print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")
    #This is printed: !
    sys.stdout.flush()
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and returns either "even" if `n` is even, or "odd" if `n` is odd.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
