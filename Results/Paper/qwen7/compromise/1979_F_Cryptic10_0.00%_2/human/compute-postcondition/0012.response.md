Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding `v`, `d` is n-1, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list with the last element being `v`.**

Explanation: The code removes the value `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. This means that `v` is no longer part of the set. All other variables (`d`, `v`, and `path`) remain unchanged, with `d` still being `n-1`, `v` being a value that was originally in `remaining_vertices`, and `path` having its last element as `v`.
