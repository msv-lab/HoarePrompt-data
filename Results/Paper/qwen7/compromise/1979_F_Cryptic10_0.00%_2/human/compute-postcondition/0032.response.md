Postcondition: `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding v, except v has been removed; `d` is n-3; `u` is equal to `func_1(n-3)`, `v` is a value returned by `func_1(d)`, and `path` contains v and u. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
