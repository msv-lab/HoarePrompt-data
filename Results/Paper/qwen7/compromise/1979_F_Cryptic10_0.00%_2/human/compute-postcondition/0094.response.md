Postcondition: **`remaining_vertices` does not contain `v` anymore, `d` is -1, `v` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(-1)`, `u` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(-1)`, `n` is still greater than 0, and `path` now includes the value of `v`. The loop either continues or breaks depending on whether `v` is 0. If `v` is not 0, the loop continues.**
