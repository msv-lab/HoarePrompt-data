Output State: `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, `d` is -1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `path` is a list containing all vertices from 1 to n in the order they were added during the loop iterations. The loop will continue to decrement `d` from `n-1` down to 0, calling `func_1(d)` to get `v` and `u`. For each `d`, if `v` is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`, it will be added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`, then the loop breaks for that `d`. If `v` is 0 or not in `remaining_vertices`, the loop continues until `d` reaches -1, at which point the loop terminates. Since the loop processes all possible values of `d` and removes all vertices from `remaining_vertices`, the set will be empty by the end of the loop.
