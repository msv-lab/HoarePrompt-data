Output State: **`d` is `n - 2`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 2)`, and `path` either includes the value of `v` minus one occurrence or remains unchanged, and we continue the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables or affect the path condition. Therefore, the values of `d`, `v`, `u`, and the condition for `path` remain unchanged. We also continue the most internal loop or if statement.
