Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `d` which is being iterated over using the `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` function. This means `d` takes values from `n-1` down to `0`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`.
   - `d` is `n-2`.
   - `u` is assigned by `func_1(d)`.
   - `path` now contains `v`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `d`**:
   - Since the loop is iterating in reverse (from `n-1` to `0`), the next value of `d` would be `n-3`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `d` will be updated to `n-3`.
   - `u` will be reassigned by calling `func_1(n-3)`.
   - `path` will still contain `v` unless the loop body modifies it, but since no such modification is mentioned, it remains unchanged.
   - `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the loop.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`.
   - `d` is `n-3`.
   - `u` is assigned by `func_1(n-3)`.
   - `path` contains `v`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding v, `d` is n-3, `u` is assigned by func_1(n-3), `path` contains v**
