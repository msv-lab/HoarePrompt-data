Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, `d` is n-1, `v` is a value in `remaining_vertices`, `path` is a list with the last element being `v`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is a value returned by `func_1(d)` and is currently in `remaining_vertices`, it remains in `remaining_vertices`. The value of `d` and `n` do not change. Therefore, the updated state includes `path` having `v` as its last element.
