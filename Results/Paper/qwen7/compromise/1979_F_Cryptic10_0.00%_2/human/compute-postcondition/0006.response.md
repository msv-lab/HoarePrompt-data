Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `d` is n-1, `v` and `u` are values returned by `func_1(d)`, `v` is 0, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement does not modify any variables but instead moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the values of `remaining_vertices`, `n`, `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop.
