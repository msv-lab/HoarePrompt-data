Output State: **`d` is `n - 3`, `v` is the first return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, `path` now includes the value of `v` appended.**

Explanation: The code `v, u = func_1(d)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `d`, which is `n - 3`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `v` and `u` respectively. The value of `d` remains `n - 3`, and the value of `v` is updated to the first return value of `func_1(n - 3)`, while `u` is updated to the second return value of `func_1(n - 3)`. The `path` now includes the value of `v` appended to it.
