Based on the initial state provided:

- `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.
- `d` is -1.
- `n` is less than or equal to 0.
- `path` contains a sequence of vertices from the loop, ending with the last `u` value encountered before the loop terminates.

Given that `remaining_vertices` is empty, the loop that populates `path` will not execute any iterations since there are no vertices left in `remaining_vertices`. Therefore, `path` will remain empty.

The `print` statement will then print the string "! " followed by the elements of `path` joined into a single string with spaces between them. Since `path` is empty, the result will be "! " followed by an empty string.

Output: **!**
