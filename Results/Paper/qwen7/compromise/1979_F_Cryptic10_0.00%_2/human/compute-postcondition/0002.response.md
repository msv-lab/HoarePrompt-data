Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `remaining_vertices`. This means the loop will continue as long as `remaining_vertices` is non-empty.

2. **Current state**: 
   - `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `path` is an empty list.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: For the loop to execute at least once, `remaining_vertices` must be non-empty. Since `remaining_vertices` is defined as a set containing integers from 1 to n, it is guaranteed to be non-empty as long as \(n > 0\).

4. **Check the constraints**: Given that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), it is certain that `remaining_vertices` will contain at least one element (the integer 1, for example).

5. **Conclusion**: Since `remaining_vertices` is guaranteed to be non-empty given the constraints, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop executes at least once.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `path` is an empty list**
