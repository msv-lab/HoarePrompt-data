Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is 0, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and `path` now includes the value of `v`.**

Explanation: The line `path.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is currently 0, `path` now contains the value 0. All other variables (`d`, `v`, and `u`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
