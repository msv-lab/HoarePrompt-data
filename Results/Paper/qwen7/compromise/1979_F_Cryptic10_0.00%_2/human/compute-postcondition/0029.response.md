Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding v, `d` is n-3, `u` is equal to `func_1(n-3)`, `v` is a value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` contains v and u, and `path` has appended v.**

Explanation: The code `path.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. The value of `v` is determined by the function call `func_1(d)`, where `d` is `n-3`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
