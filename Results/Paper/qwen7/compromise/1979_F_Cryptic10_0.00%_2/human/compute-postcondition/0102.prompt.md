Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `path` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while remaining_vertices:
    for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        v, u = func_1(d)
        if v == 0:
            continue
        if v in remaining_vertices:
            path.append(v)
            remaining_vertices.remove(v)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding all vertices that were added to `path`. `d` is -1. `u` is equal to `func_1(-1)`, which is undefined since the loop condition `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` ensures `d` will never reach -1 within the loop. `v` is the last vertex added to `path` before breaking out of the loop, and `path` contains all vertices added during the loop iterations.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The loop has executed for all iterations (from `d=n-1` down to `d=0`). The final state of `remaining_vertices` is a set of integers from 1 to n that were never added to `path`. The variable `d` is now `-1`. The variable `path` contains a sequence of vertices added during each iteration where the condition `v in remaining_vertices` was met.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `remaining_vertices` is empty, `d` is -1, `n` is less than or equal to 0, and `path` contains a sequence of vertices from the loop, ending with the last `u` value encountered before the loop terminates. The loop will continue decrementing `d` until it reaches -1, and for each iteration, it will call `func_1(d)` to get `v` and `u`. If `v` is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`, it will be added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`, then the loop breaks. If `v` is 0 or not in `remaining_vertices`, the loop continues until `d` reaches -1. Once `d` is -1, the loop terminates.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
