Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding v, except v has been removed; `d` is n-3; `u` is equal to `func_1(n-3)`, `v` is a value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` contains v and u.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `v` from the set `remaining_vertices`. Since `remaining_vertices` initially contained integers from 1 to n excluding `v`, after removing `v`, `remaining_vertices` will no longer contain `v`. All other variables (`d`, `u`, `v`, and `path`) remain unchanged.
