Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function prints a query `? d` and reads the response.
   - It returns a tuple `(v, u)` where `v` is the vertex with the minimum degree at least `d`, and `u` is the vertex that is not connected to `v`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Initializes an empty list `path` to store the Hamiltonian path.
   - Uses a set `remaining_vertices` to keep track of the vertices that need to be included in the path.
   - Loops until all vertices are included in the path:
     - For each degree `d` from `n-1` down to `0`:
       - Calls `func_1(d)` to get the vertex `v` and its non-connected neighbor `u`.
       - If `v` is `0`, it means no vertex with the current degree exists, so it continues to the next degree.
       - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the path and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
       - Breaks the loop since we found a valid vertex `v` and its non-connected neighbor `u`.

3. **Output the Hamiltonian Path**:
   - Converts the path list to a string and prints it as `! path`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Query Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the queries by calling `func_1(d)` for decreasing values of `d` until it finds a valid vertex `v` with at least `d` connections.
   - It ensures that the vertex `v` is removed from the graph after being added to the path.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program iteratively builds the Hamiltonian path by ensuring that each vertex is added only once and that the path remains valid.
   - Since the graph is complete and exactly `n-2` edges are removed, a Hamiltonian path always exists.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where no vertex with the current degree exists (`v == 0`).
   - It ensures that the path includes all vertices exactly once.

### Conclusion

The given program appears to follow the correct logic to find a Hamiltonian path using the specified queries. It correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the path is built iteratively by removing vertices and their edges.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
