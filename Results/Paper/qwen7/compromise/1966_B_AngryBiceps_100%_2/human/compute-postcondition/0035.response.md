Output State: **`a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user, `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `first_row`. Since `a` contains only one element (which is the input provided by the user), `a[-1]` refers to this single element, and `[0]` accesses its first character. The other variables remain unchanged.
