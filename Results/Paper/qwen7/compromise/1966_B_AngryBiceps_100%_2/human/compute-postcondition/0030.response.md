Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the original list `a`, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in the original list `a`, repeated according to their position in the list, `i` is `n`, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations, `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user, and `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = []` initializes an empty list `a`. This operation does not affect the values of `first_row`, `last_row`, `i`, `n`, and `m`, which remain unchanged from their initial states.
