Output State: **`a` is a list with three elements, where the first element is the initial input provided by the user, the second element is the new input provided by the user, and the third element is the current input provided by the user; `first_row` is the concatenation of `first_row` and the first character of the last element of `a`; `i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 1; `last_row` is the last character of the new input provided by the user plus twice the last character of the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element of `a` to `last_row` twice. Since `a[-1][-1]` is the last character of the last element of `a`, and the code adds it to `last_row` twice, `last_row` now contains the last character of the new input provided by the user plus twice the last character of the last element of `a`.
