You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and a grid of size n × m where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n × m over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
            ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: All test cases have been processed, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `a` is a list containing `n` elements for each test case, where `n` is the number of rows in the grid for that test case. Each element in `a` is a string representing a row of the grid. `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each row in `a`. `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each row in `a`. The variable `i` is `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations for all test cases. For each test case, if the conditions specified in the loop body are met (either the first and last rows are uniform but different, or neither the first nor the last row is uniform), the output is 'NO'. Otherwise, the output is 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. Each cell in the grid contains either 'W' or 'B'. The function also accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it returns a result based on the grid configuration.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
