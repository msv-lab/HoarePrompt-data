Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. This means the loop will execute based on the integer value provided by the user.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the input provided by the user at each iteration.
   - `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in `a`, concatenated together.
   - `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in `a`, concatenated together.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user.
   - `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as the user provides an integer input. The number of iterations is determined by this input.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The variable `i` will be updated to `n - 1` again because the loop starts with `i` set to `n - 1`.
   - The variable `n` will be updated to the new value of the integer input provided by the user.
   - The variable `m` will remain unchanged as it is not part of the loop condition.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `a` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `first_row` and `last_row` remain the same as they are not affected by the loop.
   - `i` will be `n - 1`.
   - `n` will be the new value of the integer input provided by the user.
   - `m` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the input provided by the user at each iteration; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in `a`, concatenated together; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in `a`, concatenated together; `i` is `n - 1`; `n` is the new integer value of the input provided by the user; `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**
