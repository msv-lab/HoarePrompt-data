Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is an input provided by the user.
- `first_row` is a string made up of the first character from each input string in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string made up of the last character from each input string in `a`.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user.
- `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.
- The set of the first character of the first element in `a` contains only one unique character.
- The set of the last character of the last element in `a` contains only one unique character.
- The first character of the first element in `a` is different from the last character of the last element in `a`.

Given this information, the `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string "NO".

Output: **NO**
