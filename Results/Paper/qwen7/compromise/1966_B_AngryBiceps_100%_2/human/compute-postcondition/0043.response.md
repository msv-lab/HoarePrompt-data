Output State: **`a` is a list containing three elements, the first element is the initial input provided by the user, the second element is the previous input provided by the user, and the third element is the current input provided by the user; `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the last element in `a` and the first character of the last element in `a` plus the first character of the last element in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` plus the last character of the last element in `a`; `i` is `n + 1`; `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in `a` to `first_row`. Since `a[-1][0]` refers to the first character of the last element in `a`, `first_row` now includes this character twice (once from the previous value and once from the current addition). All other variables remain unchanged.
