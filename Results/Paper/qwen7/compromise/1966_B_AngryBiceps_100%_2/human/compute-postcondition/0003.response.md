Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the first split value, `m` is an integer input from the second split value; `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string.**

The code initializes `first_row` as an empty string, but does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of these variables while adding the new variable `first_row` with its initialized value.
