Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user plus one, `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**

The code assigns an empty string to `last_row`. Since `last_row` was initially an empty string, assigning an empty string to it does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
