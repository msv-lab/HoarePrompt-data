Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers up to 500, and each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it checks if the first and last rows of the grid are uniform (all characters the same) but different from each other, or if the first and last characters of each row are uniform but different from each other. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.**
