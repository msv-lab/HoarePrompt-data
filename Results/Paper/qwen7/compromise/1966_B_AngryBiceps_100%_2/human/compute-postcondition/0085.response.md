Postcondition: **`a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being an input provided by the user; `first_row` is a concatenation of the first characters of all these inputs; `last_row` is a concatenation of the last characters of all these inputs; `i` is `-1`; if the set of the first character of the first element in `a` contains exactly one unique character, the set of the last character of the last element in `a` contains exactly one unique character, and the first character of the first element in `a` is not equal to the last character of the last element in `a`, then `first_row` and `last_row` are not equal. Otherwise, the set of the first character of the first element in `a` is not a single character, the set of the last character of the last element in `a` is not a single character, or the first character of the first element in `a` is equal to the last character of the last element in `a`, and `first_row` and `last_row` either both consist of exactly one unique character and are not equal to each other, or one of them is a single character or the same as the other.**
