Output State: **`a` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the input provided by the user initially, the second element is the current input provided by the user; `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the last element in `a` and the first character of the last element in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a`; `i` is `n`; `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user; `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the existing value of `first_row`. Since `a[-1][0]` refers to the first character of the last element in `a`, `first_row` is updated to include this character. The other variables remain unchanged.
