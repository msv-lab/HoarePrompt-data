Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly determine whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the allowed operations. The logic in the solution is flawed because it only checks the first and last row and column for uniformity and equality, which is insufficient to determine the overall possibility of making the entire grid uniform.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if the grid can be reduced to a single color through the given operations. Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach:

1. **Check Rows:** If any row has mixed colors, it means we cannot make all squares in the grid the same color.
2. **Check Columns:** Similarly, if any column has mixed colors, it means we cannot make all squares in the grid the same color.

If all rows and columns are uniform (i.e., they are either all 'W' or all 'B'), then it is possible to make the entire grid uniform. Otherwise, it is not possible.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        all_rows_uniform = all(row == a[0] for row in a)
        
        # Check if all columns are the same
        all_columns_uniform = all(all(a[i][j] == a[0][0] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m))
        
        if all_rows_uniform or all_columns_uniform:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This solution correctly checks if all rows or all columns are uniform, which is sufficient to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.
