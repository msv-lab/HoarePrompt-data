Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` must be between 3 and \( n-3 \), `ans` is now the opposite of its original value.**

Explanation: The code `ans ^= 1` flips the value of `ans`. If `ans` was originally 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged as the code does not affect these variables.
