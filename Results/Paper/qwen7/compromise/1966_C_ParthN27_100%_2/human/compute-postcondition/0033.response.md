Postcondition: **`total` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, and `ans` is 0 if `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is not greater than 1, otherwise `ans` remains as it was (either 1 or 0).**
