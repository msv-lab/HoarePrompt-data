Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `arr[i+1]` is added to the set `s`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 1`
   - `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration (`i = i + 1`), in the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `i + 1` (which will now be `i + 2`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr[i+1]` is added to the set `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`, and `arr[i]` is added to the set `s`**
