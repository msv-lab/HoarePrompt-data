Output State: **`ans` is now the opposite of its original value, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` must be between 1 and n-1, and the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is XORed with 1, which flips its value. The other conditions and constraints on the variables `n`, `i`, and the relationship between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
