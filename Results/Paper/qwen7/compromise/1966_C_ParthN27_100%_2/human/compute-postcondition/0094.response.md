Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n-2`, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` reflects the final toggle state based on the sequence in `s`, `total` is 1, and `n` is the length of list `s` with `n` not equal to 2. The loop has completed its iterations, and whether `ans` is 1 or 0 depends on whether the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` was ever met during the loop. If the condition was met, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` reflects the final toggle state without being toggled due to the condition being met.
