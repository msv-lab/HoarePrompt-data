Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` must be between 2 and \( n-1 \), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `n` or `i`. It simply breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional was specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that we acknowledge breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
