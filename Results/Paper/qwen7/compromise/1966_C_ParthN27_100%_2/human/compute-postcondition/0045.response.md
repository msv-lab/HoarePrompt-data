Postcondition: ***`total` is 1, `i` is less than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, and `ans` is 0.***

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the if condition is met or not, the final state of the variables remains the same as the precondition. Specifically, `total` is 1, `i` is less than 0, `n` is at least 3, `s` is a sorted list starting with 0 and followed by elements from `arr`, and `ans` is 0.
