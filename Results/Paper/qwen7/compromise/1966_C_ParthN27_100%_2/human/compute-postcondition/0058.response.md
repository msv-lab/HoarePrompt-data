Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is `n-2`, `s` is a set containing `arr[n-2]`, `arr[i]`, and `arr[n-1]`, `ans` is 0, `total` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the value of `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since `i` was initially `n-1`, after decrementing `i` by 1, `i` becomes `n-2`. The set `s` now contains `arr[n-2]`, `arr[i]` (which is now `arr[n-2]`), and `arr[n-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
