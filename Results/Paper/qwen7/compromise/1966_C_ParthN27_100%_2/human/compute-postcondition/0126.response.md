Output State: **`ans` is now the opposite of its original value, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` must be between 2 and \( n-1 \)**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is XORed with 1 (`ans ^= 1`). This operation toggles the value of `ans`. If `ans` was originally 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the operation.
