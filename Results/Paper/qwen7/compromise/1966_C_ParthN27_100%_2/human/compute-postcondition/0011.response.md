Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and `s` contains all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `n` should still satisfy the condition of being greater than 0, the index `i` will have reached `n-1`, and the set `s` will contain every element from the list `arr` that was added during the loop iterations.
