Output State: **`n` is equal to the length of list `s`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `s` is a list containing [0] followed by all the elements from the list `arr[0]` to `arr[n-1]` sorted in ascending order, `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` updates the value of `n` to be the length of the list `s`. The other variables (`i`, `s`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
