Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is 1 (or any value between 1 and n-2), `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 0, `total` is 1, `n` is the length of list `s`, and `n` is not equal to 2, `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ans` and 1. Initially, `ans` is 1. The XOR operation between 1 and 1 results in 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
