Output State: **`arr[i]` is added to the set `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the element `arr[i]` to the set `s`. Since sets do not allow duplicate elements, if `arr[i]` was already present in `s`, it remains unchanged. The state of `arr` and other variables not involved in this operation remains unaffected. Therefore, the only change is that `arr[i]` is now part of the set `s`.
