Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 0, `total` is 1, `n` is the length of list `s`, and `n` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The line `ans ^= 1` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ans` and 1. Since `ans` was initially either 1 or 0, performing `ans ^= 1` will toggle its value. If `ans` was 1, it becomes 0; if `ans` was 0, it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
