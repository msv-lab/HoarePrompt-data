Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input, `i` is either -1 or `n-2`, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `ans` reflects the final toggle state based on the sequence in `s`, `total` is 1, and `n` is the length of list `s`. If the length of list `s` is 2, `i` is -1 and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `i` is `n-2`, and `ans` is 1 if the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` is ever met during the loop; otherwise, `ans` is toggled between 0 and 1 with each iteration.
