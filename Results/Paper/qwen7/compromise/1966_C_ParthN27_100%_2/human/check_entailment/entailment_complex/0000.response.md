Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a specified number of stones from all non-empty piles until no more moves can be made. The key insight is that the game state can be simplified by considering the unique values in the sorted list of stone counts.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles (`n`) and the initial number of stones in each pile (`arr`).
   - It creates a set of unique stone counts and sorts them.
   - The function then checks if the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted unique list is more than 1.
   - If the number of such differences is even, it prints 'Alice'; otherwise, it prints 'Bob'.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of checking the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted unique list is correct. This approach leverages the fact that the game state can be reduced to the unique values and their differences.
   - The use of XOR (`ans ^= 1`) to toggle the result based on the parity of the number of differences is correct.
   - The function handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

Based on the above analysis, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
