Output State: **The program returns a value which is `n` minus 1, but the value of `n` is not specified in the initial state.**

Given the initial state does not specify the value of `n`, the return statement simply subtracts 1 from `n`. Since `n` is not defined, the exact numerical result cannot be determined, but the operation to be performed is clear.
