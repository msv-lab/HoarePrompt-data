Output State: **`ind` is an empty list, `a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `x` is the k-th element of list `a`.**

The code initializes an empty list `ind`. The values of `a`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
