Postcondition: `ind` is a list containing indices of at least one element from the list `a` where the elements are greater than the 14th element of `a`; `c` is either 2 or less than 2 depending on whether the condition `c == 2` was met during the loop; `x` remains as the 14th element of list `a`; `a` remains unchanged; `len(ind)` is not equal to 1
