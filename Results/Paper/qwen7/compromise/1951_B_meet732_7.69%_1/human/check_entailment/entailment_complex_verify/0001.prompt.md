You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of distinct integers and an integer `k`. It identifies indices of elements in `a` that are greater than the `k`-th element of `a`. Based on the number of such indices found and their positions relative to `k`, the function returns one of several possible values. Specifically, it can return `n-1`, `k-1`, `ind[0]-1`, the maximum of `k-ind[0]` and `ind[0]-1`, the minimum of `ind[1]-1` and `k-1`, the maximum of `ind[0]-1` and `ind[1]-ind[0]`, or the maximum of `ind[0]-1` and `k-ind[0]`. The returned value depends on the conditions met during the execution of the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the number of matches that cow `k` can win by either swapping its position with another cow or doing nothing. The matches follow a specific pattern where each cow plays against the next cow in line, and the cow with the higher rating wins.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of the cow `k`.
   - It then reads the ratings of the cows into a list `l`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list of ratings `a`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of ratings `a` and calculates the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.
   - It first retrieves the rating of cow `k` and stores it in `x`.
   - It then initializes an empty list `ind` to store indices of cows with ratings greater than `x` and a counter `c` to count such cows.
   - It iterates through the list of ratings and adds indices of cows with higher ratings to `ind` until it finds two such cows or exhausts the list.
   - If `k` is at index 14, it prints the indices of the cows with higher ratings for debugging purposes.
   - Depending on the length of `ind`, the function returns different values:
     - If no cows have higher ratings (`ind == []`), it returns `n - 1` because cow `k` can potentially win all matches.
     - If there is exactly one cow with a higher rating, it calculates the maximum number of wins based on the positions.
     - If there are two cows with higher ratings, it calculates the maximum number of wins considering both scenarios (swapping or not).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for determining the maximum number of wins seems to handle the basic cases correctly.
   - However, there are some issues:
     - The function does not handle the case where `k` is the highest-rated cow.
     - The function does not consider the possibility of swapping `k` with another cow to maximize wins.
     - The function does not account for the fact that swapping could potentially allow `k` to win more matches by changing its initial position.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation does not fully address the problem requirements. It lacks the logic to optimally swap positions to maximize wins.

Correctness: **False**
