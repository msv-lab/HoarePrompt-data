### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided function `func_1` step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function takes a list `a` and an integer `k`.
   - `x` is set to the `k`-th element of `a`.
   - `ind` is initialized as an empty list to store indices of elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.
   - `c` is initialized to count how many elements in `a` are greater than `x`.

2. **Loop to Find Indices**:
   - The loop iterates through the list `a` and checks if any element is greater than `x`.
   - If an element is greater than `x`, its index is added to `ind`, and `c` is incremented.
   - The loop breaks if two such elements are found (`c == 2`).

3. **Conditional Logic**:
   - **Case 1**: If `ind` is empty, the function returns `n - 1`, meaning the cow can potentially win all remaining matches.
   - **Case 2**: If `ind` contains exactly one index:
     - If the index is `0`, the function returns `k - 1`, meaning the cow can win up to `k - 1` matches.
     - If the index is greater than `k`, the function returns the index minus 1, indicating the cow can win until the match with the higher-rated cow.
     - Otherwise, the function returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, indicating the best possible number of wins considering the position of the higher-rated cow.
   - **Case 3**: If `ind` contains more than one index:
     - If the first index in `ind` is `0`, the function returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
     - If `k` is greater than the second index in `ind`, the function returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
     - Otherwise, the function returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

Given the detailed analysis, the function appears to handle all cases correctly based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of wins for the cow based on the given conditions.

**Correctness: **True**
