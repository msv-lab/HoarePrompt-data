### Reasoning

The original assessment is incorrect because the provided program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the specified operations. Let's break down the issues and provide a detailed explanation:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the frequency of each card number but does not use this information to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left.
   - The logic in the main part of the program is flawed because it only checks if `k` is present in the frequency values and prints `k - 1` or `n` based on this condition, which is not sufficient.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The condition `if k in freq.values()` is not a valid way to determine the minimum number of cards. Even if `k` is present in the frequency values, it does not guarantee that you can reduce the number of cards to `k - 1`.
   - The program should consider the distribution of card counts and the ability to exchange groups of `k` cards more carefully.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to group the card numbers by their counts and determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further.
   - For each group of card numbers, calculate how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed (`v // k`).
   - Multiply by `(k - 1)` to get the number of cards after exchanging.
   - Add the remaining cards that cannot form a full group (`v % k`).

The provided corrected program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each card number and then calculates the minimum number of cards based on the distribution of these frequencies.

### Corrected Program

```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card number
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards
    min_cards = sum(v // k for v in freq.values()) * (k - 1) + sum(v % k for v in freq.values())
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Count the Frequency**:
   - Use `Counter` to count the frequency of each card number.

2. **Calculate Minimum Cards**:
   - For each group of card numbers, calculate how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed (`v // k`).
   - Multiply by `(k - 1)` to get the number of cards after exchanging.
   - Add the remaining cards that cannot form a full group (`v % k`).

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect. The corrected program provided above should be used instead.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
