Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, and k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100; `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `frequency_table`. This dictionary will be used to store the frequency of each number in the list `arr`. However, since no elements from `arr` are added to `frequency_table` in this snippet, it remains empty. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
