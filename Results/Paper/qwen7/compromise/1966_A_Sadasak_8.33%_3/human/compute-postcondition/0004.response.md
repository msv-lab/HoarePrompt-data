Output State: **The program returns a dictionary where each key is a number from the list `arr` and its value is the maximum occurrence of that number up to `k`. If any number's occurrence exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`.**

This means that the function returns the `frequency_table` dictionary as defined in the initial state, with each key being a number from the list `arr` and its corresponding value being the maximum occurrence of that number, but capped at `k` if the actual occurrence exceeds `k`.
