Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to be removed `k`.
   - It then reads the edges and constructs a tree.
   - The tree is represented using a class `Tree`, which likely contains methods to add edges and root the tree.

2. **Functions**:
   - **func_1**: This function seems to traverse the tree and calculate some properties related to the components and sizes after removing edges. However, the implementation details are not provided, and the function names suggest it might not be fully implemented or correct.
   - **func_2**: This function appears to recursively calculate the number of good components and the remaining size after removing edges. It uses a divide-and-conquer approach.
   - **func_3**: This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that the number of good components is greater than `k` and the remaining size of each component is at least `x`.
   - **func_4**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x` that satisfies the conditions. It calls `func_3` to check the feasibility of a given `x`.
   - **func_5**: This function handles the main logic of reading input, constructing the tree, and calling `func_4` to get the result.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are incomplete and their implementations are not provided. They are crucial for calculating the required properties of the tree.
   - Without these functions, the program cannot correctly determine the maximum `x`.

2. **Algorithmic Approach**:
   - The algorithm used in `func_4` is a binary search to find the maximum `x`. This approach is generally correct, but it relies on the correctness of `func_3` and the other functions.
   - If `func_3` is not correctly implemented, the binary search might fail to converge to the correct answer.

3. **Tree Rooting**:
   - The method `root_tree_non_recursive` is called to root the tree, but its implementation is not provided. If this method does not correctly root the tree, the subsequent operations might fail.

### Conclusion

Given the incomplete and unprovided implementations of `func_1` and `func_2`, and the reliance on these functions for the core logic, the program is not fully functional and cannot be determined to be correct based on the provided information.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
