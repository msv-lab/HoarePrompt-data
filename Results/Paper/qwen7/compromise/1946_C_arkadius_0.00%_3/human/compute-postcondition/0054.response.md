Output State: **`stack` will contain tuples of all the vertices in the subtree rooted at `v`, with their second element set to `False`, (postorder) is true, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `good_components` attribute of `tree.vertices[v]` by adding the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
