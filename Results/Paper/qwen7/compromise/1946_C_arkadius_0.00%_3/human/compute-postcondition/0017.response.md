Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while beg < end`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop condition are `beg` and `end`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**:
   - If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`, then `beg` is updated to `mid`, and `mid` is recalculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`.
   - Otherwise, `mid` is updated to `(beg + end - 1) // 2`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `beg < end` must still hold true.
   - We need to ensure that `beg` and `end` are such that `beg < end` remains valid.

4. **Analyze the States**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `beg` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `beg` must be less than `end`.
   - The value of `mid` is updated based on the result of `func_3`, but the loop condition itself depends on `beg` and `end`.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - To ensure `beg < end` holds true for the next iteration, we need to maintain the condition that `beg` is less than `end`.
   - Since the loop updates either `beg` or `end` (or both), we need to ensure that the updated values still satisfy `beg < end`.

Given the loop condition `beg < end`, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `beg` and `end`. However, since the loop can certainly execute one more time based on the given conditions, no specific adjustments are needed beyond ensuring the loop condition remains valid.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`beg` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `beg` must be less than `end`**
