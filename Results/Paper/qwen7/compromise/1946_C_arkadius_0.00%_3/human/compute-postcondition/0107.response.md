Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all child vertices `u` of `v`. Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all child vertices `u` of `v` that have `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` less than `x`.**
