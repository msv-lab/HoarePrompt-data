Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an integer obtained from input, an edge is added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree, `[u, v]` is a list containing integers obtained from input.**

The code `tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)` adds an edge between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the tree. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, `v`, and the list `[u, v]` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 2 remains valid.
