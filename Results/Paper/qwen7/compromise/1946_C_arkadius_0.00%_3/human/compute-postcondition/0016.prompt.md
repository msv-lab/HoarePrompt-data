You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and tree is an object representing the tree structure where methods like add_edge and root_tree_non_recursive are available.
def func_5():
    [n, k] = map(int, input().split())
    tree = Tree(n)
    for i in range(1, n):
        [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
        
        tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all `k` edges have been added to the tree. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, and the tree will have `k` edges added between pairs of nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`, where `u` and `v` are integers obtained from input.
    tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
    print(func_4(tree, n, k))
    #This is printed: func_4(tree, n, k) (where func_4 returns a value related to the tree with n nodes and k edges)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but uses the variables `n`, `k`, and `tree`. It removes `k` edges from the tree structure represented by the `tree` object, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree. The function does not return any value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
