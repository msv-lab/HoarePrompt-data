Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all `k` edges have been added to the tree. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, and the tree will have `k` edges added between pairs of nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1`, where `u` and `v` are integers obtained from input.
