Output State: `beg` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `mid` is an integer. After all iterations of the loop, `beg` will be equal to `end`. This is because the loop continues to adjust `beg` and `end` until they converge, with `beg` being incremented and `end` being decremented based on the result of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. The final value of `mid` will be the same as `beg` and `end`, calculated as (`beg` + `end`) // 2 + 1 when `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true, or `beg` will be set to `mid` and `end` will be adjusted accordingly until they meet.
