Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but uses the variables `n`, `k`, and `tree`. It removes `k` edges from the tree structure represented by the `tree` object, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree. The function does not return any value.**

Note: The function does not accept `n`, `k`, and `tree` as parameters in the function definition but uses them within the function body.
