Output State: **`tree.vertices[v].good_components' is the original value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components' plus the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components', and `tree.vertices[u].good_components' remains unchanged`.**

This means that the value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to include the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, while the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` stays the same.
