Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The stack contains a series of pairs \((u_i, False)\) where each \(u_i\) is a child vertex of \(v\) from the tree. These pairs are added sequentially as the loop iterates over all children of \(v\). The postcondition is satisfied when the condition `postorder` is true.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components
    if tree.vertices[u].remaining_size >= x:
        tree.vertices[v].good_components += 1
    else:
        tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`, and `u` remains as the first child vertex of `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is additionally increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`, and `u` remains as the first child vertex of `v`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is additionally increased by 1. In the case where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size'` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size'`, and `tree.vertices[v].good_components'` is increased by the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components'`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `tree.vertices[v].good_components' is the original value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components' plus 1 if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size' is greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components' is the original value of `tree.vertices[v].good_components' plus the value of `tree.vertices[u].good_components', and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size' is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size'. `tree.vertices[u].good_components' remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
