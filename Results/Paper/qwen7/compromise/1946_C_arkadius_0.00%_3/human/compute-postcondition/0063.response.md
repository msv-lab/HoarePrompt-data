Output State: **`stack` contains tuples of all the vertices in the subtree rooted at `v`, with their second element set to `False`, `(postorder)` is true, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated by adding `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for each `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for each `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and the state of `tree.vertices[u]` for each `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children` remains unchanged.**

This means that the `remaining_size` attribute of `tree.vertices[v]` has been updated by adding the `remaining_size` values of all its children (`u`). All other conditions and states remain unchanged.
