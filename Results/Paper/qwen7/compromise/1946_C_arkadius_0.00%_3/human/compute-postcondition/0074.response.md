Output State: **The stack is now empty; `v` is the first element of the last pair popped from the stack, and `postorder` is the second element of the same pair.**

Explanation: The code `v, postorder = stack.pop()` pops the last pair from the stack and assigns the first element of the pair to `v` and the second element to `postorder`. After popping, the stack becomes empty.
