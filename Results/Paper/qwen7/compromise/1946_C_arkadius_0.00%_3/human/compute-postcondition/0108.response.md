Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, for every vertex `v` in the tree, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be the total count of good components for all descendants of `v`. A component is considered good if its remaining size (after removing some edges) is at least `x`.

Additionally, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be the sum of the remaining sizes of all descendant components of `v` whose remaining size is at least `x`.

This means that after the loop completes, every vertex `v` will have its `good_components` attribute set to the total number of good components in its subtree, and its `remaining_size` attribute will reflect the combined size of all good components in its subtree.
