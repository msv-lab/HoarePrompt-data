Output State: **`stack` contains tuples of all the vertices in the subtree rooted at `v`, with their second element set to `False`, `(postorder)` is true, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated by adding `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for each `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children`, and the state of `tree.vertices[u]` for each `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the `good_components` attribute of `tree.vertices[v]` by adding the `good_components` attribute of each child vertex `u` of `v`. The `stack`, `postorder`, and the state of `tree.vertices[u]` for each `u` in `tree.vertices[v].children` remain unchanged.
