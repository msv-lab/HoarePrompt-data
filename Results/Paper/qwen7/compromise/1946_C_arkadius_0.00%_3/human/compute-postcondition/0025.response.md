Output State: **The program returns the integer value of `mid` which is the same as both `beg` and `end` after they converge.**

This means that after the loop has adjusted `beg` and `end` until they meet, the final value of `mid` (which is calculated as (`beg` + `end`) // 2 + 1 when `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns true, or adjusted otherwise) is returned. Since `beg` is equal to `end` at the end of the loop, `mid` will also be equal to `beg` and `end`.
