Postcondition: **`stack` will contain tuples of all the vertices in the subtree rooted at `v`, with their second element set to `False`, (postorder) is true. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is equal to `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`, and `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`.**
