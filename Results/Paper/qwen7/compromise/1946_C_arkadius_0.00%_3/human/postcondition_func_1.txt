This function processes a tree structure to determine the number of "good components" and their sizes. A "good component" is defined as a subtree where the remaining size (number of vertices) is greater than or equal to a given minimum size `x` after removing exactly `k` edges. The function returns two values: `good_components`, which is the total count of such good components, and `remaining_size`, which is the cumulative size of these components. The function recursively traverses the tree, updating these counts based on the properties of each subtree.
