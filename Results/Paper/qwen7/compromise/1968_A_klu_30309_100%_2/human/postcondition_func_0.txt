The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers where each integer is between 2 and 1000. It returns a list of values, where each value is 1. Specifically, for each `x` in `test_cases`, the function determines that the value of `y` which maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y` is 1, and the maximum sum found is 3. After processing all elements in `test_cases`, the function returns a list of these values, all of which are 1.
