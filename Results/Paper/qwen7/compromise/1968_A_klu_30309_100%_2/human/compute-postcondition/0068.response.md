Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 2, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is 2, and `results` now contains 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `best_y` to the current value of `y`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
