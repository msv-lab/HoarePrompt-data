Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial state.
