Output State: The `results` list remains empty, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` contains the highest value of `current_sum` encountered during the loop's execution, `best_y` is the value of `y` that resulted in the highest `current_sum`, `x` remains unchanged, `y` iterates from `x - 1` down to 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and the current value of `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. The loop exits after checking all possible values of `y` from `x - 1` down to 1 for the given `x`.
