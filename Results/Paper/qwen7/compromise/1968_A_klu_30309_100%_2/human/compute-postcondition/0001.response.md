Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains three variables: `x`, `test_cases`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `test_cases`. Therefore, `test_cases` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `results` is not used in the loop head, its state does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `t` is not used in the loop head either, so its state does not need to be adjusted.
   - The variable `x` will take on the values from `test_cases` during each iteration of the loop. For the loop to start, `test_cases` must contain at least one element.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `test_cases` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` must have at least one element**
