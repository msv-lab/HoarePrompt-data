Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2, `best_y` is 1, and `results` now contains 1**

Explanation: The code updates `gcd_val` to be the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`. Given that `y` is 1, the gcd of any number `x` (which is at least 2) and 1 is 1. Thus, `gcd_val` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
