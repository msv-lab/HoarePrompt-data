Output State: **`max_sum` is 3, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `best_y` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates `gcd_val` to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y`. Given the initial values, `x` must be at least 2, and `y` is 1. The GCD of any number and 1 is 1. Therefore, `gcd_val` is updated to 1. The other variables (`max_sum`, `x`, `y`, and `best_y`) remain unchanged.
