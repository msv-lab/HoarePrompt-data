Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `x` is the same, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`**

Explanation: The code updates `current_sum` to be `gcd_val + y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
