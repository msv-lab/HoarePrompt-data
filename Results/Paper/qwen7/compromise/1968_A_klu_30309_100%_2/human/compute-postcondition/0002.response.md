Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `max_sum` to 0. The values of `results` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `results` is still an empty list, `t` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and `max_sum` is set to 0.
