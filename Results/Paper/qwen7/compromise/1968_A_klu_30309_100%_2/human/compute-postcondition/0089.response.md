Output State: **`max_sum` is 3, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2, `best_y` is 1, `results` contains 1 and 1.**

The code appends the value of `best_y` (which is 1) to the list `results`. Therefore, the list `results` now contains two elements: 1 and 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
