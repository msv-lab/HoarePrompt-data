Output State: **`max_sum` is now 2 + `y`, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is `y`**.

The code `best_y = y` assigns the current value of `y` to `best_y`. Since `y` is equal to `x`, `best_y` is also `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
