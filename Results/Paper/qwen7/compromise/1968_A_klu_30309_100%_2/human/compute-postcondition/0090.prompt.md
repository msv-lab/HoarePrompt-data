Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.
Code of the loop:
for x in test_cases:
    max_sum = 0
    best_y = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
        gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
        current_sum = gcd_val + y
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            best_y = y
            break
    results.append(best_y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is now [1], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` holds the highest sum of `gcd_val + y` found during the loop, `best_y` is the `y` value that produced this maximum sum, `x` is unchanged from its initial value, `y` is 1 (since it starts from `x-1` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1), `gcd_val` is 1 (since the GCD of any number and 1 is 1), `current_sum` is 2 (as `gcd_val` plus `y` equals 1 + 1), and the loop has finished executing.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `max_sum` remains 0, `x` remains 1 less than the length of `test_cases`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `y`, and `results` now contains `best_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `max_sum` is 3, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2, `best_y` is 1, `results` contains 1 and 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
