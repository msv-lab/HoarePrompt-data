Output State: **`max_sum` is now 2 + `y`, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is 1**

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to `current_sum`. Given that `current_sum` is defined as `2 + y`, `max_sum` is now also `2 + y`. All other variables (`x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, and `best_y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
