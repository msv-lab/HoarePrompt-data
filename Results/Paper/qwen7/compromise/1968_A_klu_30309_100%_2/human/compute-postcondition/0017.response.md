Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y`, `x` is the same, `y` is `y - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `best_y = y` updates the value of `best_y` to be equal to the current value of `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
