Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `y` is initialized to `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.**

The code calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd` function. Since `y` is initialized to `x - 1`, `x` and `y` are consecutive integers, and the greatest common divisor of any two consecutive integers is always 1. Therefore, `gcd_val` is set to 1. However, since the initial values of `x` and `y` are not specified, their exact values remain as per the initial state, and only `gcd_val` is updated to reflect the calculation.
