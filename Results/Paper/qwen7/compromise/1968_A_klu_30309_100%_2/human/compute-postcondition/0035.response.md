Output State: **`max_sum` remains 0, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x`, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2 + `y`, `best_y` is 1**.

Explanation: The code updates `current_sum` to be the sum of `gcd_val` (which is 1) and `y` (which is `x`). Since `y` is initially `x`, `current_sum` becomes `1 + x`. The other variables (`max_sum`, `gcd_val`, and `best_y`) remain unchanged.
