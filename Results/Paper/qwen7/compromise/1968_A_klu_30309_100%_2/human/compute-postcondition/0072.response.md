Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `y` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop will continue as long as `y` is in the range from `x-1` down to `1`. This means `y` starts from `x-1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`
   - `x` must be at least 2
   - `y` is 2
   - `gcd_val` is 1
   - `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`
   - `best_y` is 2
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `y` was 2 in the previous iteration and the loop decrements `y` by 1 each time, the next value of `y` would be `1`.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `x` stays the same.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `y` will be set to `1`.
   - `x` remains the same (at least 2).
   - Other variables (`max_sum`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`, `best_y`) are not directly affected by the loop itself and remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `x` must be at least 2, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `best_y` is 2**
