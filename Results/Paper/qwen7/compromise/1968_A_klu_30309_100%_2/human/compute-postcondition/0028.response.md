Output State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is the maximum value of `current_sum` found during the iterations, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value when `max_sum` was achieved, `x` remains the same as the initial value, `y` is 1 (since it starts from `x-1` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` (which is 1 when `y` is 1), `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y` (which is 2 when `y` is 1), and the loop has completed all its iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `results` list remains empty, `t` is still within the range of 1 to 1000, `max_sum` holds the highest sum of `gcd_val + y` found during the loop, `best_y` is the `y` value that produced this maximum sum, `x` is unchanged from its initial value, `y` is reduced to 1 (the lowest possible value in the range), `gcd_val` is 1 (since the GCD of any number and 1 is 1), `current_sum` is 2 (as `gcd_val` plus `y` equals 1 + 1), and the loop has finished executing.
