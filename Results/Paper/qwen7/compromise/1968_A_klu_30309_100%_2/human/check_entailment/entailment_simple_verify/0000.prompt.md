You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.

    #State: Output State: `results` is now a list containing the values `[1, 1, 1]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is 3, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2, and `best_y` is 1 after the loop has executed all iterations.
    #
    #This means that for each `x` in `test_cases`, the loop has determined that the value of `y` which maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y` is 1, and the maximum sum found was 3. The loop has iterated through all elements in `test_cases`, and `results` now contains the `best_y` value for each `x` in `test_cases`.
    return results
    #`results` is a list containing the values [1, 1, 1]



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \(1 \le y < x\). Specifically, the program breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds a \(y\) that gives a higher sum, but this does not guarantee that the found \(y\) will give the maximum possible sum. 

For example, consider \(x = 10\):
- The program checks \(y = 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\).
- For \(y = 9\), \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
- For \(y = 5\), \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).

In this case, both \(y = 9\) and \(y = 5\) give the maximum sum of 10. However, the program only returns \(y = 5\) because it breaks out of the loop after finding \(y = 5\), even though \(y = 9\) also gives the maximum sum. Therefore, the program does not always find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
