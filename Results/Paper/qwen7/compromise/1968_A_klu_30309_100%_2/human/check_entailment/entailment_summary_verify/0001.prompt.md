You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers where each integer is between 2 and 1000. It returns a list of values, where each value is 1. Specifically, for each `x` in `test_cases`, the function determines that the value of `y` which maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y` is 1, and the maximum sum found is 3. After processing all elements in `test_cases`, the function returns a list of these values, all of which are 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) plus \( y \) is maximized.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - It then reads each test case value \( x \).
   - For each \( x \), it iterates over all possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 1.
   - It calculates the GCD of \( x \) and \( y \) using `math.gcd`.
   - It keeps track of the maximum sum found so far (`max_sum`) and the corresponding \( y \) (`best_y`).
   - If a new maximum sum is found, it updates `max_sum` and `best_y`, and breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary computations.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( x = 2 \) correctly by returning \( y = 1 \).
   - For other values of \( x \), it finds the optimal \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the optimal \( y \) found for each \( x \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the integer \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for each test case \( x \). There are no apparent errors in the logic or implementation.

### Correctness:
**True**
