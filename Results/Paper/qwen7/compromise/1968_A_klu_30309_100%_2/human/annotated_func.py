#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        
        best_y = 1
        
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):

    #State: Output State: `results` is now a list containing the values `[1, 1, 1]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `max_sum` is 3, `x` is 0, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is 1, `current_sum` is 2, and `best_y` is 1 after the loop has executed all iterations.
    #
    #This means that for each `x` in `test_cases`, the loop has determined that the value of `y` which maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y` is 1, and the maximum sum found was 3. The loop has iterated through all elements in `test_cases`, and `results` now contains the `best_y` value for each `x` in `test_cases`.
    return results
    #`results` is a list containing the values [1, 1, 1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers where each integer is between 2 and 1000. It returns a list of values, where each value is 1. Specifically, for each `x` in `test_cases`, the function determines that the value of `y` which maximizes the sum of `gcd(x, y) + y` is 1, and the maximum sum found is 3. After processing all elements in `test_cases`, the function returns a list of these values, all of which are 1.
