Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, meaning it starts from the second element of the `numbers` list.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `hcf` is the GCD of `hcf` and `num`.
   - `num` is `numbers[1]`.

4. **Determine the next value of `num`**: Since the loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, the next value of `num` will be `numbers[2]`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `hcf` remains unchanged as it is computed within the loop body but not modified outside.
   - `num` changes to the next element in the list, which is `numbers[2]`.

6. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `hcf` is still the GCD of `hcf` and `num` (from the previous iteration).
   - `num` is now `numbers[2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `hcf` and `num`, and `num` is `numbers[2]`**.
