You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The list numbers contains n integers k_1, k_2, …, k_n such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `numbers`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `hcf` will hold the GCD of the entire list `numbers`. This is because the loop iteratively updates `hcf` to be the GCD of the current `hcf` value and the next element in the list, effectively combining all elements in the list through repeated application of the GCD operation.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list 'numbers'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
