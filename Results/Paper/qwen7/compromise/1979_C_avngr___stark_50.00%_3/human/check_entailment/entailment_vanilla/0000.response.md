Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculating the Product of Multipliers:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers `m = k[0] * k[1] * ... * k[n-1]`.
   - This step is correct and necessary to find the least common distribution factor.

3. **Finding the Distribution:**
   - It then computes `c[i] = m / k[i]` for each outcome.
   - This step ensures that the sum of `c[i]` values is maximized while still being less than `m / hcf`.

4. **Finding the HCF:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds the highest common factor (HCF) of the list `c`.
   - Dividing each element of `c` by the HCF ensures that the resulting values are co-prime and minimal.

5. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the adjusted `c` values is less than `m / hcf`.
   - If the sum is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`, it prints `-1` indicating no feasible solution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the adjusted `c` values.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where a feasible solution might not exist.
   - It ensures that the sum of bets is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `3 3 2 7`
  - Output: `27 41 12`
  - Calculation: `m = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`. Adjusted values: `c = [14, 21, 6]`. HCF = 1. Sum = 41 < 42, so valid.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `2 3 3`
  - Output: `1 1`
  - Calculation: `m = 3 * 3 = 9`. Adjusted values: `c = [3, 3]`. HCF = 3. Sum = 2 < 3, so valid.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `5 5 5 5 5`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Calculation: `m = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 3125`. No matter how you distribute, the sum will always be 3125, so invalid.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `6 7 9 3 17 9 13`
  - Output: `1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071`
  - Calculation: `m = 7 * 9 * 3 * 17 * 9 * 13 = 442353`. Adjusted values ensure the sum is less than 442353, so valid.

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `3 6 3 2`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Calculation: `m = 6 * 3 * 2 = 36`. No matter how you distribute, the sum will always be 36, so invalid.

- **Example 6:**
  - Input: `5 9 4 6 8 3`
  - Output: `8 18 12 9 24`
  - Calculation: `m = 9 * 4 * 6 * 8 * 3 = 3456`. Adjusted values ensure the sum is less than 3456, so valid.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find a feasible distribution of bets or determine if no such distribution exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
