Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the conversion of hours correctly for all cases. Specifically, it fails to convert the hour part of the time string properly. For instance, it incorrectly handles the hour '13' as '01 PM' instead of '01 AM'. This can be seen in the following example:

- Input: `13:00`
- Expected Output: `01:00 AM`
- Program Output: `01:00 PM`

This indicates that the program does not correctly convert the hours from 13 to 23 to their corresponding 12-hour format. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
