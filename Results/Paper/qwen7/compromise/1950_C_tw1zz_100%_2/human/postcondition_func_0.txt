The function processes multiple time inputs in the 24-hour format and converts them into the 12-hour format with AM/PM designations. For each input, it prints the converted time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM", where `h1` is the hour in the 12-hour format and `m` is the minute. The function reads the number of test cases from the first input, then for each test case, it takes a time string in the format "hh:mm", converts the hour part to the 12-hour format, and determines whether the time is in the morning (AM) or afternoon (PM).
