Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( a \). For each test case, it calculates and prints either \( a \times n \) or a more complex expression based on the values of \( n \) and \( a \), depending on whether \( b \) (which is not explicitly passed but derived from the input) is less than or equal to \( a \). If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \); otherwise, it prints \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k + (n - k) \times a\), where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \). The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
