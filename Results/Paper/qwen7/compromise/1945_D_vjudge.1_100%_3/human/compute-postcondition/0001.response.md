Output State: **`c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `0 ≤ i < n`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values; `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `suff` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `c`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values. The new list `suff` is created and initialized to all zeros.
