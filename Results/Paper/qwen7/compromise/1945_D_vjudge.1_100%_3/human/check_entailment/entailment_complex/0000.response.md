Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case as expected. It reads `n` and `k` for each test case, followed by lists `a` and `b` of length `n`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It constructs the list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
   - It computes the suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`.
   - It iterates through the first `k` positions to find the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for `0 â‰¤ i < k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is within the first `k` people in the queue.

Given the provided annotated program, the logic and steps taken to solve the problem are consistent with the problem statement. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required operations and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
