Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `n // 2`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n // 2 + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `pattern` is a list with elements `'B'`, `'AB'[i % 2]`, `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]`.

4. **Determine if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n // 2`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `n // 2 + 1`, it is not less than `n // 2`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute again.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop cannot execute again, no changes are needed for `i` or `n`.
   - The `pattern` list does not change based on the loop condition, so it remains the same.

Given this analysis, the states do not need to be adjusted because the loop cannot execute again.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n // 2 + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `pattern` is a list with elements `'B'`, `'AB'[i % 2]`, `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]`**
