Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n // 2`, and `pattern` is a list where every even index contains 'A' and every odd index contains 'B', `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `pattern`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
