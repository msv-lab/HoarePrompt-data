Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n // 2`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to `n // 2`.
   - The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n // 2`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n // 2`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n // 2` for the loop to run.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to `n // 2`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n // 2` for the loop to execute.
   - `n` must be a positive integer greater than 0 because `i` is set to `n // 2` and the loop will run as long as `i < n // 2`.

5. **Consider the given constraints**:
   - `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0. This variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `pattern` is an empty list, which is also not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be less than `n // 2`**
