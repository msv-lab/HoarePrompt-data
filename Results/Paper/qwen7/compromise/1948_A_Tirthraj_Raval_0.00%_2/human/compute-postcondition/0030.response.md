Output State: **`i` is `n // 2`, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is less than `n // 2`, `pattern` is a list with an additional element 'A' or 'B' based on the value of `i % 2` and now includes 'B'**.

Explanation: The code appends `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]` to the `pattern` list. Given that `i % 2` can be either 0 or 1, `i % 2 ^ 1` will be 1 if `i % 2` is 0, and 0 if `i % 2` is 1. Since `i % 2` is the same parity as the current last element in `pattern` (either 'A' or 'B'), `^ 1` will flip the last element. If the last element was 'A', it will become 'B', and vice versa. Therefore, the new element added to `pattern` is 'B'.
