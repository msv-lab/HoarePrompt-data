Output State: **`i` is 3; `pattern` is a list with elements 'B', 'A'**

Explanation: The code `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])` first calculates the value of `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `i % 2` is 1 (since 3 % 2 equals 1). The expression `1 ^ 1` evaluates to 0 (since XOR of 1 with itself is 0), and `'AB'[0]` is 'A'. Therefore, 'A' is appended to the list `pattern`. The initial value of `pattern` was ['B'], and after appending 'A', it becomes ['B', 'A']. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
