Output State: **t is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, after executing this line of code, `t` is now explicitly set to the input integer, which is the number of test cases. The other preconditions remain unchanged.
