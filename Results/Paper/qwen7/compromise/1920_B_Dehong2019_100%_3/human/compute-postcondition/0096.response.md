Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is `i + x + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by `2 * x * k`, `i + x` must be less than `n`**

Explanation: The line `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `t` are updated according to their respective conditions before this line of code. The condition `i + x` must be less than `n` remains unchanged as the code does not modify `n`.
