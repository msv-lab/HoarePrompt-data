Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `x`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0, while `n`, `k`, and `x` are now specific input integers.
