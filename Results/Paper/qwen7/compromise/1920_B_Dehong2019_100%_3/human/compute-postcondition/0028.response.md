Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `ans1` is updated by a specific formula involving `a[i + x]`.
   - `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `k` must be greater than 0.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, `k` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 4.
   - `k` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `ans1` and `ans2` are not directly affected by the loop condition but are part of the loop body, so their values remain as they are.
   - `i` becomes 4.
   - `k` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans1` is decreased by `2 * a[i + x] + a[0] + a[i] - a[i + x] * 2`, `ans2` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 4, and `k` must be greater than 3**.
