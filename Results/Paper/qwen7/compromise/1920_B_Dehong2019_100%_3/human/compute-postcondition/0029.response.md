Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[4]`, `i` is 5, `k` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is currently 4, `ans1` is increased by `a[4]`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1 (assuming the typical behavior of a loop where `i` is incremented after each iteration), making `i` equal to 5. The condition that `k` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged.
