Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `k`.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`.
   - `i` is updated to `i + x + 1`.
   - `k` must be greater than 0.
   - `t` is decreased by `2 * x * k`.
   - `i + x` must be less than `n`.
   - `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is updated to `i + x + 1`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + x + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + x + 1` must be less than `n`.
   - `k` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise (it must still be greater than 0).
   - `ans1` and `ans2` remain as they are since they are not directly affected by the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now `i + x + 1`.
   - `k` must still be greater than 0.
   - `i + x + 1` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is `i + x + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by `2 * x * k`, and `i + x + 1` must be less than `n`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**. 

However, since we only need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, the relevant states to adjust are:

State: **`i` is `i + x + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i + x + 1` must be less than `n`**.
