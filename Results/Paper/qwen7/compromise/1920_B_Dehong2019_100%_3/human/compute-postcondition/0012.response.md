Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a` multiplied by 2.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., for each `i` in the range from `0` to `x-1`), the variable `ans1` will be the initial value of `ans1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a`. This is because the loop subtracts `2 * a[i]` for each iteration, and it runs `x` times.
