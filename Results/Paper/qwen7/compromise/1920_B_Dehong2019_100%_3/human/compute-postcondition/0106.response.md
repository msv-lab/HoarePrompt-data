Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is `i + x + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i + x + 1` must be less than `n`; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The line `ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)` does not change the values of `ans1`, `i`, `k`, or the condition that `i + x + 1` must be less than `n`. It only updates `ans2` to be the maximum of its current value and `ans1`. Therefore, the updated state includes the changes from the previous operations and the new assignment to `ans2`.
