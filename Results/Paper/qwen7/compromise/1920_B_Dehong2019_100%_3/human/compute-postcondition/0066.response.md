Output State: **`ans1` is the previous value of `ans1` minus `a[i + x] * 2`, `i` is `x + 2`, `x` must be less than `k - 2`, and `n` must be such that `i + x < n` holds true; `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

This means that `ans1` has been updated to its previous value minus twice the value of `a[i + x]`, while `i` remains `x + 2`. The conditions on `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and `ans2` is still the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.
