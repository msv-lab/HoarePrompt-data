Postcondition: `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` is `i + x + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by `2 * x * k`, and `i + x` must be less than `n`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `2 * a[i + x]`. If `i + x >= n`, no additional changes occur to `ans1`, `i`, `k`, or `t`.
