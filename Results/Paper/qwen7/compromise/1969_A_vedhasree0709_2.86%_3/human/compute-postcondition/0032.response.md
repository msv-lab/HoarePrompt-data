Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are:
   - `_`: This is a dummy variable used to iterate over the range.
   - `int(input())`: This determines the number of iterations.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `j` is 0, indicating that the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was never met during the loop's execution.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if the condition `int(input()) > 0` is satisfied.
   - Since `_` is a dummy variable, it doesn't change within the loop.
   - The value of `int(input())` will determine how many times the loop will run.

Given that the loop will run one more time, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the new value of `int(input())` will be decremented by 1 from its previous value (since it just completed one iteration).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will still be equal to `n` because the loop variable `_` is a dummy and does not affect `i` or `n`.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `l` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` remains 0 as the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was never met during the loop's execution.

Since the loop will run one more time, the new value of `int(input())` will be the previous value minus 1.

**Final State**:
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `j` is 0, indicating that the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was never met during the loop's execution.
- `int(input())` will be the previous value minus 1.

State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0, and `int(input())` is the previous value minus 1**.
