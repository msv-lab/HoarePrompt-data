Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0.**

The variable `j` is assigned the value 0, while the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
