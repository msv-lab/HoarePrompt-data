Postcondition: `i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, and if `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
