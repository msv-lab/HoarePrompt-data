Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers converted from space-separated integers input by the user, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
