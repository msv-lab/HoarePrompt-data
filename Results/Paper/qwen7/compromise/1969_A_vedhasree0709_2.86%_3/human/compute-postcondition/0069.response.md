Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Determine the current state of variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.
   - Currently, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 4. Therefore, `0 <= n - 1` will always be true because `n - 1` is at least 3.

Since the loop condition `i <= n - 1` is already satisfied with the given values (`i = 0` and `n >= 4`), no adjustments are necessary.

**Conclusion**: No changes are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

**Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers converted from space-separated integers input by the user, `j` is 0**
