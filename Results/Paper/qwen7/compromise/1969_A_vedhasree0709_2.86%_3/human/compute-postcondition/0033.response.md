Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is the new input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0, and `int(input())` is the previous value minus 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes the previous value of `int(input())` (which is the previous value minus 1) and assigns it to `n`. The other variables (`i`, `t`, `l`, `j`) remain unchanged.
