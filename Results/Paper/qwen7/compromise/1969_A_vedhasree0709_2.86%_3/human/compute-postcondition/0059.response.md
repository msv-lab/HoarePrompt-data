Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is the total length of the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers, `j` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n`. Given that the loop condition is `i <= n - 1`, once `i` becomes equal to `n`, the loop will terminate. The variable `j` is set to 1 when the specified conditions inside the loop are met, and since these conditions do not depend on the number of iterations but rather on the elements of the list `l`, `j` remains 1 throughout the loop's execution. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `j` will still be 1.
