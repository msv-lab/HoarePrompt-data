Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers converted from space-separated integers input by the user, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
