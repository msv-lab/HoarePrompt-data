Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. It then computes a result based on a specific formula involving these counts and prints the result for each test case. The final state of the program includes the printed results for all test cases.**
