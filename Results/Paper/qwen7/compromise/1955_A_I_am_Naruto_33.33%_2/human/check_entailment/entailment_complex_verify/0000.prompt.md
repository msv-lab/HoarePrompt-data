You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, where n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the price for one yogurt, and b is the price for two yogurts on promotion.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of minimum costs for purchasing different numbers of yogurts based on the given conditions. For each test case, if buying more than one yogurt, the program calculates the cost of buying each yogurt individually (ans1) or buying them in pairs with a promotion (ans2), then prints the lower of the two costs. If buying just one yogurt, it simply prints the cost of one yogurt. The process repeats for each test case provided by the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of yogurts `n`, the price for one yogurt `a`, and the price for two yogurts on promotion `b`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts either by buying them individually or in pairs, depending on which option is cheaper. It then prints the minimum cost for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where buying in pairs (using the promotion price) is more advantageous than buying individually, especially when `n` is odd. 

For example, in the third test case of the provided example (3 5 11), the program calculates the cost as follows:
- `ans1 = a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`
- `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`

However, the correct minimum cost should be 15, which is achieved by buying two yogurts at the promotion price (11 burles) and one yogurt at the regular price (5 burles). The program incorrectly calculates `ans2` because it does not handle the case where the number of yogurts is odd and the promotion price is more beneficial.

To fix this, the program should adjust the calculation of `ans2` to ensure it correctly handles the case where the number of yogurts is odd.
