Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy \( n \) yogurts. Here's a breakdown:

1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
3. If \( n > 1 \):
   - It calculates the cost of buying all yogurts individually (`ans1 = a * n`).
   - It calculates the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible plus any remaining individual yogurts (`ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`).
   - It prints the minimum of these two costs.
4. If \( n = 1 \), it simply prints the cost of one yogurt (`a`).

This approach ensures that Maxim buys the yogurts in the most cost-effective manner. The logic handles both scenarios where buying in pairs is beneficial and where buying individually is better.

Given the explanation and the provided execution summary, the program appears to be correct and follows the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
