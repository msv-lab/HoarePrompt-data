Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `ans` is `k * b`**.

The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `k * b` to its current value. Since the initial value of `ans` is 0, after executing `ans += k * b`, `ans` becomes `k * b`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
