Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, followed by the necessary inputs for each test case: the size of the array `n`, the modulus value `m`, the array `a`, and the sequence of commands `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `b` to store intermediate results and two pointers `l` and `r` to track the start and end of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the commands in `s` and appends the appropriate element from `a` to `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - After constructing `b`, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and stores these products in the list `ans`.

3. **Reversing the Product List**:
   - The function returns the reversed list `ans`, which contains the required outputs in the correct order.

4. **Output**:
   - The main program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the output is in the correct format.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` matches the requirements. The function correctly processes the commands, updates the array `a`, and computes the required remainders.

Correctness: **True**
