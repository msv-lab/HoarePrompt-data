Reasoning:
1. The program correctly processes each command in the string `s` by appending the appropriate element from the list `a` to a new list `b`.
2. However, there is a critical issue with how the product calculation is handled. The program should calculate the product of the remaining elements in the list `a` after each removal, but instead, it incorrectly constructs a new list `b` and calculates the cumulative product of this list.
3. The function `func_1` does not reflect the actual problem requirements. It appends elements from `a` to `b` based on the direction specified in `s`, but it does not perform the required operations of calculating the product of the remaining elements in `a` after each removal.
4. The final step of reversing `ans` before returning does not address the core issue of calculating the correct product after each removal.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
