You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the specified logic.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `a` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle the product calculation and the removal of elements as per the problem statement.

3. **Current Implementation of `func_1`:**
   - It initializes an empty list `b` and uses indices `l` and `r` to track the left and right boundaries of the array `a`.
   - Instead of calculating the product of the remaining elements in the array, it incorrectly appends the elements at positions `l` and `r` to `b` without removing them from `a`.
   - It then calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and appends these products to `ans`.

4. **Correct Logic:**
   - We need to maintain the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` and update this product as elements are removed.
   - After processing each command, we should append the current product modulo `m` to the result list.

### Corrected Implementation:

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    prod = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the product of the remaining elements
        for j in range(i):
            prod = (prod * a[j]) % m
        
        # Process the command
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)  # Remove the leftmost element
        else:
            a.pop()   # Remove the rightmost element
        
        # Append the current product modulo m
        b.append(prod)
    
    return b
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `prod` is initialized to 1 to store the product of the remaining elements.
   - `b` is used to store the results.

2. **Loop through each command:**
   - For each command, calculate the product of the remaining elements up to the current index `i`.
   - Update the product modulo `m` after each command.
   - Remove the appropriate element from the array `a` based on the command (`L` or `R`).
   - Append the current product modulo `m` to the result list `b`.

3. **Return the result:**
   - Return the list `b` containing the required remainders.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the product calculation and the removal of elements. The corrected implementation above should be used instead.

**Correctness: False**
