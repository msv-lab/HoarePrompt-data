Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list that is the reverse of `ans`, where `ans` is a list of length `n` with each element being the cumulative product of the reversed list `b`, starting from the first element, and `p` is the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`.**

- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq m \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

The function constructs a reversed list `b` from `a`, calculates the cumulative product of `b` starting from the first element, and then returns the reverse of this cumulative product list.
