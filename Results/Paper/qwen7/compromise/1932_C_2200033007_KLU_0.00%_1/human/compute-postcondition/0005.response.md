Output State: `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the corresponding character in `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', then `b[i]` is `a[l]` and `l` is incremented. If `s[i]` is 'R', then `b[i]` is `a[r]` and `r` is decremented. The final values of `l` and `r` will be `n-1` and 0 respectively after the loop completes.
