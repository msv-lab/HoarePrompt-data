Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` and `func_2` do not fully account for the requirements of accommodating introverts, extroverts, and universals correctly.

Here's why the correctness is False:

1. **Handling Introverts**: The function `func_2` directly calls `func_1` which handles extroverts and universals but does not allocate tents for introverts separately. Since each introvert needs a tent alone, `func_2` should ensure that the number of tents allocated to extroverts and universals does not conflict with the requirement for introverts.

2. **Edge Cases**: The function `func_1` has a flaw where it checks if `extroverts % 3 != 0` and then checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`. This logic is insufficient because it doesn't properly account for the remaining universals after allocating tents to extroverts.

3. **Calculation of Tents**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`, which is a good start but needs to be adjusted to ensure that all introverts get their own tents.

To fix these issues, you need to adjust the functions to properly allocate tents for introverts and ensure that the total number of tents is minimized while respecting all constraints. Hereâ€™s a revised approach:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals
    tents_needed = ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
    return tents_needed

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    # Allocate tents for introverts
    tents_for_introverts = introverts
    # Allocate remaining tents for extroverts and universals
    remaining_universals = universals
    remaining_extroverts = extroverts
    # Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals
    tents_for_others = func_1(remaining_extroverts, remaining_universals)
    # Ensure we don't exceed the total number of universals
    if remaining_universals < 2 * (tents_for_others - 1):
        return -1
    return tents_for_introverts + tents_for_others

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().strip().split())
        print(func_2(a, b, c))
```

This revised code ensures that introverts get their own tents and that the allocation of tents for extroverts and universals respects the constraints.
