### Reasoning:

Let's break down the logic of the provided program to determine its correctness.

1. **Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**:
   - This function aims to calculate the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - The key logic here is:
     - If the number of extroverts (`extroverts`) is not divisible by 3, check if adding the number of universals (`universals`) to the extroverts is enough to form complete groups of 3.
     - If the condition `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` is true, it means we cannot form at least one group of 3, so the function returns `None`.
     - Otherwise, the function calculates the number of tents required using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

2. **Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required for all participants.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to form groups of 3, the function returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (`introverts`) to the result from `func_1` and returns the total.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The function `func_1` correctly handles the logic for forming groups of 3 with extroverts and universals.
- The function `func_2` correctly uses the result from `func_1` to account for introverts and handle the case where it's impossible to form groups of 3.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the logic in `func_1` and `func_2`:

1. **Function `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**:
   - The condition `if extroverts % 3 != 0:` checks if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3.
   - The condition `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:` checks if the remaining extroverts plus universals are less than 3.
   - If these conditions hold, the function returns `None`. However, this logic is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that if `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it's impossible to form groups of 3. This is not always true; for example, if `extroverts % 3 == 1` and `universals == 1`, we can still form one group of 3.

2. **Function `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**:
   - The function calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` and handles the return value correctly.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed as explained above, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `1 2 3`
   - `func_1(2, 3)` returns `2` because 2 extroverts and 3 universals can form 2 groups of 3.
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 2 (from func_1) = 3`.

2. **Test Case 2**: `1 4 1`
   - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `2` because 4 extroverts and 1 universal can form 2 groups of 3.
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 2 (from func_1) = 3`.
   - However, the output is `-1` because the remaining extrovert cannot form a group of 3.

3. **Test Case 3**: `1 4 2`
   - `func_1(4, 2)` returns `2` because 4 extroverts and 2 universals can form 2 groups of 3.
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 2 (from func_1) = 3`.

4. **Test Case 4**: `1 1 1`
   - `func_1(1, 1)` returns `1` because 1 extrovert and 1 universal can form 1 group of 3.
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 1 (from func_1) = 2`.
   - However, the output is `-1` because the remaining extrovert cannot form a group of 3.

5. **Test Case 5**: `1 3 2`
   - `func_1(3, 2)` returns `2` because 3 extroverts and 2 universals can form 2 groups of 3.
   - Total tents: `1 (introvert) + 2 (from func_1) = 3`.

6. **Test Case 6**: `19 7 18`
   - `func_1(7, 18)` returns `9` because 7 extroverts and 18 universals can form 9 groups of 3.
   - Total tents: `19 (introverts) + 9 (from func_1) = 28`.

### Conclusion:

The program logic is flawed due to the incorrect handling of the conditions in `func_1`. Specifically, the condition `if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:` is too restrictive and leads to incorrect results in some cases.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
