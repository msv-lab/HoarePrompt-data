Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Array `b` Construction**: The array `b` is constructed such that `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of values where each value is either 1 or 2. This does not satisfy the requirement that `b_i > 0` and `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i`.

2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `a[y] - a[x-1] >= b[y] - b[x-1]` for each query. However, this condition does not guarantee that a subarray is "good". Specifically, it does not ensure that `b_i > 0` and `a_i ≠ b_i` for every index `i`.

3. **Output Logic**: The program always prints 'NO' unless `x == y`, which is not a valid approach to determine if a subarray is "good".

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
