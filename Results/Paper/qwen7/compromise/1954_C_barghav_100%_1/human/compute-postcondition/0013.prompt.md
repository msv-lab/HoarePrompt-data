You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings of equal length consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `f` is 1, `x` is a string of digits, `y` is a string of digits, `a` is a list of characters from `x` sorted in non-decreasing order compared to the corresponding characters in `b`, `b` is a list of characters from `y`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop compares each character in list `a` with the corresponding character in list `b`. If the character in `a` is less than the character in `b`, it swaps them and sets `f` to 1. If the character in `a` is greater than the character in `b`, it sets `f` to 1. If `f` is 1 at the end of the loop, it means there was at least one swap, indicating that the lists `a` and `b` were not already in the desired order. The lists `a` and `b` will be sorted in such a way that for every pair of elements, the element from `a` is not greater than the corresponding element from `b`.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: `f` is 0, `x` is a string of digits, `y` is a string of digits, `a` is a list of characters from `x` sorted in non-decreasing order compared to the corresponding characters in `b`, `b` is a list of characters from `y`, and the loop prints each character in list `a` on a new line.
    print()
    #This is printed: a newline
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: The output state will be the contents of list `b`, printed on separate lines in the order they appear in `b`.
    print()
    #This is printed: nothing
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether two given strings of equal length consisting of digits from 1 to 9 are equal.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
