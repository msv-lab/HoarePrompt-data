Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the product of two numbers by swapping their digits.
2. The provided solution attempts to sort the digits of the first number (`a`) in such a way that they are greater than or equal to the corresponding digits in the second number (`b`).
3. However, the logic in `func_1()` is flawed:
   - It does not actually sort the digits of `a` relative to `b`. Instead, it performs swaps based on a flag `f`, which is not correctly implemented to achieve the goal.
   - The flag `f` is used incorrectly. It is supposed to indicate whether a swap has occurred, but the logic for setting and using this flag is flawed.
4. The current implementation does not ensure that the digits of `a` are maximized relative to the corresponding digits in `b`.
5. The output format is also incorrect. The function prints the modified `a` and `b` directly without ensuring that the maximum product condition is met.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
