Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is an empty list, `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**.

The code assigns the value of `Max` to `number`. Since `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` now holds the same value as `Max`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
