Let's break down the loop head conditions and the current state to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Loop Head Conditions:
1. `n != 0`
2. `k > 0`
3. `rep < 60`
4. `n >= k`

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `rep` is 2
- `n` is `n - Min * Max`
- `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on the condition
- `Min` is updated to `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)` or `min(n // (k - Min), k - Min)`
- `Max` is updated to `max(int((n - Min * Max) / (k - Max)), k - Max)` or `max(int(n / (k - Min)), k - Min)`
- `number` is either `Min` or `Max`
- `tab` is a list containing `str(number)` appended
- `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition `n != 0`:**
   - This condition checks if `n` is non-zero. Since `n` was reduced by `Min * Max` in the last iteration, `n` should still be non-zero for the loop to continue.

2. **Condition `k > 0`:**
   - This condition checks if `k` is greater than zero. The value of `k` could have been reduced by `Max` or `Min` in the last iteration. Therefore, `k` must be greater than zero for the loop to continue.

3. **Condition `rep < 60`:**
   - This condition checks if `rep` is less than 60. Since `rep` was set to 2 in the last iteration, it should still be less than 60 for the loop to continue.

4. **Condition `n >= k`:**
   - This condition checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. The values of `n` and `k` were updated based on the previous calculations. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

### Adjusting States:
- **`rep`**: It should be less than 60, but since it was 2, it will remain valid.
- **`n`**: It should be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`. Since `n` was reduced by `Min * Max`, it must still be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`.
- **`k`**: It should be greater than zero. Since `k` could have been reduced by `Max` or `Min`, it must still be greater than zero.
- **`Min` and `Max`**: These values are updated based on the calculations involving `n` and `k`, so they don't need to be explicitly adjusted.
- **`number`**: This value is either `Min` or `Max`, so it doesn't affect the loop conditions.
- **`tab`**: This list is updated based on `number`, so it doesn't affect the loop conditions.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`.
- `k` must be greater than zero.
- `rep` must be less than 60, but since it was 2, this condition is already satisfied.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60**
