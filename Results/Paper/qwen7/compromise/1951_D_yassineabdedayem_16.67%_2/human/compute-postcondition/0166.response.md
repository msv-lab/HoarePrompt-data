Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `tab`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the list `tab`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `tab` is a list that must have at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `tab` has at least one element, for the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must still have at least one element.
   - Additionally, the variable `i` will be set to the next element in the list `tab`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `tab` still has at least one element and `i` will be set to the next element in the list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tab` is a list that must have at least one element, and `i` will be the next element in the list**.
