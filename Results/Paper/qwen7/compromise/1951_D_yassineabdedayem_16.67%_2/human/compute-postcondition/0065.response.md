Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is a non-zero integer, `k` is a positive integer, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `Min` and `Max` based on the expressions involving `n` and `k`. Specifically, `Min` is set to the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, while `Max` is set to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
