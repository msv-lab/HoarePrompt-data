Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `t`, but since `t` is not explicitly mentioned in the given state, we need to infer its role.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `rep` is 60
   - `n` is 0
   - `k` is a non-positive integer
   - `Min` is 0
   - `Max` is 0
   - `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values from each iteration

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, and `t` is not explicitly stated, we need to assume that `t` is the number of iterations that have already occurred. Given that `rep` is 60, it suggests that `t` might be 60.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `rep` is 60, it implies that `t` is currently 60, and for the loop to execute one more time, `t` should be 61.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `rep` remains 60 because it is not directly controlled by the loop.
   - `n` remains 0 because it is not directly controlled by the loop.
   - `k` remains a non-positive integer because it is not directly controlled by the loop.
   - `Min` remains 0 because it is not directly controlled by the loop.
   - `Max` remains 0 because it is not directly controlled by the loop.
   - `number` remains the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration because it is not directly controlled by the loop.
   - `tab` remains a list containing the string representations of all `number` values from each iteration because it is not directly controlled by the loop.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is a non-positive integer, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values from each iteration, and `t` is 61**.
