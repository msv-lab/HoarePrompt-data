Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is `k - Max`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int((n - Min * Max) / (k - Max)), k - Max)`, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is a list containing `str(number)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is decreased by `Max`.
- The values of `Min` and `Max` are updated based on the new value of `k`. Specifically, `Min` is updated to `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)`, and `Max` is updated to `max(int((n - Min * Max) / (k - Max)), k - Max)`.
- All other variables (`rep`, `n`, `number`, and `tab`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
