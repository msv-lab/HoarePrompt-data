Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged and are still positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
    rep = 0
    number = 0
    tab = []
    while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
        Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
        if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
            number = Min
            k = k - Max
        else:
            number = Max
            k = k - Min
        tab.append(str(number))
        n -= Min * Max
        rep += 1
    if k == 0:
        print('YES')
        print(len(tab))
        for i in tab:
            print(i, end=' ')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is either 0 or greater than 0, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` after each iteration, which will have 60 elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is a non-positive integer, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values from each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tab` is a list that contains the string representations of numbers from 0 to 59 inclusive, and `i` will be the next element in the list when the loop finishes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
