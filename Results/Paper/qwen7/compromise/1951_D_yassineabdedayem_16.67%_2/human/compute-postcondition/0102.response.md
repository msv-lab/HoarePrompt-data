Output State: `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `k` is a non-positive integer (since the loop exits when `k` is no longer greater than 0), `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, which is 0 because `n` is 0, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, which is also 0, `number` is the last value appended to `tab` during the 60th iteration, and `tab` is a list containing the string representations of all `number` values from each iteration.

In this final state, `rep` reaches its maximum limit of 60, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `n` is 0 as it gets reduced to 0 over the iterations. Since the loop exits when `k` is no longer greater than 0, `k` becomes non-positive. The `Min` and `Max` values are both 0 because `n` is 0. The `number` value is determined by the last iteration's conditions and is appended to `tab`. `tab` contains all the `number` values from each iteration, represented as strings.
