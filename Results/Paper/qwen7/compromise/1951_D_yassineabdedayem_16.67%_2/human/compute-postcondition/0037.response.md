Output State: **`rep` is increased by 1, `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting `Min` from it, `number` is `Max`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than zero, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - Min` decreases the value of `k` by `Min`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `k` which is `k - Min`.
