Output State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Max`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `Max` to the variable `number`. `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `int(n / k)` will be at least 1. Therefore, `Max` will be the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The other conditions and definitions remain unchanged.
