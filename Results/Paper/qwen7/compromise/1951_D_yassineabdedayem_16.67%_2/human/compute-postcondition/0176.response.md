Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each t, two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) are provided. Based on these inputs, the function returns different outputs for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a value for `t`, and within each test case, two values `n` and `k`. The function does not accept `n` and `k` directly as parameters but uses them internally to produce an output for each test case.
