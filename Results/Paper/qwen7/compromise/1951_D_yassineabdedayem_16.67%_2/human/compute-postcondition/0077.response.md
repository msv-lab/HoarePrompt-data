Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is a non-zero integer - `Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `Min` is `min(n // (k - min(n // k, k)), k - min(n // k, k))`, `Max` is `max(int(n / (k - min(n // k, k))), k - min(n // k, k))`, `number` is `max(int(n / (k - min(n // k, k))), k - min(n // k, k))`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decreased by the product of `Min` and `Max`. All other variables retain their original expressions or values. Specifically, `Min` and `Max` are defined based on the current value of `n` and `k`, and `number` and `tab` are derived from `Max`.
