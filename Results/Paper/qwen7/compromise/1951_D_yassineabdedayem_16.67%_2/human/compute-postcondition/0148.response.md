Output State: **`rep` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on the condition, `Min` is updated to `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)` or `min(n // (k - Min), k - Min)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int((n - Min * Max) / (k - Max)), k - Max)` or `max(int(n / (k - Min)), k - Min)`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max`, `tab` is a list containing `str(number)` appended, `n` is reduced by `Min * Max`.**

Explanation: The variable `rep` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`, and `tab`) remain unchanged in terms of their expressions and conditions. The values of `n` and `Max` are reduced by `Min * Max`, and `Min` and `Max` are updated based on the conditions provided, but no specific numerical values are given for these updates.
