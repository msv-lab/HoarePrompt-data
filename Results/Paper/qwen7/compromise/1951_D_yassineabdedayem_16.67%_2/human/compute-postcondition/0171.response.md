Output State: **`tab` is a list that contains the string representations of numbers from 0 to 59 inclusive, and `i` will be the next element in the list when the loop finishes.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `tab` will be a list containing the string representations of numbers from "0" to "59" inclusive. The variable `i` will be set to the next element in the list, which would be "60" since the loop has processed all elements from "0" to "59".
