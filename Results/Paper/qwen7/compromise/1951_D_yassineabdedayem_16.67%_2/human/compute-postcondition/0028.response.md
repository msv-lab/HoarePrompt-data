Output State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `number` is `min(n // k, k) - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`, `k` is adjusted by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` accordingly, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `rep`, `Max`, `Min`, and `number` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
- The value of `k` is adjusted by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` accordingly, as per the initial conditions.
- A new element, which is the string representation of `number`, is added to the list `tab`.
