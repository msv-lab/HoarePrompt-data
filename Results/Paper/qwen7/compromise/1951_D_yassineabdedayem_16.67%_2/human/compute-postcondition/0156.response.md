Output State: **`n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is decreased by `Min`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`. The value of `number` is determined based on certain conditions involving `n` and `k`. After appending, the values of `n`, `k`, `number`, `Min`, and `Max` are updated according to the given rules, while `tab` now contains the string representation of `number`.
