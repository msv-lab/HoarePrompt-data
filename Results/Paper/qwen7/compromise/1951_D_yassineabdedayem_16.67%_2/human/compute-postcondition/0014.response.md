Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` must not be 0, `k` must be greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Max`, and `k` is `k - Min`.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - Min` subtracts the value of `Min` from `k`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, the new value of `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
