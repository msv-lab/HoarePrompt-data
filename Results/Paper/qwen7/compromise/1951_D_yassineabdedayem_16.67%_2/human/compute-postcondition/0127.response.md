Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `k` is a positive integer, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min`, `tab` is an empty list, `t` is 61, `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `Min` to `number`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, `number` now holds the value of `Min`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or updated states.
