Output: **60**

Explanation:
- `tab` is a list containing the string representations of numbers from the loop iterations.
- Since the initial state does not mention any loop or process that would modify `tab`, we assume `tab` contains 60 elements (from the string representations of numbers, likely starting from "0" to "59").
- Therefore, `len(tab)` will return the number of elements in `tab`, which is 60.
- Hence, the print statement will output **60**.
