Postcondition: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `number` is `min(n // k, k) - Max` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`, and `k` is adjusted by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` accordingly.**
