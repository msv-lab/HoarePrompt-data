Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each representing the output of one test case. For each test case, if the input string `s` has a length greater than 1 and contains more than one unique character, it will print 'Yes' followed by a permutation of the string `s`. If the string `s` has a length of 1 or contains only one unique character, it will print 'No'. The exact permutations printed for each valid string `s` will vary due to the random sampling in the code.
