The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` has a length greater than 1 and contains more than one unique character. If so, it prints 'Yes' followed by a randomly permuted version of the string `s`. If the string `s` has a length of 1 or contains only one unique character, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
