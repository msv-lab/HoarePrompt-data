The function processes a series of test cases (up to 10,000). For each test case, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(y\) (both between 0 and 99). Based on the values of \(x\) and \(y\), it calculates and prints one of the following:
- The sum of \(\left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil\) and \(\left\lceil \frac{x - \left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil \times 15 + y \times 4}{15} \right\rceil\) if both \(x\) and \(y\) are positive.
- \(\left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil\) if only \(y\) is positive.
- \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{15} \right\rceil\) if only \(x\) is positive.
- 0 if both \(x\) and \(y\) are zero.
