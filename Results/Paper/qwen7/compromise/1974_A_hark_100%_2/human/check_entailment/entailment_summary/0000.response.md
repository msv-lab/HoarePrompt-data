Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic used in the program matches the requirements specified in the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the program step-by-step:

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Find the minimum number of screens required to place all icons (both 1x1 and 2x2) on the grid.
2. **Grid Size**: Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means each screen can hold up to 15 icons (since 5 rows * 3 columns = 15 cells).
3. **Icon Placement**:
   - A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
4. **Constraints**: 
   - \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\)
   - \(t \leq 10^4\)

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It processes a series of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(y\).
   - It calculates the minimum number of screens required using different conditions based on the values of \(x\) and \(y\).

#### Conditions in the Program:
1. **Both \(x\) and \(y\) are positive**:
   - Calculate \(\left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil\) (number of 2x2 icons that can fit).
   - Adjust \(x\) by subtracting the space taken by these 2x2 icons.
   - Calculate \(\left\lceil \frac{x - \left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil \times 15 + y \times 4}{15} \right\rceil\) (remaining 1x1 icons that can fit).
   - Sum the results and print.

2. **Only \(y\) is positive**:
   - Calculate \(\left\lceil \frac{y}{2} \right\rceil\) (number of 2x2 icons that can fit).
   - Print the result.

3. **Only \(x\) is positive**:
   - Calculate \(\left\lceil \frac{x}{15} \right\rceil\) (number of 1x1 icons that can fit).
   - Print the result.

4. **Both \(x\) and \(y\) are zero**:
   - Print 0.

### Verification:
Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1**: \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\)
   - \(\left\lceil \frac{1}{2} \right\rceil = 1\)
   - \(x = 1 - 1 \times 15 + 1 \times 4 = 1 - 15 + 4 = -10\) (invalid, should be 0)
   - \(\left\lceil \frac{0}{15} \right\rceil = 0\)
   - Result: \(1 + 0 = 1\)

2. **Test Case 2**: \(x = 7\), \(y = 2\)
   - \(\left\lceil \frac{2}{2} \right\rceil = 1\)
   - \(x = 7 - 1 \times 15 + 2 \times 4 = 7 - 15 + 8 = 0\)
   - \(\left\lceil \frac{0}{15} \right\rceil = 0\)
   - Result: \(1 + 0 = 1\)

3. **Test Case 3**: \(x = 12\), \(y = 4\)
   - \(\left\lceil \frac{4}{2} \right\rceil = 2\)
   - \(x = 12 - 2 \times 15 + 4 \times 4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2\)
   - \(\left\lceil \frac{-2}{15} \right\rceil = 0\)
   - Result: \(2 + 0 = 2\)

From the analysis, the program logic seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for each test case based on the given constraints and examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
