Output State: **The program prints 'Bob' to the console**

The code snippet `return print('Bob')` does not return a value but instead calls the `print` function to output 'Bob' to the console. Therefore, there is no value being returned in the traditional sense, but rather an action (printing 'Bob') being performed.
