You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it calls another function `func_2()`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any specific value and leaves the original variables (x and y) unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of two values `a` and `b`.
   - It is not used in the main logic of the program, so we can ignore it for now.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes input values `x` and `y`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - The logic inside `func_2` is complex and involves several calculations:
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates how many 2x2 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing the maximum possible 2x2 icons.
     - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` adjusts the count of 1x1 icons based on the placement of 2x2 icons.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using `func_2`.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over them.

### Detailed Analysis of Logic

- **Case 1**: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
  - The calculation `math.ceil(y / 2)` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and there are 15 cells available per screen.
  - The adjustment `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` ensures that the remaining 1x1 icons are recalculated after placing the 2x2 icons.
  - The final calculation `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is correct for determining the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

- **Case 2**: Only `y` is greater than 0.
  - The logic `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and there are 15 cells available per screen.

- **Case 3**: Only `x` is greater than 0.
  - The logic `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` is correct because each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell, and there are 15 cells available per screen.

- **Case 4**: Both `x` and `y` are 0.
  - The logic `print(0)` is correct because no icons need to be placed.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the logic, it appears that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for different combinations of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The calculations and conditions are handled appropriately.
