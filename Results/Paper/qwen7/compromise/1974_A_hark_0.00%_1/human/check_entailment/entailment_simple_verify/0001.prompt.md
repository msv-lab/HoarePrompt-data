You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

After the loop executes all the iterations, no other variables are affected by the loop, so their states remain unchanged. The loop itself does not change any variable's value; it only calls `func_2()` for `t` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of two values `a` and `b`.
   - It is not used in the main logic of the program, so we can ignore it for now.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes input values `x` and `y`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - The logic inside `func_2` is complex and involves several calculations:
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates how many 2x2 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing the maximum possible 2x2 icons.
     - `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` adjusts the count of 1x1 icons based on the placement of 2x2 icons.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - Finally, it prints the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using `func_2`.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over them.

### Detailed Analysis of Logic

- **Case 1**: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
  - The calculation `math.ceil(y / 2)` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and there are 15 cells available per screen.
  - The adjustment `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` ensures that the remaining 1x1 icons are recalculated after placing the 2x2 icons.
  - The final calculation `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is correct for determining the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

- **Case 2**: Only `y` is greater than 0.
  - The logic `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and there are 15 cells available per screen.

- **Case 3**: Only `x` is greater than 0.
  - The logic `print(math.ceil(x / 15))` is correct because each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell, and there are 15 cells available per screen.

- **Case 4**: Both `x` and `y` are 0.
  - The logic `print(0)` is correct because no icons need to be placed.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the logic, it appears that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for different combinations of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The calculations and conditions are handled appropriately.
