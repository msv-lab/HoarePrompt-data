You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
        
    #State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the final value of `t` is 0. `n` is the length of the list `a`, which may vary depending on the input. `check_all` remains unchanged from its last known state, and `i` is now equal to `n`. If the loop did not break early, `check_all` will be `True`, meaning all elements in `a` satisfy the condition `a[i-1] <= a[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`. If the loop breaks early, `check_all` will be `False`, indicating that there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in `a` that does not satisfy the condition.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next element). If the list is non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'. If not, it checks if the list can be split into two parts where the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing. If such a split exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It then reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The program uses `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position where the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is violated.
   - For each such position, it splits the array into two parts: `x = a[:i]` and `y = a[i:]`.
   - It then checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping these two parts.
     - `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the second part.
     - `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])` checks if the second part is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such split satisfies the conditions, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - This part of the code correctly identifies if the array is already sorted, which is a valid scenario where no operation is needed.

2. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - The logic for splitting the array and checking the conditions is correct.
   - The program correctly identifies if a valid split exists that can make the array non-decreasing.
   - The program handles all edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts of the array.

**Correctness: True**
