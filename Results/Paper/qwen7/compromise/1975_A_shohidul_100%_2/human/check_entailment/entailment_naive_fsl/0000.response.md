Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider all possible ways to split the array and check if it can become non-decreasing after swapping the parts.

Consider the following test case:
```
4
3
1 2 3
2
2 1
3
1 3 2
4
4 5 1 4
```

- For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the program correctly outputs `YES`.
- For the input `[2, 1]`, the program correctly outputs `NO`.
- For the input `[1, 3, 2]`, the program should output `YES` because we can split it into `[1]` and `[3, 2]`, and then swap them to get `[3, 2, 1]`, but the program incorrectly outputs `NO`.

The program only checks the initial condition and a limited number of splits, which is insufficient to cover all possible valid splits that could make the array non-decreasing. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
