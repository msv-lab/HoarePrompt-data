Output State: **`i` is 3; `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of `a`; `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`; `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the most internal loop or if statement has been exited. All other variables retain their initial states.
