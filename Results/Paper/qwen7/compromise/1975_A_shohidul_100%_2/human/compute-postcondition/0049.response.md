Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input from the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the value of `n` is now set to the integer input provided by the user.
