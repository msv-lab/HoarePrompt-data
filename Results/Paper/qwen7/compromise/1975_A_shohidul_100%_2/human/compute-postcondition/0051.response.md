Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `check_all` is True if all elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 are less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `check_all` is False.**

This means that `check_all` is determined by checking if every element in the list `a` (from the first element to the second last element) is less than or equal to the next element. If this condition holds true for all such pairs, `check_all` is set to `True`; otherwise, it is set to `False`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
