Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is True if all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within the given code snippet, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
