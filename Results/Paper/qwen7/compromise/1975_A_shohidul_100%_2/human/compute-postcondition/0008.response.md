Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (as specified in the loop `range(1, n)`).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 1, so the loop will start executing if `1 < n`, which simplifies to `n > 1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is set to 1, we don't need to adjust its state.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables mentioned in the problem**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0, but this is not directly related to the loop execution and can remain unchanged.
   - `a` is a list of integers, and `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether each element in `a` is not greater than or equal to the previous one starting from index 1. These variables are not part of the loop head and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
