Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether not all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether not all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `i`, `n`, `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`, it will always print the same string regardless of these variables' states.

Output: **NO**
