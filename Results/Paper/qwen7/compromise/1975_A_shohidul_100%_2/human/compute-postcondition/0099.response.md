Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly given a starting value in the loop head, but it starts from 1 according to the `range(1, n)` function.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is 1 initially (since the loop starts from 1).
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 (since `i` starts at 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < n`).

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - The other variables (`t`, `new`, `check_all_new`, `new_all`, `a`, and `check_all`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
