Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `check_all_new` is True, `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index `i` to the end and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered by the `break` statement, the initial conditions remain unchanged.
