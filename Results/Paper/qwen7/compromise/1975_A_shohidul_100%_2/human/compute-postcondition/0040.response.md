Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value based on the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value based on the condition `[(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]`.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `new` is a slice from index `n` to the end of `a`.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
