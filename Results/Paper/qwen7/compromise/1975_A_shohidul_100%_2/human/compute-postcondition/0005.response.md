Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The check_all is a boolean indicating whether each element in `a` is greater than or equal to the previous one starting from index 1, and the current value of `check_all` is True.**
