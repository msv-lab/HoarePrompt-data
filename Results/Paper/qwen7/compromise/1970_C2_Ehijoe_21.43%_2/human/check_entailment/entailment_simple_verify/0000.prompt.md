You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the medium version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on trees.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with a stone on
exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists of picking
an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there
(thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after which he
alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player that
cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who wins
each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to calculate the distances from the starting node to all other nodes, but it does not actually simulate the game or determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy. Instead, it simply calculates distances, which is not sufficient to determine the winner of the game.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the game rounds and determine the winner based on the optimal moves for both players. The current implementation does not account for the alternating moves between Ron and Hermione and does not consider the game's outcome based on the optimal strategy for each player.

For example, consider a simple tree with 5 nodes and a single round starting at node 1:

```
1 -- 2
|    |
3 -- 4 -- 5
```

If the starting node is 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, and then Hermione can move it to node 4. From node 4, Ron can move it to node 5, and Hermione cannot make a move from there. Therefore, Hermione loses. However, the current program does not simulate these moves and simply calculates distances, which does not reflect the game's logic.
