Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to calculate the distances from the starting node to all other nodes, but it does not actually simulate the game or determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy. Instead, it simply calculates distances, which is not sufficient to determine the winner of the game.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the game rounds and determine the winner based on the optimal moves for both players. The current implementation does not account for the alternating moves between Ron and Hermione and does not consider the game's outcome based on the optimal strategy for each player.

For example, consider a simple tree with 5 nodes and a single round starting at node 1:

```
1 -- 2
|    |
3 -- 4 -- 5
```

If the starting node is 1, Ron can move the stone to node 2, and then Hermione can move it to node 4. From node 4, Ron can move it to node 5, and Hermione cannot make a move from there. Therefore, Hermione loses. However, the current program does not simulate these moves and simply calculates distances, which does not reflect the game's logic.
