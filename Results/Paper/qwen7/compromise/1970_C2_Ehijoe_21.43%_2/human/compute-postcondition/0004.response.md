Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`. Therefore, the variables that need to be considered are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n - 1):` will execute as long as `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 1. This means `n` must be at least 2.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration. In the first iteration, `i` should be 0.

3. **Check the Given States**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `t` is 1 (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `edges` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\) (not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `empty` is True (not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list (not relevant to the loop execution).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop requires `n - 1` to be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2.
   - In the first iteration, `i` should be 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0**
