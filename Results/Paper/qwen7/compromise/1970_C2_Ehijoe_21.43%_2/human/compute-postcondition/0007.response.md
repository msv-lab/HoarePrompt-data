Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, with each key in the range [1, n] having a value that is a list containing its adjacent keys from the input, and `leaves` is a deque().**

The code initializes an empty deque named `leaves`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
