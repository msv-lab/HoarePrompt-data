Based on the initial state provided:

- `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`.
- `t` is 1.
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `start` is an input integer.
- `empty` is True.
- `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, with each key in the range [1, n] having a value that is a list containing its adjacent keys from the input.
- `leaves` is a deque containing all the keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have only one adjacent key.
- There exists at least one move in `moves` such that the move is odd.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Ron')
```

This statement will print the string 'Ron' directly, regardless of the other variables and their states.

Output: **Ron**
