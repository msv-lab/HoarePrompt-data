Output State: `b` is greater than or equal to the maximum value of `b` after 3 iterations (which is 4), `n` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 4, `m` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 4, `ans` is the sum of the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to the final value of `b`.

To break it down further:
- The loop runs as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.
- After 3 iterations, `b` is 4, so the loop will continue until `b` exceeds `min(n, m)`.
- For each iteration, `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` where `b` starts from 2 and increments by 1.
- Therefore, `ans` will be the sum of `(n + 2) // 4`, `(n + 3) // 9`, `(n + 4) // 16`, and so on, up to the last valid `b` which is `min(n, m)`.

This means `ans` will contain the cumulative sum of these expressions for all valid `b` values from 2 up to the largest `b` where `b <= min(n, m)`.
