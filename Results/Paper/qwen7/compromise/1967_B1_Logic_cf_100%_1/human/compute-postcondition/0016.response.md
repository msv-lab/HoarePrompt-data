Output State: **`T` is `T + 1`, `t` must be greater than `T + 1`, `n` is converted to an integer from the first string in the list, `m` is converted to an integer from the second string in the list**.

Explanation: The code snippet converts the elements of the list `[n, m]` from strings to integers. The values of `T` and `t` remain unchanged according to the initial state. The list `[n, m]` is updated such that `n` and `m` are now integers derived from the corresponding strings in the original list.
