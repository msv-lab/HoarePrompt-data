Output State: **`ans` is the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` in the range from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, inclusive, and `b` equals the minimum of `n` and `m`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will contain the cumulative sum of the expressions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` starting from 2 up to the smallest value between `n` and `m`. The loop continues incrementing `b` until it reaches the minimum of `n` and `m`.
