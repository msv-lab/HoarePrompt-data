Output State: **`b` is 4, `n` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 4, `m` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 4, `ans` is `ans + (n + 7) // 16`**

Explanation: The value of `b` remains 4. The value of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified in the code. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given that `b` is 4, the expression simplifies to `(n + 4) // 16`. Since `n` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 4, the value of `ans` is now `ans + (n + 7) // 16`.
