### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program and suggested a corrected approach. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Summary Recap**:
   - The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for all \( b \) in the range from 2 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \), and prints the result. This summary is incorrect because it does not reflect the actual problem requirements.

3. **Original Program Analysis**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n`, which is incorrect.
   - The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, but it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is not relevant to the problem.

4. **Corrected Program**:
   - The corrected program iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This ensures that the program correctly counts the valid pairs.

Given the analysis, the original program is indeed incorrect because it does not properly implement the required logic. The corrected program provided in the response is the right approach.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect.
