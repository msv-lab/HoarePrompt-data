You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` in the range from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, inclusive, and `b` equals the minimum of `n` and `m`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program is as follows:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`. This initialization seems incorrect because it doesn't account for the condition involving `b`.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of `b`**:
   - The loop iterates from `2` to `min(n, m)`.
   - For each `b`, it adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the value of `ans` after processing all values of `b`.

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Initialization**:
   - The variable `ans` should be initialized to `0` instead of `n` because we need to count valid pairs, not just the initial value of `n`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not correctly implemented in the loop. The current implementation does not check this condition at all.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly represent the number of valid pairs for the given condition.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the required logic to count valid pairs. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
