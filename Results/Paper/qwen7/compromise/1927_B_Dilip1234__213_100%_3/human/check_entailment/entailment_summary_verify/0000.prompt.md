You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

    11
    
    0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4
    
    10
    
    0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
    
    1

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    
    8
    
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Output

    abracadabra
    codeforces
    a
    aaaaaaaa
    dijkstra

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
    return s



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`. It returns a string consisting of repeated sequences of the alphabet, where each character in the alphabet appears a number of times specified by the corresponding integer in the list `a`. If the integer in `a` is `0`, the corresponding character in the alphabet is not included in the output string. The function also includes the first three characters of the list `a` converted to their corresponding ASCII characters at the end of the string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate a string based on the given trace. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  6
  0 1 1 2 2 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  A string like `aaabb` would be correct, but the program generates a string using the first available character that matches the count, which may not produce the correct sequence of characters.

- Actual Output:
  The program will generate a string using the first available character that matches the count, which might not respect the order of character appearances as required by the trace.

For example, for the trace `[0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, the program might generate a string like `abcde` instead of `aaabb`, which does not satisfy the condition that the number of indices `j` (where `j < i` and `s_i = s_j`) matches the trace values.

Thus, the program does not handle the generation of the string correctly for all potential cases.
