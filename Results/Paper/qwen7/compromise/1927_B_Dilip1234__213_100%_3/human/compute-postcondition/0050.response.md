Output State: **`i` is 26, `j` is 25, `n` is 26, `s` is 'bab...zAbbCdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzaaaabbbbccccdddd....zzzzb', `char_count[2]` is 27, `char_count[3] is 30**.

The value of `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is 25, `char_count[25]` is increased by 1. Initially, `char_count[25]` is 29, so after the increment, it becomes 30. All other variables remain unchanged.
