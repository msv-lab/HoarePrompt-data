Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(26)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 26.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is 3
   - `n` is 26 (this value does not change within the loop)
   - `s` is 'bab...zAb' (this string does not change within the loop)
   - `char_count[3]` is 28 (this value does not change within the loop)

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 4.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 0.
   - `j` is updated to 4.
   - `n` remains unchanged at 26.
   - `s` remains unchanged at 'bab...zAb'.
   - `char_count[3]` remains unchanged at 28.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 4, `n` is 26, `s` is 'bab...zAb', `char_count[3]` is 28**.
