Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 3; `n` is a positive integer; `s` is 'bab'; `char_count[2]` is equal to 3**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `char_count[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 3, `char_count[3]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `char_count[2]` was equal to 2. Since `j` is 3, which is not the same index as 2, the value of `char_count[2]` remains unchanged. Therefore, `char_count[3]` is now equal to 1 (initially 0) plus 1, making it 1. However, since the question specifies that `char_count[2]` is equal to 2, it implies that `char_count` is an array or list where the value at index 2 is specifically mentioned, and the increment happens at index 3. Thus, `char_count[2]` remains 2, and `char_count[3]` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
