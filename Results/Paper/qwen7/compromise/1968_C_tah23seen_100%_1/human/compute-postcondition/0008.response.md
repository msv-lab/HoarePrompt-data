To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions:

1. The loop condition is `i >= 0`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is decreased by 1.

Given this information, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0 after the decrement operation.

Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_prev`. After decrementing `i_prev` by 1, the new value of `i` (let's call it `i_new`) should satisfy the loop condition `i_new >= 0`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `i_prev - 1 >= 0`, which simplifies to `i_prev >= 1`.

Since the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`, and we know that `i` was decremented by 1 from its previous value, we need to ensure that `i` is still non-negative.

State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except for `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for all 0 <= i < n-1; `i` must be greater than or equal to 0**
