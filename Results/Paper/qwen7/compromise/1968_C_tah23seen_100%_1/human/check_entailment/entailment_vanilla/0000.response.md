Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling and Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` containing `n-1` integers.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The program calls the function `func_1(arr, n)` to generate the array `ans`.
   - It then prints the elements of `ans`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes an array `ans` with all elements set to \(10^9\).
   - It starts from the second last element of `ans` and works backwards to the first element.
   - For each position `i`, it sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.

### Checking the Logic

Given the problem constraints:
- \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
- \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\)

Let's verify if the logic in `func_1` meets these requirements:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Setting all elements of `ans` to \(10^9\) ensures that they are within the valid range.

2. **Backward Iteration:**
   - For each `i` starting from \(n-2\) down to 0, the value of `ans[i]` is set to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.
   - This means:
     \[
     a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i
     \]
   - Since \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\), we need to ensure that the chosen \(a_i\) values satisfy this condition.

### Example Verification

Let's take the first example provided:
- Test case: \(n = 4\), \(arr = [2, 4, 1]\)

Using the function:
- Initialize `ans` as `[1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`
- Set \(a_3 = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999\)
- Set \(a_2 = 999999999 - 4 = 999999995\)
- Set \(a_1 = 999999995 - 2 = 999999993\)

This gives us \(a = [999999993, 999999995, 999999999, 999999999]\).

Checking the conditions:
- \(999999993 \bmod 999999995 = 999999993 \bmod 999999995 = 2\)
- \(999999995 \bmod 999999999 = 999999995 \bmod 999999999 = 4\)
- \(999999999 \bmod 999999999 = 999999999 \bmod 999999999 = 1\)

These values satisfy the conditions, but the solution can be simplified to smaller values.

### Simplified Solution

A simpler and more efficient approach would be to use the smallest possible values that satisfy the conditions. For example, starting from \(a_{n-1} = x_{n-1}\) and working backwards.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the smallest possible values for \(a_i\). Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
