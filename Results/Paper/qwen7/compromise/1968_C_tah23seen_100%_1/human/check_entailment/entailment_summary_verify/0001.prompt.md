You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first `n-1` elements are calculated using the formula `ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-2`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` remains unchanged. All elements except the first `n-1` are set to \(10^9\), and the variable `i` is set to `-1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling and Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` containing `n-1` integers.

2. **Function Call:**
   - The program calls the function `func_1(arr, n)` to generate the array `ans`.
   - It then prints the elements of `ans`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes an array `ans` with all elements set to \(10^9\).
   - It starts from the second last element of `ans` and works backwards to the first element.
   - For each position `i`, it sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.

### Checking the Logic

Given the problem constraints:
- \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)
- \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\)

Let's verify if the logic in `func_1` meets these requirements:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Setting all elements of `ans` to \(10^9\) ensures that they are within the valid range.

2. **Backward Iteration:**
   - For each `i` starting from \(n-2\) down to 0, the value of `ans[i]` is set to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.
   - This means:
     \[
     a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i
     \]
   - Since \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\), we need to ensure that the chosen \(a_i\) values satisfy this condition.

### Example Verification

Let's take the first example provided:
- Test case: \(n = 4\), \(arr = [2, 4, 1]\)

Using the function:
- Initialize `ans` as `[1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`
- Set \(a_3 = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999\)
- Set \(a_2 = 999999999 - 4 = 999999995\)
- Set \(a_1 = 999999995 - 2 = 999999993\)

This gives us \(a = [999999993, 999999995, 999999999, 999999999]\).

Checking the conditions:
- \(999999993 \bmod 999999995 = 999999993 \bmod 999999995 = 2\)
- \(999999995 \bmod 999999999 = 999999995 \bmod 999999999 = 4\)
- \(999999999 \bmod 999999999 = 999999999 \bmod 999999999 = 1\)

These values satisfy the conditions, but the solution can be simplified to smaller values.

### Simplified Solution

A simpler and more efficient approach would be to use the smallest possible values that satisfy the conditions. For example, starting from \(a_{n-1} = x_{n-1}\) and working backwards.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the smallest possible values for \(a_i\). Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
