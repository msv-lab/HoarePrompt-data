Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing an array `a` such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).
2. The provided solution attempts to construct the array `a` by setting `a_1` to a large value (specifically \(10^9\)) and then calculating subsequent values based on the given formula \( a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i \).

However, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. Specifically:
- The function sets all elements of `ans` to \(10^9\) initially.
- It then iterates backward through the array, updating each element based on the previous element and the corresponding `x_i` value.
- This approach does not guarantee that the constructed `a` will satisfy the modulo condition for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).

To illustrate the flaw, consider the following example:
- Input: `arr = [2, 4, 1]` and `n = 4`
- Expected output: An array `a` such that \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2 \), \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4 \), and \( a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1 \).

Using the provided function:
- `ans = [10^9, 10^9, 10^9, 10^9]`
- After the loop:
  - `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 10^9 - 2 = 999999998`
  - `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 10^9 - 4 = 999999996`
  - `ans[2] = ans[3] - arr[2] = 10^9 - 1 = 999999999`
  - `ans[3] = 10^9`

Clearly, these values do not satisfy the required modulo conditions.

A correct approach would involve starting from the smallest possible value for `a_1` and incrementally constructing the array to ensure the modulo conditions are met. However, the provided solution does not achieve this.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
