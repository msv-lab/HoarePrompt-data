Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and its length is not specified in the initial state, `n` will be an integer representing the length of `s`. All other information about `s` remains unchanged.
