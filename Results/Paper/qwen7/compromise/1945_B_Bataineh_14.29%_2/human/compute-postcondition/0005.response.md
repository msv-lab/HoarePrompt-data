Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, and calculates either `2` or the value of `m // a + m // b + 2` based on whether `m` is less than both `a` and `b`. It then prints the result for each test case. The function does not return any value but produces a series of outputs corresponding to each test case.**
