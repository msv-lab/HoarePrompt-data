### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program Analysis:
The provided program does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a heuristic approach involving the variable `x` and some arithmetic operations. This heuristic approach is not clearly explained in the provided code, making it difficult to understand why it works.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that the program calculates a cumulative sum based on a specific formula involving `a` and `i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `b`). If certain conditions are met, 1 is added to `suma`. Finally, it prints the result of `suma - 2`.

Given the example provided in the problem statement:
- For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the expected output is 14.
- For \(n = 100\) and \(m = 1233\), the expected output is 153.

The program indeed produces these outputs, suggesting that it might be correct for these specific examples. However, the original assessment points out that the logic used in the program is flawed and does not handle all cases correctly.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Heuristic Approach**: The program uses a heuristic approach that does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This makes it difficult to verify the correctness of the program without a detailed proof or a thorough understanding of the logic.
2. **Specific Examples**: While the program produces the correct outputs for the given examples, it does not guarantee that it will work correctly for all possible inputs. The original assessment correctly points out that the logic is not robust enough to handle all cases.
3. **Correctness**: The original assessment is accurate because the program's logic is not proven to be correct for all possible inputs. The heuristic approach might work for some cases but fails for others.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program's logic is not robust enough to handle all possible inputs correctly.

**Final: False**
