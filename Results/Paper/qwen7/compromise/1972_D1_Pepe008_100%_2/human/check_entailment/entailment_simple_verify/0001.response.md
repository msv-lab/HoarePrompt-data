### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to confirm the original assessment.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `suma` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to store the count of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of `i`**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `b` (inclusive).
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x` using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)
     \]
   - If `x` is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - It then checks if both `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0` and `i * (i - 1) % i^2 == 0` hold true. If they do, it adds 1 to `suma`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - After processing all values of `i`, it prints `suma - 2`.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Formula Analysis
The formula used in the program:
\[
x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} + 1\right)
\]
This formula does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The expression inside the formula does not accurately reflect the relationship between `a`, `b`, and their gcd.

#### Condition Check
The condition check:
\[
(a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0 \quad \text{and} \quad i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0
\]
These conditions are irrelevant to the problem. They do not help in determining whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Final Adjustment
The final adjustment `suma - 2` is unnecessary and incorrect. It should not be subtracted unless there is a specific reason related to the problem constraints, which is not evident here.

### Conclusion

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. The formula and conditions used in the program are incorrect and do not meet the problem requirements.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
