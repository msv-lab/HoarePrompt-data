Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of \( i \) from 1 to \( b \).
2. For each \( i \), it calculates \( x \) using the formula \( x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \).
3. If \( x \) is greater than 0, it adds \( x \) to `suma`.
4. Additionally, if both \( (a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0 \) and \( i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0 \) are true, it adds 1 to `suma`.

However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of \( x \) and the condition checking are not aligned with the problem statement. The problem requires that \( a + b \) should be a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). The current implementation does not correctly check this condition.

To verify correctness, we need to compare the logic of the given program with the intended solution. The given solution does not correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

Correctness: **False**
