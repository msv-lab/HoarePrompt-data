You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^6.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 9999, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is the maximum value of `b` passed into the loop, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, and `suma` is the cumulative sum of all `x` values that satisfy the conditions `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` throughout the loop's iterations.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to the total number of inputs processed, which is 9999 given the constraint `1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4`. The variable `a` retains its initial value as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `b` will be set to the highest value it reached during the loop's execution, and `i` will be one more than the final value of `b`. The variable `x` is calculated based on the last iteration's values, and `suma` accumulates the value of `x` for each iteration of the loop, adding 1 to `suma` if the specific condition is met for any `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m, with constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6 and the total sum of n and m across all test cases not exceeding 2 * 10^6. For each test case, it returns either "valid" if both n and m satisfy the given conditions, or "invalid" if any condition is not met.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
