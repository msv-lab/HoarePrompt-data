Output State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `int(info[1]) + 2`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, and `suma` is incremented by 1 if the condition \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\) is true.**

Explanation: The given code updates the value of `x` based on the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\). Here, `a` is `int(info[0])`, and `i` is `int(info[1]) + 2`. The value of `t`, `b`, and `suma` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for incrementing `suma` by 1 depends on whether \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\) is true, but since the truth value of this condition is not specified, we keep it as a conditional statement.
