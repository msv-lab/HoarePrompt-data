Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`**.

This means that the value of `T` remains unchanged, `t` is still 0, `a` is now the integer value of the first element in the list `info`, and `b` is the integer value of the second element in the list `info`.
