Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `i` is `k + 1`, `x` is `(a - (k + 1) * k) // (k + 1) ** 2 + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is calculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, we substitute `i` with `k + 1` in the formula. Therefore, `x` becomes `(a - (k + 1) * k) // (k + 1) ** 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
