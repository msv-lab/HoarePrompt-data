Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `i` is `k + 1`, `x` is `(a - (k + 1) * k) // (k + 1)`, `suma` is `suma + x`**.

In this output state, the variable `suma` has been updated by adding the value of `x` to its current value. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions from the initial state.
