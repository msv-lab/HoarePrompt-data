Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is int(info[0]), `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is equal to `suma` + 1 + x, `x` is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i**.

Explanation: The code `suma += 1` increments the value of `suma` by 1. Since `suma` was previously equal to `suma` + x, after this operation, `suma` is now equal to `suma` + 1 + x. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
