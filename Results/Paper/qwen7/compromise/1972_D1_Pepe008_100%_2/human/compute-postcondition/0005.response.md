Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, b + 1):` will start with `i` set to 1 and increment `i` until `i` is greater than `b`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must start from 1 and `b` must be a positive integer.

3. **Initial Values of Given Variables**:
   - `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\).
   - `t` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `a` is `int(info[0])` (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `b` is `int(info[1])` (relevant to the loop head).
   - `suma` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head).

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `b` must be a positive integer. Given that `b` is derived from `info[1]`, we need to ensure that `b` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `b` must be at least 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is 0**
