Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is int(info[0]), `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is either x + 1 or remains suma, `x` is (a - (i_end + 1) * ((i_end + 1) - 1)) // (i_end + 1), and the current value of x satisfies ((a - (i_end + 1) * ((i_end + 1) - 1)) % (i_end + 1); `x` is updated to (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `x` is now calculated using this new formula. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously determined states.
