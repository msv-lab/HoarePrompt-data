Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the value `b + 1` as the upper limit of the range.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1, as specified in the range function `range(1, b + 1)`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the upper limit `b + 1` must be greater than the initial value of `i`, which is 1. Therefore, `b` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **List of Variables to Adjust**: The variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `b`.

Given this analysis, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 1 (which is already given) and `b` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Here is the final state that needs to be adjusted:

**State: **`t` is 1, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `suma` is 0, `info` is a list of strings split from the input, `b` must be at least 1**
