Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is int(info[0]), `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is equal to `suma` + x, `x` is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i.**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` updates the value of `suma` by adding the current value of `x` to it. The value of `x` is defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. Since the initial state of `x` is given as `(a - (i_end + 1) * ((i_end + 1) - 1)) // (i_end + 1)`, and assuming `i` is updated to `i_end + 1`, the value of `x` remains the same as it was initially calculated. Therefore, `suma` is updated to its previous value plus the current value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously described states.
