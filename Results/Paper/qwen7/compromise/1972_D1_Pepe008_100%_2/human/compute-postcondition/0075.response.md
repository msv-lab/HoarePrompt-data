Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(1, b + 1)`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, b + 1):` will execute as long as `b + 1 > 1`.
   - This means `b` must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `b` is at least 1.
   - The value of `i` is set to `int(info[1]) + 1` outside the loop, so we don't need to adjust `i` since it is already defined correctly based on the initial values.
   - The other variables (`t`, `a`, `x`, `suma`, and `info`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and can remain as they are unless explicitly required by the loop body (which is omitted).

4. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - Ensure `b` is at least 1.
   - Keep the other variables as they are.

Therefore, the state adjustment needed is:

**State: **`t` is 2, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is at least 1, `i` is `int(info[1]) + 1`, `x` is undefined, `suma` is 0, `info` is updated with the new input split into a list**.
