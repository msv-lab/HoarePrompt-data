You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three values: the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, two integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, it calculates and prints the length of a list `nums` which contains the first 24 powers of 2 (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)) and additional elements based on the value of \(k\). Specifically, it removes one element from this list and appends three new elements. The printed output includes the length of `nums` followed by the elements in `nums`. The final state of `nums` varies for each test case based on the value of \(k\), but it always includes the first 24 powers of 2 and some additional elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a sequence `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, consider the test case where `n = 10` and `k = 7`. According to the problem description, the sequence should:

1. Not have any subsequence with a sum of `k = 7`.
2. Have subsequences with sums of all values from `1` to `n` except `k`.

However, the generated sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]` includes a subsequence that sums to `7` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4]`). This violates the first condition.

To meet both conditions, the sequence should avoid including numbers that can form the sum `k` through any combination of its elements. The current approach does not guarantee this, as demonstrated by the counterexample. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
