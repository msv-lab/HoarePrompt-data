Output State: **`idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) excluding \(2^{24}\) and now also contains `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the previous values of `n` and `k`. All other variables (`idx`, `t`, `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
