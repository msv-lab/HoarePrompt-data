Output State: `idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 << idx\). Given that the loop executed 3 times, it means `k` was at least \(2^3 = 8\) initially. Each iteration doubles the value that `k` must meet, so after 24 iterations (`idx` reaching 24), `k` must be at least \(2^{24} = 16777216\).
