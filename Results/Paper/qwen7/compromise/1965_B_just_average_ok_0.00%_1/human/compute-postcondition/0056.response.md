Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `idx` is 23.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an input integer (though its specific value isn't needed for this calculation).
   - `k` must be at least 16777216.
   - `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). This means `nums` initially contains the numbers from 1 to 8388608 (since \(2^{23} = 8388608\)), and `nums[23]` is specifically `k - 2^{23}`.
   - `nums` now contains an additional element which is `k + 1`.
   - `nums` is updated to exclude `1 << idx` (which is \(2^{23}\)). Since `idx` is 23, `1 << idx` is \(2^{23} = 8388608\).

2. **Updated List `nums`:**
   - Initially, `nums` had 24 elements (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)).
   - After adding `k + 1`, `nums` had 25 elements.
   - Excluding `1 << idx` (which is 8388608), the list `nums` now has one less element.

3. **Length of `nums`:**
   - Initially, `nums` had 25 elements.
   - After excluding `8388608`, `nums` has 24 elements.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(len(nums))`.
   - `len(nums)` returns the number of elements in the list `nums`.

Therefore, the length of `nums` after the operations is 24.

Output: **24**
