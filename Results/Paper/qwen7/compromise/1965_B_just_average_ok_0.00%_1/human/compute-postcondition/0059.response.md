Output State: The loop will execute for each test case provided by the user. For each test case, `idx` will be set to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. After processing all test cases, `nums` will contain the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) (i.e., the powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\)), along with any additional elements added during the loop execution based on the value of `k` for each test case. Each `nums` list will have its specific `1 << idx` value removed. The final state of `nums` after all iterations will be a combination of these lists, with each list potentially having different additional elements based on the `k` values for each test case. The length of `nums` for each test case will vary depending on the value of `k`, but the overall structure of `nums` will consist of the powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) and any additional elements specified by the loop.

Since the exact values of `k` for each test case are not specified, we cannot determine the exact contents of `nums` after all iterations. However, we know that `nums` will always include the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and may include additional elements based on the `k` values for each test case. The length of `nums` for each test case will be determined by the value of `k` and the operations performed within the loop.
