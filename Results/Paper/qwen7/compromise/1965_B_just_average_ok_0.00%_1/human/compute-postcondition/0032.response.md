Output State: **`idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `current_iterations + 1`, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and `k + nums[idx] + 1` is in the list `nums`.**

Explanation: Initially, `idx` was 25. The code snippet `idx -= 1` decrements `idx` by 1. Therefore, `idx` is now 24. All other variables remain unchanged.
