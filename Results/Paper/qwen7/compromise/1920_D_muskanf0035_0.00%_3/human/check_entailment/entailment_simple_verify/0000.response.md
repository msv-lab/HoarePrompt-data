### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
    
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

1. **Initialization**: `array` and `result` are initialized as empty lists.
2. **Loop through operations**:
   - If `op_type` is 1, append `value` to `array`.
   - If `op_type` is 2, extend `array` with `x` copies of its current content. However, the annotation states that the loop only extends the array with one copy of itself, which is incorrect. The actual implementation should extend the array with `x` copies.
3. **Query handling**: For each query `k`, append the `(k-1) % len(array)`-th element of `array` to `result`.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):

```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)
```

1. **Input processing**: Read the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, read `n` operations and `q` queries.
2. **Processing each test case**: Call `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and print the results.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

The annotation correctly identifies that the loop in `func_1` only extends the array with one copy of itself, rather than `x` copies. This is indeed a mistake. Let's correct the loop to properly handle the operation of type 2:

```python
for (op_type, value) in operations:
    if op_type == 1:
        array.append(value)
    else:
        array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))] * value)
```

With this correction, the array will be extended with `x` copies of its current content when `op_type` is 2.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))] * value)
    
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate because the provided program does not correctly handle the operations described in the problem. The corrected version of the program ensures that the array is extended with `x` copies of its current content when `op_type` is 2, which aligns with the problem statement.

**Final: True**
