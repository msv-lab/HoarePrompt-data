### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and the logic behind it.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as parameters.
   - It initializes an empty `array` and an empty `result`.
   - The loop processes each operation:
     - If the operation type (`op_type`) is 1, it appends the value to `array`.
     - If the operation type is 2, it extends `array` by appending `value` copies of itself.
   - After processing all operations, it iterates through `queries` and appends the `(k-1) % len(array)`-th element of `array` to `result`.
   - Finally, it returns `result`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, then reads the operations and queries.
   - It calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The issue with `func_1` lies in how it processes the operations. Specifically, when `op_type` is 2, it should extend the array by appending `value` copies of the current array, but it incorrectly appends the same elements repeatedly without updating the array correctly.
- The correct approach would be to keep track of the current size of the array and update it accordingly after each operation.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            # Extend the array by appending 'value' copies of the current array
            array.extend(array * value)
    
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    
    return result
```

### Conclusion:
The original implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it does not properly handle the extension of the array when `op_type` is 2. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
