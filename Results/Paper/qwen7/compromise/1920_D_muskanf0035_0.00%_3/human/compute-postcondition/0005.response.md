State: **`array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list, `queries` is a non-empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `k`, which iterates over the `queries` list.
2. **Determine the initial state of `array` and `result`**: Both `array` and `result` are initially empty lists.
3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in `queries`. However, the problem statement mentions that the loop body does not modify the `result` list and only operates on the `array` list by extending it with its own contents, which means the length of `array` doubles in each iteration but remains empty because it starts as an empty list and no new elements are added.
4. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `queries` must contain at least one element. If `queries` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute, which means `queries` must have at least one element. The states of `array` and `result` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop.
