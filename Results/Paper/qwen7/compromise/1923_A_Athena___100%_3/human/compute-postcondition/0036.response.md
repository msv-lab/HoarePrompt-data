The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is empty, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` remains an input integer, and `res` is equal to the total number of zeros in the original list `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, it means `t` can be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, `t` should be adjusted to `t - 1`.

State: **`a` is empty, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive (decremented by 1), `n` remains an input integer, `res` is equal to the total number of zeros in the original list `a`**
