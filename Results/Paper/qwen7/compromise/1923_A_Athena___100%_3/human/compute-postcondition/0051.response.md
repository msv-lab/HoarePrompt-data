Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is: `a` contains all elements except the last one, and the last element of `a` is no longer zero.
- The loop condition is: `while a and a[-1] == 0:`

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `a` is not empty (`a`) and the last element of `a` is zero (`a[-1] == 0`).
2. **Current State**: 
   - `a` contains all elements except the last one.
   - The last element of `a` is no longer zero.

### Required Adjustments
- For the loop to continue, `a` must not be empty and the last element of `a` must be zero.
- Since `a` is not empty (it contains all elements except the last one), the only thing that needs adjustment is the last element of `a` to be zero.

### Conclusion
To allow the loop to execute one more time, the last element of `a` needs to be set to zero.

### Final State
State: **`a` contains all elements except the last one, and the last element of `a` is zero**
