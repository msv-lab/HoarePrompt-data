Output State: **`t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `i` is `i + 2`, `res` is `res + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. The other variables (`t`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `res` was `res + 1` if `a[i]` is 0, otherwise `res` remains 0. After executing `res += 1`, `res` is now `res + 1` regardless of the condition.
