You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1. Additionally, in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be reduced by 6 times the sum of all `n` values entered initially. The list `a` will be empty after all leading and trailing zeros have been removed from each `a` list during each iteration. The variable `res` will be the total count of all zeros present in all the lists `a` across all iterations.
    #
    #This means that `t` will reflect the remaining number of iterations after accounting for all the iterations performed based on the input values of `n`. The `res` variable will hold the cumulative count of zeros from all the processed lists `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers (each either 0 or 1). The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for each test case, indicating if at least one cell contains a chip.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
