Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of regular polygons by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3, which is incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility of forming multiple polygons with different side lengths.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all stick lengths to determine the largest possible side length for the polygons, and then calculate how many polygons can be formed with that side length without exceeding the total number of sticks.
