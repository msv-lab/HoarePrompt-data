You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, m, and k such that 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on the conditions given in the loop. Specifically, for each test case, if \( n \leq k \) or \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil < k \), 'NO' will be printed; otherwise, 'YES' will be printed. The number of lines with 'YES' or 'NO' will correspond to the value of \( t \).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a set of three positive integers (n, m, k) where 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and returns a value based on these integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
