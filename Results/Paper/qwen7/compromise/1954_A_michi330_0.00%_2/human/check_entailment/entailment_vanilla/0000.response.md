### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice can paint each part of the ribbon with one of `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to any color.
   - Alice wants to paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Key Conditions for "NO":**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color.
   - If `n - ceil(n/m) < k`, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make them the same color. Here, `ceil(n/m)` represents the minimum number of parts that must be painted the same color to ensure that the remaining parts are less than `k`.

3. **Key Conditions for "YES":**
   - If neither of the above conditions hold, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n/m) < k`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge cases where `n <= k` and `n - math.ceil(n/m) < k` correctly.
   - It also covers the scenario where Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in the code matches the problem statement.
   - The conditions for determining whether Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color are correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
