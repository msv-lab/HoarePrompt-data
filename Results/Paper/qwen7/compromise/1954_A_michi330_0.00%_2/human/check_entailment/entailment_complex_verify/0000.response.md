### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the given test cases to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

#### Test Case Analysis:
1. **Case 1: `1 1 1`**
   - `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
   - `n <= k` is true, so the program prints 'NO'.
   - Correct output: 'NO'

2. **Case 2: `5 1 1`**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`
   - `math.ceil(n / m) = 5`, so `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 0 < k` is false.
   - `n <= k` is false, so the program prints 'NO'.
   - Correct output: 'NO'

3. **Case 3: `5 2 1`**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`
   - `math.ceil(n / m) = 3`, so `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 2 < k` is true.
   - The program prints 'NO'.
   - Correct output: 'NO' (The original assessment is incorrect here)

4. **Case 4: `5 2 2`**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
   - `math.ceil(n / m) = 3`, so `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 2 < k` is true.
   - The program prints 'NO'.
   - Correct output: 'NO' (The original assessment is incorrect here)

5. **Case 5: `5 5 3`**
   - `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`
   - `n <= k` is true, so the program prints 'NO'.
   - Correct output: 'NO'

From the above analysis, we see that the program's logic is correct for the cases where `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. However, the original assessment incorrectly identified these cases as incorrect.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program correctly handles the cases where `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. The program does not need additional checks for `m <= k` because the given conditions already cover all necessary scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is correct according to the problem statement and the given test cases.
