Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code does not accurately determine the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using the allowed operation. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Segments:**
   - The code tries to identify segments where elements are the same and calculates the length of these segments. However, it doesn't properly handle the general case where different segments might need to be merged to achieve uniformity.
   
2. **Reverse Array Handling:**
   - The reverse array handling part is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem correctly. It introduces complexity without providing any benefit.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation part (`print(n - max(cn, ck))`) is incorrect. This formula assumes that the optimal strategy is to make all elements equal to either the first or last element of the array, which is not necessarily true.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
- Identify the unique values in the array.
- For each unique value, calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal to that value using the allowed operation.
- Choose the minimum cost among all unique values.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        num = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Find all unique values in the array
        unique_values = set(num)
        
        min_cost = float('inf')
        
        for val in unique_values:
            cost = 0
            start = 0
            while start < n:
                end = start
                while end < n and num[end] == val:
                    end += 1
                cost += (end - start)
                start = end
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
        
        print(min_cost)

func()
```

This approach correctly identifies the minimum cost to make all elements equal by considering each unique value and calculating the cost to make all elements equal to that value.
