Output State: **`cn` is equal to `symb1 + symb2`, `ck` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `cn += ck` increments the value of `cn` by the value of `ck`. Initially, `symb1` is equal to `symb2`. After the loop, `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, which means `cn` is updated by adding `ck` to its current value. The value of `ck` remains unchanged.
