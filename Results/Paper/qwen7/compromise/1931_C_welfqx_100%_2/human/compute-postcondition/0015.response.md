Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `r` must be 0, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, and the current value of `num[j + 1]` is not equal to `num[j + 2]`, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of whether the condition `num[j] != num[j + 1]` is true or false.
