State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `r` must be 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `r` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
- The loop condition `range(t)` means that the loop will run `t` times.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
- Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0.
- Additionally, `r` must be set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

These adjustments ensure that the loop can start executing as intended.
