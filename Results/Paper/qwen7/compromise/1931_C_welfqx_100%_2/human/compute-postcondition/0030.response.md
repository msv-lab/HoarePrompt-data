Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `r` is 0, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `j` equals `n-1`, `onum` is the reversed version of `num`.**

Explanation: The code `onum.reverse()` reverses the list `onum`. Since `onum` is a copy of `num`, reversing `onum` changes its content but does not affect the other variables. The initial conditions for `t`, `r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, and `onum` remain unchanged except that `onum` is now the reversed version of the original `num`.
