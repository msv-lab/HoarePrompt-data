Output State: **`j` is `n - 1` and `f` is 0; `onum` is a copy of `num`.**

Explanation: The code `onum = num.copy()` creates a copy of the variable `num` and assigns it to `onum`. The values of `j` and `f` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `j` is still `n - 1` and `f` is still 0. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop as per the given postcondition.
