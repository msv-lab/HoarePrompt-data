Let's break down the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - After the loop executes all the iterations, `ii` will be `n-2`.
   - `ck` will be the count of consecutive pairs of elements in `onum` that are the same.
   - `cn` will be incremented by `ck`.
   - The value of `n` will remain unchanged.
   - Other variables (`r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`) will retain their values from the initial state or as described in the postconditions after 3 iterations.
   - Within the if condition, `symb1` is equal to `symb2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(n - max(cn, ck))
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `cn` is incremented by `ck`.
- `ck` is the count of consecutive pairs of elements in `onum` that are the same.

Given these points, let's determine the values for `cn` and `ck`:
- Since `cn` is incremented by `ck`, `cn` will be at least `ck`.
- The exact values of `cn` and `ck` depend on the specific values in `onum` and how many consecutive pairs are found during the loop iterations.

However, the print statement will evaluate `n - max(cn, ck)`. Given that `cn` is at least `ck`, `max(cn, ck)` will be `cn`.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
```python
print(n - cn)
```

Since `n` remains unchanged and `cn` is the count of consecutive pairs of elements in `onum` that are the same, the exact value of `cn` is not specified, but it is known that `cn` is incremented by `ck`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **n - cn**
