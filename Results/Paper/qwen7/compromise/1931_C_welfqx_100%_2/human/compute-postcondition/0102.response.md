Output State: **`r` is 0, `n` is 1 or `f` is 1, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `onum` is a copy of `num`.**

Explanation: The code `onum = num.copy()` creates a copy of the list `num` and assigns it to the variable `onum`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `r` is still 0, `n` is still 1 or `f` is 1, `f` is still 0, `num` remains a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `j` is still equal to `n - 1`, and `onum` is now a copy of `num`.
