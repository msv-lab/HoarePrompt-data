Output State: **`j` is `n - 1`, `f` is 1, `onum` is a reversed version of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`**.

The code assigns the first element of the list `num` to the variable `symb1`. Since `num` is a predefined variable, `symb1` now holds the value of the first element of `num`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
