Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 3, `cn` is 1**

The variable `cn` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is not relevant since it's incremented by 1). Given the initial state, `n` must be greater than 4 and `i` is 3. After executing the line `cn += 1`, `cn` becomes 1.
