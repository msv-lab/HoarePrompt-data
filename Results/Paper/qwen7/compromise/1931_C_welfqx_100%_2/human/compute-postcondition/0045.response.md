Output State: **`i` is 1; `cn` is 1**

Explanation: The code `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 1 and does not get affected by this line of code, `i` remains unchanged. Since `cn` was not initialized before this line, it is assumed to be 0 initially, and after executing `cn += 1`, its value becomes 1.
