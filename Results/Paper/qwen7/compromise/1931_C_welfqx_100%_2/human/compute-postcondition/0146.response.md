Postcondition: **`ii` is `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 2, `num` is a list or array where all elements from index 0 to `n-2` are checked for consecutive identical elements, `cn` is the total count of consecutive identical elements found during the entire loop execution, the loop has checked all elements up to the second last one, the current value of `ii` is `n - 1`, the current value of `cn` is incremented by 1 if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise `cn` remains unchanged.**
