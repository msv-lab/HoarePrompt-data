Output State: **`r` is 0, `n` is 1 or `f` is 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `num` to the variable `symb1`. Since `num` is a list of integers, `symb1` will be set to the first integer in the list. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
