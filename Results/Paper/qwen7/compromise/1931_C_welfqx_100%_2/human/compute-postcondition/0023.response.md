Output State: **Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `r` must be 0, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, and `j` equals `n-1`.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `t` remains greater than 0, `r` remains 0, `f` is set to 0, `num` retains its original list of integers, and the index `j` will be equal to `n-1`. This means that either the loop has checked all consecutive pairs in the list `num` without finding any two consecutive elements that are equal (thus `f` is 0), or it has found at least one pair of consecutive elements that are different and therefore broke out of the loop early.
