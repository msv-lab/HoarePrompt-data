Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `n` and `j`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The precondition that `n` must be at least 2 and `j` is 1 remains unchanged.
