Output State: `r` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `f` is 0, `num` is a list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and the loop has executed all iterations without finding any consecutive elements in `num` that are not equal, thus breaking the loop.
