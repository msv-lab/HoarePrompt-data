Output State: **`j` is `n - 1`, `f` is 0, `onum` is a reversed version of `num`, `cn` is 1.**

The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `cn`. Since `j` was initially `n - 1`, `f` was `0`, and `onum` was a reversed version of `num`, these values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `cn` being set to `1`.
