### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes variables `n`, `m`, and `s` correctly to store the number of problems, the number of rounds, and the difficulty levels of the existing problems, respectively.
3. **Counter Usage**: The `Counter` from the `collections` module is used to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string `s`.
4. **Calculation of Additional Problems Needed**:
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', it checks if the required number of problems (`m`) is less than the available problems in the counter.
   - If fewer problems are available than needed, it calculates the additional problems required and adds this to the total count `ans`.
5. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Verification:
- The logic correctly handles the requirement to ensure that there are at least `m` problems for each difficulty level.
- The use of `Counter` ensures that the counts are accurate and efficient.
- The program accounts for the minimum number of problems needed by considering both the current availability and the required number of problems for each difficulty level.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to hold `m` rounds.

**Correctness: True**
