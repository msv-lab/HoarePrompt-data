Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in p`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `p` that have not been processed yet. Since `i` is the next element in the sequence `p`, the loop will continue as long as `p` is not empty.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `i` is the next element in the sequence `p`, and `ans` is increased by the value of `m` if `i` is not in the dictionary `hmp`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be updated to the next element in `p`.
   - `ans` might be increased by `m` if `i` is not in `hmp`, but since we are looking at the state before the increase, `ans` remains unchanged for the next iteration.
   - `p` will lose the current `i` from its sequence, meaning `p` will now be `p` without the current `i`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `p`.
   - `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `p` will be the remaining elements of `p` after removing the current `i`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is the next element in the sequence `p`, `ans` is increased by the value of `m` if `i` is not in the dictionary `hmp`, and `p` is the sequence `p` without the current `i`**.
