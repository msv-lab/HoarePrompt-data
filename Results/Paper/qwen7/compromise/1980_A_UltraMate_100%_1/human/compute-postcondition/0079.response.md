Output State: **`i` is an integer, `hmp` is a dictionary, `ans` is increased by `m`.**

The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. Since `i` is an integer and `hmp` is a dictionary, and `i` is not a key in `hmp`, these variables remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans` is increased by `m`.
