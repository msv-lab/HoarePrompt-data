Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the sequence `p`.

3. **Analyze the postcondition**: The postcondition states that `ans` is increased by the value of `m` if and only if `i` is not in the dictionary `hmp`.

4. **Determine the state changes**:
   - `i` will take the next value from the sequence `p`.
   - `ans` might be updated based on the value of `m` and the presence of `i` in `hmp`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `i` is taken from the sequence `p`, it will be the next element in `p`.
   - `ans` will be increased by `m` if `i` is not in `hmp`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next value of `i` from `p` and the potential update to `ans`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the next element in the sequence `p`, `ans` is increased by the value of `m` if `i` is not in the dictionary `hmp`**
