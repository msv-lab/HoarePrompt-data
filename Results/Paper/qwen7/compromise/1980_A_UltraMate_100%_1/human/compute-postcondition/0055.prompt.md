Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is reduced by 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `ans` is 0, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object containing the count of each character in the string `s`
Code of the loop:
for i in p:
    if i not in hmp:
        ans += m


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', and if `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is equal to `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', and `ans` is undefined because the condition `i not in hmp` is not specified and there is no else part to provide an alternative action.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', and `ans` remains undefined because the condition `i not in hmp` is never evaluated as true (since `hmp` is not defined in the given context and thus the condition always fails).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
