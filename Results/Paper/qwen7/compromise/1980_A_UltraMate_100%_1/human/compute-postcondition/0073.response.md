Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is the sum of `2*m` and the increments made during each iteration where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `t` is decreased by 1, `s` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads an input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `n`, `m`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
