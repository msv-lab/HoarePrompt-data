Output State: **`ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`, and `hmp[i]` is an integer less than `m`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by `m - hmp[i]`. Since `hmp[i]` is an integer less than `m`, the value of `m - hmp[i]` is a positive integer. The state of `hmp[i]` remains unchanged, and the updated value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `m - hmp[i]`.
