Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 'A'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEFG'
   - If `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is equal to `m`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in p:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 'A'.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `p`, the next value of `i` will be the next character in the string `p`.
   - The string `p` is 'ABCDEFG', so the next value of `i` will be 'B'.
   - The variable `p` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - The condition `if i is not in hmp` and the assignment to `ans` depend on the value of `i` and the dictionary `hmp`, but these are not part of the loop head and thus not adjusted here.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `i` will be 'B'.
   - `p` remains 'ABCDEFG'.
   - The condition `if i is not in hmp` and the assignment to `ans` remain as they were, but since `i` changes, we need to consider the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEFG'**
