Output State: **`i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is undefined**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += m` attempts to add the value of `m` to `ans`. However, neither `ans` nor `m` are defined in the initial state, so there is no value to add. Therefore, `ans` remains undefined. The values of `i` and `p` are not affected by this line of code.
