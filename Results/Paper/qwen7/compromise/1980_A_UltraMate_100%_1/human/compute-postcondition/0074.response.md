Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `s` is the input string from the user**.

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` to 0. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `t`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `t` is mentioned as being decreased by 1, but since no specific operation is shown to modify `t`, we assume it is simply noted as being decreased without an explicit assignment.
