Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `x = 0` to `x = n-1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` and `b` are both infinity.
   - `c` is either 2 or 1.
   - `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `x` is `n`.

4. **Analyze what happens in each iteration**:
   - The loop increments `x` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each value of `x`, the loop checks if the `x`-th element of `l` is less than or equal to `b`.
   - If it is, `b` remains infinity.
   - If it is not, `a` becomes the `x`-th element of `l` and `b` remains infinity.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be `n-1` (if it was `n` before).

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `a` and `b` remain as they were because the loop condition is not met (since `x` is now `n`).
   - `c` remains as it was because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `l` remains as it was because it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `x` is now `n-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` and `b` are both infinity, `c` is either 2 or 1, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is `n-1`**.
