Output State: **`a` is set to infinity, `b` is set to infinity, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `n-1`, `c` is 0, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

The code `c = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `c`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `x`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
