Output State: **`x` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is `l[2]`, `b` remains as `l[1]` if `l[2] <= a` is true, otherwise `b` remains the original value of `a`, and `c` is 1 if `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `c` is either retained from its original value or incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the value of `l[2]` to `a` because `x` is 2. The other variables (`n`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged according to their postconditions.
