Output State: **`a` is infinity, `b` is infinity, `c` is either 0 or 1, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is `n`, `a` is now equal to `infinity`, and `b` is now equal to `infinity`.**

Explanation: The line `a, b = b, a` swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Since both `a` and `b` were initially set to infinity, after swapping, `a` remains infinity and `b` also remains infinity. The other variables (`c`, `l`, `x`) are not affected by this operation.
