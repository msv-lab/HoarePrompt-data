Postcondition: `x` is 0, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is either equal to the value of `l[0]` (if `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`) or equal to the original value of `a` (if `l[0]` is greater than `b`). Additionally, `c` is 1 if `l[0]` is greater than `b`, and `n` remains unchanged.
