Postcondition: `a` is infinity, `b` is the last element of the list `l`, `c` is either 2 or 1, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is `n-1`. If the element at index `x` in list `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` remains infinity. Otherwise, `a` becomes the element at index `x` in list `l`.
