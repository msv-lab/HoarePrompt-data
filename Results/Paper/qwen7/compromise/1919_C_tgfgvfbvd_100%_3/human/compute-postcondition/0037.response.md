Output State: **`x` is 2, `a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is equal to the original value of `a`, `c` is 1 if `l[0]` is greater than `b` and `l[1]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `c` is 2, and `n` remains unchanged if `a` is not greater than `b`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`.
- After executing `a, b = b, a`, the value of `a` becomes the original value of `b`, and the value of `b` becomes the original value of `a`.
- The value of `x` remains 2.
- The value of `c` depends on the comparison between `l[0]` and `b`, and `l[1]` and `b`, which remains unchanged.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged if `a` is not greater than `b`, which is now true since `a` and `b` are swapped and their original relationship is preserved.
