Postcondition: **`x` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is equal to either `l[1]` or the original value of `b`, `b` is equal to `l[1]` if `l[x] <= a` is true, otherwise `b` is the original value of `a`, and `c` is 1 if `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `c` is either retained from its original value or incremented by 1.**
