Output State: **`a` is infinity, `b` is infinity, `c` is either 2 or 1, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `x` is `n-1`**

The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`. Since both `a` and `b` were initially set to infinity, after swapping, both `a` and `b` remain infinity. The values of `c`, `l`, and `x` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
