Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is an input string, `list1` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `list1`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so they remain as specified in the initial state.
