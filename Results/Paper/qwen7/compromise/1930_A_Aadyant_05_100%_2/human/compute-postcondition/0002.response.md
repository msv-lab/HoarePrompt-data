Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in range(int(n))`. The variables involved here are `num` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `num` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts (since `range(int(n))` generates numbers from 0 to `int(n) - 1`).

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. This ensures that the range function generates at least one number (from 0 to `int(n) - 1`).

4. **Adjust the given states**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This value does not affect the loop's execution and can remain unchanged.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `num` is initialized to 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `num`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is 0**
