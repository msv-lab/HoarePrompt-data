Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` retains its value, `n` retains its value, `num` is `prev_num + 1`, `b` is an input string, `a` retains its value, `list1` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `b`, `final` contains the sum 0, `list2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the string `b` into a list of substrings based on whitespace and assigns this list to `list1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
