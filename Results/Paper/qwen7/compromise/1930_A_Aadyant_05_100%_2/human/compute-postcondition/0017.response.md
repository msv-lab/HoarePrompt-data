Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is sorted, `a` is an input string, `b` is a non-empty input string, `list1` is the split result of `b` and must have at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop, `str` is the current element in `list1` being processed.**

Explanation: The code `list2.sort()` sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `list2` contains the integer values of all elements in `list1` remains valid, and `list2` is now sorted.
