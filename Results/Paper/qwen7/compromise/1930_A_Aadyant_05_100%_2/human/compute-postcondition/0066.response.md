Output State: **`list1` is empty, `str` is the last string in the original list1, `list2` is a sorted list of integers representing the concatenation of all strings in `list1`.**

Explanation: The code `list2.sort()` sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. Since `list1` was emptied during the process of converting strings to integers and adding them to `list2`, `list1` is now empty. The variable `str` retains the value of the last string that was processed in `list1`. The list `list2` contains the integer representations of all strings from `list1`, sorted in ascending order.
