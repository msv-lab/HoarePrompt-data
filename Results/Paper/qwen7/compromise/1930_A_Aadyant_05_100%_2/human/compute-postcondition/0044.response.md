Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `list2`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than the length of `list2` and `i` is incremented by 2 each time.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `list2` is a sorted version of the original `list1`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `s` is the sum of the first element of `list2` plus the integer conversion of the second element of `list2`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2, the next value of `i` would be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than the length of `list2`. Therefore, `list2` must have at least 4 elements (since `i` is currently 1 and it will be incremented to 3).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `s` will be the sum of the third element of `list2` plus the integer conversion of the fourth element of `list2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`list2` is a sorted version of the original `list1`, `i` is 3, `s` is the sum of the third element of `list2` plus the integer conversion of the fourth element of `list2`**.
