Output State: **`list2` contains the integer conversion of the next element from `list1`, `str` is the next element from `list1`, and `list2` has appended the integer conversion of `str`.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer conversion of the current value of `str` to `list2`. Since `str` is the next element from `list1`, its integer conversion is added to `list2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
