Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each case consists of an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 5000) and an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 50). For each test case, it reads \( 2n \) integers and sorts them. Then, it calculates the sum of the integers at even indices for each sorted list and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum in the list.**
