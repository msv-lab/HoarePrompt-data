You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

    n = input()

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program reads inputs incorrectly and does not handle the constraints properly.

- The program reads `n` as a string and then converts it to an integer using `int(n)`, which is incorrect because `n` should be read as an integer directly.
- The program reads the next input as a string and then splits it into a list of strings, converting them to integers. However, it should read the entire list of integers at once.
- The program sorts the list but then processes it in a way that does not ensure the optimal score is achieved. It processes elements in pairs, which may not always yield the maximum score.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
1
2
1 2
```

The correct output should be `1` because the optimal strategy is to choose the smallest pair of numbers each time. However, the program would process this incorrectly and might output `2`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    final = []
    
    for _ in range(n):
        list2 = []
        for _ in range(2*n):
            list2.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        list2.sort()
        s = sum(list2[i] for i in range(0, 2*n, 2))
        final.append(s)
    
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

func()
```

This corrected version reads all inputs correctly, sorts the list, and sums the minimum elements of each pair, ensuring the maximum score is achieved.
