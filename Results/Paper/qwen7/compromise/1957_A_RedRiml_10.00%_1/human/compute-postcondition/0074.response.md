Output State: **`d` is a dictionary, `i` is `next_i`, `pl` is a list containing `next_i`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is `next_i`) to the list `pl`. The dictionary `d` is updated according to the rules given in the initial state, but since the code snippet only affects `pl`, the state of `d` and `i` remains unchanged from the initial state. The list `pl` now contains `next_i` as its first element.
