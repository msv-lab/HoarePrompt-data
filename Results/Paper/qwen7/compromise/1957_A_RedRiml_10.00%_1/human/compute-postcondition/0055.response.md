Output State: **`shapes` is 3, `j` is 3, `w` must be greater than 3, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `pl` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `pl`. None of the other variables (`shapes`, `j`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
