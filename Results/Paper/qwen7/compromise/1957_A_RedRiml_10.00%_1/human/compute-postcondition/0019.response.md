Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `palka`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `w` must be greater than 0.
   - `ln` is an input integer.
   - `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
   - `pl` is a list with at least one element containing the first element of `palka`.
   - `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is set to `1` if `d.get(i)` was `None`, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by `1`, where `i` is the first element of `palka`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - After the previous iteration, `i` has been processed from `palka`.
   - The next element `i` in `palka` will be considered in the next iteration.
   - `pl` will contain the first element of `palka` and potentially the current `i` if it is not already in `pl`.
   - `d[i]` will be updated according to the rules specified.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `palka`.
   - `pl` will be updated to include the next element of `palka` if it is not already in `pl`.
   - `d` will be updated based on the value of the next `i` in `palka`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `w` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `ln` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `palka` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `pl` will now contain the first element of `palka` and the next element of `palka` if it is not already in `pl`.
- `d` will be updated based on the next `i` in `palka`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list with at least two elements containing the first element of `palka` and the next element of `palka` if it is not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is set to 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None`, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the next element of `palka`**.
