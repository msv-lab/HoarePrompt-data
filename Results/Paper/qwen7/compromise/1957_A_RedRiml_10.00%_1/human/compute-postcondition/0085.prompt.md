Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `shapes` is 3, `j` is 3, `w` must be greater than 3, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `d` is a dictionary. If the key `i` does not exist in `d`, it is added with a value of 1. If the key `i` exists in `d` and its value is not 1, its value is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `d` is a dictionary, `i` is `next_i`. If `next_i` does not exist in `d`, it is added with a value of 2. If `next_i` exists in `d` and its value is not 2, it is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the next element in `palka`, `next_i` is the same as `i`. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `palka` has the next element appended to it at index `i`, `d[i]` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1, `next_i` is the same as `i`, and `pl` now contains the next element in `palka` at index `i`. Since there is no else part, these changes only occur if `i` is not in `pl`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
