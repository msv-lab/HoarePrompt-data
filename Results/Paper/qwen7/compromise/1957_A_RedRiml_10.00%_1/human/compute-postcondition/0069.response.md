Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `d` is a dictionary.
- The postcondition states that if the key `i` does not exist in `d`, it is added with a value of 1. If the key `i` exists in `d` and its value is not 1, its value is incremented by 1.

### Loop Head
- The loop iterates over the variable `i` in the sequence `palka`.

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `palka`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last element processed.

2. **Dictionary `d`:**
   - The dictionary `d` is modified based on the presence and value of the key `i`.
   - We need to consider two cases:
     - If `i` does not exist in `d`, it is added with a value of 1.
     - If `i` exists in `d` and its value is not 1, its value is incremented by 1.

### Adjusting the State
- Since the loop is about to start the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `palka`.
- The dictionary `d` will be checked and updated according to the rules mentioned.

### New State
- `i` will be the next element in `palka`.
- `d` will be checked for the presence of `i` and updated accordingly.

### Example Answer
State: **`d` is a dictionary, `i` is the next element in `palka`, if the key `i` does not exist in `d`, it is added with a value of 1. If the key `i` exists in `d` and its value is not 1, its value is incremented by 1.**

To be more precise, let's denote the next element in `palka` as `next_i`:

State: **`d` is a dictionary, `i` is `next_i`, if the key `next_i` does not exist in `d`, it is added with a value of 1. If the key `next_i` exists in `d` and its value is not 1, its value is incremented by 1.**
