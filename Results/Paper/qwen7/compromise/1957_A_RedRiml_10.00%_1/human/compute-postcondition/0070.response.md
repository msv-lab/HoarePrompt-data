Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with the key `next_i` having a value of 1, `i` is `next_i`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` (which is `next_i`) in dictionary `d` to 1. If the key `next_i` did not exist in `d` before, it is now added with a value of 1. If it existed and its value was not 1, it is incremented to 1. The variable `i` remains as `next_i`.
