Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in pl:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `pl`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `pl` and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `shapes` is 1 (this variable is not directly involved in the loop condition).
   - `pl` must have at least one element (this is a precondition for the loop to start, but it might have changed by the end of the previous iteration).
   - The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3 (this is true for the current value of `j`).

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the current index being processed in the loop, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `pl` must still have at least one element, and the new value of `d[j]` (which will be `d[j+1]` for the next iteration) must be greater than or equal to 3.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `shapes` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `pl` must still have at least one element.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so if `j` was the current index at the end of the previous iteration, the next `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - The new value of `d[j]` (which is `d[j+1]` for the next iteration) must be greater than or equal to 3.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`shapes` is 1, `pl` must have at least one element, `j` is the current index plus 1, and the new value of `d[j]` (which is `d[j+1]`) is greater than or equal to 3**.
