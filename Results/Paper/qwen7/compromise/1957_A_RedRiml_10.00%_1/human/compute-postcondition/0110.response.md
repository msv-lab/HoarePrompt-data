Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is now 1, and the current value of `d.get(i)` is 1.**

This means that the dictionary `d` has been updated such that the key `i` now maps to the value `1`. All other elements of the list `palka` and the rest of the dictionary `d` remain unchanged from their initial state.
