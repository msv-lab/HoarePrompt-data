Output State: **All elements in `palka` have been processed, `pl` contains all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its value is the count of how many times that element appeared in `palka`.**

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `w` remains greater than 0, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `ln` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `palka` is a list of integers that has been fully processed, meaning every element in `palka` has been considered in the loop.
- The variable `pl` is a list that contains all unique elements from `palka`, preserving their order of appearance.
- The variable `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that element appeared in `palka`.
