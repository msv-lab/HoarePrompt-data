Output State: **`shapes` is 3, `d` is a dictionary where each key from the list `palka` is mapped to its count in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, and `w` is decremented by 1, `ln` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `ln = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, storing it in the variable `ln`. The other variables (`shapes`, `d`, `pl`, and `w`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
