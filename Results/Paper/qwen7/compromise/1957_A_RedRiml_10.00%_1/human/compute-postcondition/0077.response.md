Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `d` is a dictionary.
- `i` is `next_i`.
- If `next_i` does not exist in `d`, it is added with a value of 2.
- If `next_i` exists in `d` and its value is not 2, it is incremented by 1.

### Loop Statement
```python
for i in palka:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `i` is set to each element in the iterable `palka`. The only variables directly involved in the loop head are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is set to each element in `palka` during each iteration, the value of `i` will change to the next element in `palka`.
   - The dictionary `d` and the value of `next_i` (which is the initial value of `i`) are modified inside the loop body, but these changes are not reflected in the loop head.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will be set to the next element in `palka`.
   - The postcondition of the loop body (modifying `d` based on `next_i`) does not affect the loop head directly.

### New State
- `i` will be set to the next element in `palka`.
- `next_i` will be the new value of `i`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is the next element in `palka`, `next_i` is the same as `i`**
