Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in pl:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `pl`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `pl` and the condition `d[j] >= 3` holds true.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `shapes` is 1
   - `j` is 1
   - `pl` must have at least one element
   - The current value of `d[j]` (which is `d[1]`) is greater than or equal to 3

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1, and `pl` must have at least one element, the loop will continue if `pl` still contains elements.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not modify `j`), so `j` will become 2.
   - The condition `d[j] >= 3` must still hold true for the next iteration. Therefore, `d[2]` must be greater than or equal to 3.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `shapes` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `j` is incremented to 2.
   - `pl` must still have at least one element.
   - The condition `d[j] >= 3` must hold true, so `d[2]` must be greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`shapes` is 1, `j` is 2, `pl` must have at least one element, and the current value of `d[j]` (which is `d[2]`) is greater than or equal to 3**
