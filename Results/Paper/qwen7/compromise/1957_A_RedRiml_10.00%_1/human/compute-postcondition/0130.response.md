Output State: **`d.get(i)` is 1, `pl` includes `i`, and `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of `d.get(i)` to 1. This means that if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`, it is now 1, and if `d.get(i)` was not `None`, it is incremented by 1, which results in 1 since setting it to 1 overwrites its previous value. Additionally, if `i` was not already in `pl`, it is added to `pl`. The value of `i` remains the next element in `palka` after `i_val`.
