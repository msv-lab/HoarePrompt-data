Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list with at least two elements containing the first element of `palka` and the next element of `palka` if it is not already in `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is set to 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None`, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by 1 for the next element of `palka`, where `i` is the next element of `palka`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `t` remains within the range 1 to 100, `w` remains greater than 0, `ln` remains unchanged, `palka` remains a list of at least one integer, `pl` contains the first element of `palka` and the next element of `palka` if it is not already in `pl`, and `d` is a dictionary where for each `i` (the next element of `palka`), `d[i]` is either set to 1 if `d.get(i)` was `None`, or incremented by 1 if `d.get(i)` was not `None`.
