Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a list element, and assigns this list to the variable `ar`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
