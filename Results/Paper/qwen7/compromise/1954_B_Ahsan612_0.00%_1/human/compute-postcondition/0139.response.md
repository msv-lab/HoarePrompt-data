To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`minn`**: 
   - It is the minimum value between the initial value of `minn` (either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1) and `same`.
   - Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it must have been initialized to a finite value.

2. **`same`**: 
   - This is the total number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the list `ar`.

3. **`num`**: 
   - This is the last element of the list `ar` that was checked, and it will be different from the first element if there was a change.

4. **`i`**: 
   - This is the length of the list `ar`.

Given these details, the `print(minn)` statement will simply print the value of `minn`.

Since the exact values of `minn`, `same`, `num`, and `i` are not specified, we can only describe `minn` based on the given conditions.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value between the initial value of minn (either 1 or the minimum value found in the list ar starting from index 1) and same)**
