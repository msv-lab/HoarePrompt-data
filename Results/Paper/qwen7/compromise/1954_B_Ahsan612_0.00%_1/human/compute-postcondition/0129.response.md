Output State: **`minn` is either 1 or the minimum value between 1 and 1, `same` is 1, `num` is the element at index `i+1` in the list `ar`, `i` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code sets `same` to 1. Since `same` was originally 2, it is now 1. The values of `minn`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `minn` is still either 1 or the minimum value between 1 and `same` (which is now 1), `same` is 1, `num` is the element at index `i+1` in the list `ar`, and `i` is increased by 1.
