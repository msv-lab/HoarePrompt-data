Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is 1, `num` is the third element of the list `ar`, `i` is 3**.

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`infinity`) and `same` (which is 1). Since 1 is less than infinity, `minn` is updated to 1. The values of `same`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged.
