Output State: **`i` is 2, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1**

Explanation: The line `same = 1` does not change the value of `same`, so it remains 1. The value of `i` is unchanged and stays as 2. The value of `num` is still `ar[i]`, which means `ar[2]` since `i` is 2. The value of `minn` is unchanged and remains as the minimum value between infinity and 1, which is 1.
