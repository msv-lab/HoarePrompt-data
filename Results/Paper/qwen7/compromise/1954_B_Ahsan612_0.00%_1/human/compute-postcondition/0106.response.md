Output State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `same` is 2, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `same` was initially set to 1. The code `same += 1` increments the value of `same` by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `minn` is still set to infinity, `same` is now 2, `num` is still the first element of the list `ar`, and `i` is still 1.
