You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        
        num = ar[0]
        
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: The final value of `minn` is determined as the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the entire list `ar` across all iterations. `same` holds the count of consecutive occurrences of the current number being processed, `num` is the current number being considered, and `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, the function determines the sum of n over all test cases and returns it.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
