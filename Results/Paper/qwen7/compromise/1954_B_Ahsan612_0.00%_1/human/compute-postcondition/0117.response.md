Output State: **`minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1, `same` is 1 or 2 depending on whether the current element matches the first element, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `i` is increased by 1 and is now less than `len(ar)`**.

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was initially less than `len(ar)`, after incrementing, `i` is still less than `len(ar)`. The values of `minn`, `same`, and `num` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.
