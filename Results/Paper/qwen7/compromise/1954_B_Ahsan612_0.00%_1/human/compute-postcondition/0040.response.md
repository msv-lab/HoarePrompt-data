Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`, `same` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`, `num` is the last number in the list `ar` that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences, and `minn` is the minimum value between `infinity` and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the smaller of its current value and the value of `same`. All other variables (`i`, `same`, `num`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
