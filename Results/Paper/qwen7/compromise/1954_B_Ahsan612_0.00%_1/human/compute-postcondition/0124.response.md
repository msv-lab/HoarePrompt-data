Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1.
   - `same` is 3 if the current element matches the first element, otherwise it is 2.
   - `num` is the first element of the list `ar`.
   - `i` is less than `len(ar) + 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` is currently less than `len(ar) + 1`, the only way to ensure the loop executes again is to increment `i` such that it remains less than `len(ar)`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. We need to ensure that `i` is incremented to a value that still satisfies the loop condition `i < len(ar)`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1, `same` is 3 if the current element matches the first element, otherwise it is 2, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, and `i` must be less than `len(ar)`**.
