Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`.
- `same` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`.
- `num` is the last number in the list `ar` that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences.
- `minn` is infinity and remains unchanged as it is equal to infinity.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the integer `-1` without referencing any of the other variables or their values.

Output: **-1**
