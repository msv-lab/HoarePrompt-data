Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations. This value is assigned to the underscore `_`, but since we don't need to know the exact value of `_`, we focus on the input itself.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the input value is a positive integer. Given the constraints, the input value (which we denote as `t`) must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop will run based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value meets the required condition. The initial state tells us that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, no adjustment is needed because the initial state already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
