Output State: **`i` is 2, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum value between infinity and 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`minn`) and the value of `same`. Initially, `minn` is the minimum value between infinity and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, which is effectively infinity since no other `same` value is mentioned. `same` is currently 1. Therefore, `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `infinity` and `1`, which remains `infinity`. The values of `i`, `num`, and `same` remain unchanged.
