Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num` to be equal to `ar[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `num` is now set to `ar[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
