Output State: **`i` is 2, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum value between infinity and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Since `i` was initially 2, `ar[i]` refers to the element at index 2 of the array `ar`. The other variables (`same`, `minn`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `ar[i]` is not equal to `num` is no longer true since `num` is now equal to `ar[i]`.
