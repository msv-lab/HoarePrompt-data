Output State: **`i` is 7 or 8; `num` is `min(minn, same)`**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between `minn` and `same`. However, since the initial value of `minn` is not specified, we assume it to be the initial value of `num` (either `ar[7]` or `ar[8]`). After executing the line `minn = min(minn, same)`, `minn` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `same`. Since `num` was initially set to either `ar[7]` or `ar[8]`, and `minn` is being updated to the minimum of itself and `same`, `num` will now be `min(minn, same)`. The values of `i` remain unchanged.
