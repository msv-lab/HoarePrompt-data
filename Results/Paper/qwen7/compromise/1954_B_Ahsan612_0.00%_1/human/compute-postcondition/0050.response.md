Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`, `same` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`, `num` is the last number in the list `ar` that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences, `minn` is the minimum value between `infinity` and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `same`, `num`, and `minn`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
