Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`.
- `same` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`.
- `num` is the last number in the list `ar` that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences.
- `minn` is the minimum value between `infinity` and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`. Also, `minn` is not equal to infinity.

The `print(minn)` statement will print the value of `minn`.

To understand the value of `minn`, let's break it down:

1. `same` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`.
2. `minn` is initialized to be the minimum value between `infinity` and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution.
3. During the loop, `minn` is updated to be the minimum of `minn` and `same`, ensuring that `minn` is always the smallest value encountered.

Given that `minn` is not equal to infinity, it means that there was at least one occurrence of `same` that was finite and thus `minn` is set to this finite value.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `minn`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value between infinity and the maximum same value found during the loop execution, and minn is not equal to infinity)**
