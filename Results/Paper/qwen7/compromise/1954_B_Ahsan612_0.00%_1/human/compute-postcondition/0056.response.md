Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `i` and `len(ar)`.
3. **Check the current state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to 1.
   - `len(ar)` is the length of the list `ar`.

4. **Determine if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute as long as `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `ar` is a list of integers created from input, `i` is 1, `same` is 1, `num` is now the first element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between infinity and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1**.
