Output State: **`minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`; `num` is set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found; `same` is 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input which is assigned to `n`. This updates the value of `n` to the input integer, while the states of `minn`, `num`, and `same` remain as per their initial description.
