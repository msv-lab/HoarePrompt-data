Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the postconditions**:
   - `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`.
   - `num` is set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found.
   - `same` is 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the number of iterations is determined by user input.
   - The loop will run one more time if the input value is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will depend on the user input.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The initial state does not provide specific values for `minn`, `num`, or `same`. We only know that `minn` is updated based on `same`, and `num` and `same` are set based on the conditions described.
   - For the next iteration, the loop will continue as long as the input is greater than 0.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`, `num` is set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found, `same` is 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value, and the loop will continue as long as the input is greater than 0.**

However, since we cannot specify the exact values of `minn`, `num`, and `same` without knowing the previous inputs, the most accurate representation of the state is:

**State: `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`, `num` is set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found, `same` is 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value, and the loop continues as long as the input is greater than 0.**

This can be summarized as:

**State: `minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`, `num` is set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found, `same` is 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value, and the loop continues as long as the input is greater than 0.**
