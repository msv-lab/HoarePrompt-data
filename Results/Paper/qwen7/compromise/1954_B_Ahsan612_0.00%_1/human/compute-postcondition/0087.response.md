Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar`. The variable `minn` will hold the minimum value between the initial `minn` (which was set to infinity) and the highest value of `same` encountered during the loop's execution. The variable `num` will be set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found, and `same` will be 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value.**

This means that after the loop finishes, `i` will point to one past the end of the list `ar`, `minn` will reflect the lowest count of consecutive identical numbers found during the loop, `num` will be the last value of `min(minn, same)` encountered, and `same` will reset to 1 if no more elements matched `num` after the last update.
