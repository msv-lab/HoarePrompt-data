Output State: **`i` is 5; `num` is `ar[5]`; `minn` is the minimum between `minn` and `same`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`minn`) and another variable `same`. Since the initial value of `minn` is not specified, it remains unchanged unless `same` is less than `minn`. The values of `i` and `num` remain the same as their initial states.
