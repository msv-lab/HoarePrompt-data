Postcondition: `minn` is set to infinity, `ar` is a list of integers created from input, `i` is 2, `same` is 1, `num` is now the first element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between infinity and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.
