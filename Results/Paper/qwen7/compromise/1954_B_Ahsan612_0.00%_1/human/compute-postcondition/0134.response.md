Output State: `minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1, `same` is the total number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the list `ar`, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was checked (which will be different from the first element if there was a change), and `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.

This final state occurs because the loop continues until `i` is no longer less than the length of the list `ar`. At this point, `i` will be equal to `len(ar)`, meaning all elements of the list have been processed. The variable `minn` will hold the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of any single element (including the first element) found during the loop's execution. If no such sequence was found, `minn` will remain as its initial value of 1. The variable `same` will reflect the longest sequence of consecutive occurrences of the first element encountered, or it will be the total count of consecutive occurrences if the first element changes. The variable `num` will be the last element of the list that was checked, which could be different from the first element if there was a change during the loop's execution.
