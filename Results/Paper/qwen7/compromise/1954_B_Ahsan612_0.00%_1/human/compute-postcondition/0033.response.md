Output State: **`i` is either 6 or 7, `same` is at least 1, `minn` is the minimum between `minn` and `same`, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum between `minn` and `same`.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value and `same`. Since `same` is at least 1, `minn` will be updated to `same` if `same` is less than the current value of `minn`. Otherwise, `minn` remains unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `same`, `num`, and the condition on `len(ar)`) remain unaffected.
