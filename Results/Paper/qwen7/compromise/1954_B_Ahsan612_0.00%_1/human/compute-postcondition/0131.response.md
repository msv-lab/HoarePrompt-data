Postcondition: `minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1, `same` is 4 if the current element matches the first element, otherwise it is 2, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, and `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. If the current element `ar[i]` is equal to the first element `num`, then `same` is set to 4. Otherwise, `minn` is set to 1, `same` is set to 1, `num` is updated to the element at index `i+1`, and `i` is incremented by 1.
