Output State: **`i` is either 6 or 7, `same` is 1, `minn` is the minimum between `minn` and 1, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code sets `same` to 1. This updates the value of `same` but does not affect the values of `i`, `minn`, or `num`. Since `same` was previously at least 1, setting it to 1 does not change the fact that `minn` is updated to be the minimum between `minn` and `same`. Therefore, `minn` remains the minimum between its original value and 1. The value of `num` remains unchanged as it is equal to `ar[i]`.
