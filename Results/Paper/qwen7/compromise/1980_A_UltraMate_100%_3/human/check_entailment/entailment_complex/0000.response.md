Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the key parts:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the string `a`.

2. **Character Counting**: It uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the string `a`.

3. **Calculation of Missing Problems**:
   - For each character from 'A' to 'G', it checks if the character is present in the counter.
   - If the character is not present, it assumes the count is zero and adds `m` to the answer.
   - If the character is present but its count is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to the answer.

4. **Output**: The final answer is printed for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic implemented in the function matches the requirements. The program handles all edge cases appropriately, including when certain difficulty levels are missing entirely from the input string.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
