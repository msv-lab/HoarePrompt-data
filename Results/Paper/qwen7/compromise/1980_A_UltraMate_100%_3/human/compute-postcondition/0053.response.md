Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 'H'
   - `p` is 'ABCDEFG'
   - `ans` is the value of `ans` before the operation plus `m` since `i` is 'H' and not in `hmp`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is 'H', it has already been processed in the current iteration.
   - The next character in `p` will be the first character, which is 'A'.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 'A'.

5. **Maintain the state of `p`**: The string `p` remains unchanged as the loop continues to iterate through its characters.

6. **Maintain the state of `ans`**: The state of `ans` should reflect that no operation has been performed yet for the new value of `i`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 'A'
- `p` is 'ABCDEFG'
- `ans` is the initial value of `ans` (since no operation has been performed yet for 'A')

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is the initial value of `ans`**
