Output State: **`i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `ans` is equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += m` adds the value of `m` to `ans`. However, since `ans` is not defined before this line of code, it is assumed to be 0 (as per Python's default behavior for undefined variables in addition operations). Therefore, `ans` is assigned the value of `m`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
