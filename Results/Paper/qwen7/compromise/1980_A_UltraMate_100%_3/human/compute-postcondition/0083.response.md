Output State: **`i` is 'G', `p` must contain at least one character, `ans` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in `s`. The character `i` is not in the Counter object `hmp`**.

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `m`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` now holds the value of `m`.
