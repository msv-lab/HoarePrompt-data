#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM". The value of `h1` is derived from the input `h` based on whether `h` is in the range 00-12 or 13-23. If `h` is 00-12, `h1` remains the same with 'AM' or 'PM' appended accordingly. If `h` is 13-23, `h1` is adjusted to reflect the correct hour in the 12-hour format with 'PM' appended. The value of `m` remains unchanged and is always a valid minute from 00 to 59.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of times in the 24-hour format and converts them into the corresponding 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It reads the number of test cases and for each case, it takes a time string in the format "hh:mm", converts the hour part to the 12-hour format, and prints the time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM". The function does not return any value but outputs the converted times.
