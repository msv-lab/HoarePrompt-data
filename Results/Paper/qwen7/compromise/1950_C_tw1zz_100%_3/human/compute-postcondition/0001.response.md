Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM". The values of `h1` and `m` are derived from the input time `h:m`, and the `time` (either AM or PM) is determined based on the value of `h`. The loop will process each input time and print the corresponding 12-hour format time with AM/PM notation.

For example, if the input is:
```
3
13:45
00:23
12:59
```

The output will be:
```
01 : 45 PM 
12 : 23 AM 
12 : 59 PM 
```
