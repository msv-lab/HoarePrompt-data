### Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func()` aims to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
3. **Hour Conversion**:
   - The function splits the input string `hh:mm` into `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes).
   - It then uses a series of `elif` statements to convert the hour part from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and determine whether it is AM or PM.
   - This approach works because it handles all possible values of `h` from 00 to 23 and correctly sets `h1` and `time` based on those values.

4. **Minute Handling**: The function correctly retains the minutes `m` without any modification.

5. **Output Format**: The function prints the converted time in the correct format "h1 : m AM/PM".

6. **Efficiency**: While the current implementation uses a series of `elif` statements, it is still correct and functional. However, it can indeed be optimized using a more concise method, such as using the modulo operation to handle the hour conversion. But the current implementation is still valid and meets the requirements.

### Evaluation:
- The function correctly converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and outputs the result in the required format.
- The logic, although repetitive, is correct and works as intended.
- The function handles all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.

Given these points, the original assessment was overly critical regarding the efficiency but did not accurately identify the correctness of the function. The function does meet the problem requirements and produces the correct output.

### Final:
**True**
