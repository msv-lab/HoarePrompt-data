### Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func()` aims to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It splits the input string `hh:mm` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. **Hour Conversion Logic**: The function uses a series of `elif` statements to convert the hour part from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and determine whether it is AM or PM. This logic is essentially correct, although it can be simplified.
4. **Minute Handling**: The minutes (`m`) remain unchanged, which is correct.
5. **Output Format**: The function prints the time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM", which matches the required output format.

However, the original assessment is overly critical and dismisses the function's correctness without providing a detailed analysis. Here are the key points to consider:

- **Efficiency**: While the function could be more efficient, the current implementation is still correct and functional. The use of `elif` statements is a straightforward way to handle the conversion, even though it is not the most optimized approach.
- **Correctness**: The function correctly handles all edge cases, including the conversion of hours from 00 to 23 and the determination of AM/PM.
- **Simplicity**: The current implementation is simple and easy to understand, which is often more valuable than a more complex but less readable solution.

Given these points, the function is indeed correct despite being somewhat inefficient. The original assessment overstates the issues and fails to recognize the correctness of the function.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The function correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and prints them in the required format, even though it could be more efficient.
