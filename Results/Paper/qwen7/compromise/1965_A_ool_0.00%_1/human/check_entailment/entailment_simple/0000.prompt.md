Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
    
    1
    
    1000000000

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

# Annotated Program:
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
c = 1
while t > 0:
    n = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    r = func_1(arr)
    print(r)
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, where the length of arr (denoted as n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each a_i in arr.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns the string 'Alice'
    #State: `A` is False, and `arr[0]` is equal to 1
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: `A` is True, `not_c` is True, and `arr[0]` is equal to 1, `set_` is [1]
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i=1` to `len(set_)`, but since `set_` only contains one element `[1]`, the loop does not execute at all. Therefore, the value of `A` toggles once (from False to True) and `not_c` remains True. The values of `arr[0]` and `set_` remain unchanged.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: Postcondition: `A` is True, `not_c` is True, `arr[0]` is equal to 1, and `set_` is [1]. This is because the loop does not execute due to the condition `not_c` being True, so `A` toggles from its initial state of True to False and then back to True, while `not_c` remains True. The values of `arr[0]` and `set_` remain unchanged.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice'
