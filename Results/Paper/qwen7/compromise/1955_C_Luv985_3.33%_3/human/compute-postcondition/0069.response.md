Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is `r - 2`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is 5, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `a[l]` is decreased by `mi` if `a[r]` is 0. Otherwise, `r` is `r - 1`, `ans` remains 4, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`.**
