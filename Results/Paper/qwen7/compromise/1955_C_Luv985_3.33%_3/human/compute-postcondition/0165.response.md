Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` is an integer converted from the original string `n`; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting each string in the original list `a` to an integer using map and lambda.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` applies the lambda function `lambda x: int(x)` to each element in the list `a`. This converts each string in the list `a` to an integer. The other variables (`T`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
