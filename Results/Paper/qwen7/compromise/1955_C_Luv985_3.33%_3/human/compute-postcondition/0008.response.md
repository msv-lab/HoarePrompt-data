Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda function.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))` converts each string in the list `a` into an integer using the `map` function and `lambda` function. The initial state of `a` being a list of strings is updated to a list of integers. The values of `T`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
