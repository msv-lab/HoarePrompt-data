Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a` is a list of integers where `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, `ans` is 4, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `a[l]` equals 0, then `l` is incremented by 1. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows the if part.
