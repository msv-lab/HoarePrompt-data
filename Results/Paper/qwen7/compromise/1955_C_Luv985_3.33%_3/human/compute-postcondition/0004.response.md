Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is a string from the input, `k` is a string from the input**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Since the initial state only mentions `T` being `T - 1`, we keep that unchanged while introducing `n` and `k` as strings from the input.
