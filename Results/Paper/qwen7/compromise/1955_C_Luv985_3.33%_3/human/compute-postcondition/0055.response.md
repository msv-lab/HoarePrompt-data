Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` must be less than `r`, `r` must be greater than `l`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, and `t` is `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, the postcondition remains as the precondition.**
