Output State: **`T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` must be less than `r`, `r` must be greater than `l`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code increments `ans` by 1, so `ans` changes from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
