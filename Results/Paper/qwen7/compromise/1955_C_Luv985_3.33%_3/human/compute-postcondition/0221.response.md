Output State: **`l` is 2, `r` is one less than its original value, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `ans` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. All other variables (`l`, `k`, `mi`, `a[r]`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `r` is now one less than its original value, while `l` remains 2, `k` is still `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is still the minimum value between `a[1]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is still reduced by `mi`, and `ans` is still increased by 1.
