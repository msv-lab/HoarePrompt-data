Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since no other operations or assignments are performed, the only change is that `T` now holds the value of the input integer. The precondition that `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4 remains valid.
