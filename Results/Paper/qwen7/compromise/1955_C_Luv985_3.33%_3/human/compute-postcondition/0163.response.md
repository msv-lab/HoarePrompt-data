Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1; `n` is an integer converted from the original string `n`; `k` is an integer converted from the original string `k`.**

Explanation: The code `k = int(k)` converts the string `k` into an integer and assigns it back to `k`. The values of `T` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `T` is still a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is still an integer converted from the original string `n`, and `k` is now an integer converted from the original string `k`.
