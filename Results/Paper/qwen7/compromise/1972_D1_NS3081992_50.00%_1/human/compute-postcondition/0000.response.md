Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6, and they have been reassigned to the values returned by `func_7()`**.

This means that the function `func_7()` has returned two new values for `n` and `m`, which are still within the range of positive integers between 1 and 2*10^6. The exact values of `n` and `m` depend on what `func_7()` returns, but they are guaranteed to be positive integers within the specified range.
