Output State: `i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the sum of all `f` values entered as input over the course of the loop's iterations, `u` is the second integer input from the last split, `v` is the third integer input from the last split, `f` is the fourth integer input from the last split.

In this final state, the variable `i` will be one less than `m` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `m-1`. The variable `a` accumulates the sum of all `f` values provided as input during each iteration of the loop. The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` retain their values from the last input split since they are only assigned within the loop body and not reset between inputs.
