Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, and k. Additionally, it processes m lines of input for each test case, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. The function returns a result based on the processed inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with specific parameters and additional friend relationships, without accepting any parameters directly. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.
