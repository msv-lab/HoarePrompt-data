Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `c` is \(n \cdot (n - 1)\), `a` is the sum of all integers `f` provided as input over the course of the loop's execution, `u` is the last integer from the input, `v` is the second last integer from the input, `f` is the last integer from the input, `s` is `s + c * (i_prev + 1) * c * m + c * a**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, making it `i_prev + 2`. The variable `c` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the operation. The variable `a` also remains unchanged as it is the sum of all integers `f` provided as input over the course of the loop's execution. The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` remain the same as they are the last, second last, and last integer from the input respectively. The variable `s` is updated to `s + c * (i_prev + 1) * c * m + c * a`.
