Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `s` is 0, `i` is `k + m + n - 1`, `c` is `n * (n - 1) // 1`, `a` is the sum of all integers `f` provided as input over the course of the loop's execution, `u` is the last integer from the input, `v` is the second last integer from the input, `f` is the last integer from the input.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `k + m + n - 1`, reflecting the total number of times the loop has run. The variable `s` remains unchanged at 0, and `c` also remains unchanged as it was initially set. The variable `a` accumulates the sum of all `f` values provided as input. Additionally, `u`, `v`, and `f` will hold the values of the last input triplet processed by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is 0 + c * i * c * m + c * a, `c` is `n * (n - 1) // 1`, `a` is the sum of all integers `f` provided as input over the course of the loop's execution, `u` is the last integer from the input, `v` is the second last integer from the input, `f` is the last integer from the input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `c` is \(n \cdot (n - 1)\), `a` is the sum of all integers `f` provided as input over the course of the loop's execution, `u` is the last integer from the input, `v` is the second last integer from the input, `f` is the last integer from the input, `s` is `s + c * (i_prev + 1) * c * m + c * a

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `i_prev + 3`, `c` is \(n \cdot (n - 1)\), `a` is the sum of all integers `f` provided as input over the course of the loop's execution, `u` is the last integer from the input, `v` is the second last integer from the input, `f` is the last integer from the input, `s` is `s + c * (i_prev + 1) * c * m + 2 * c * a




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
