Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `m-1`, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is the sum of all `f` values entered as input over the course of the loop's iterations, `u` is the second integer input from the last split, `v` is the third integer input from the last split, `f` is the fourth integer input from the last split.

In this final state, the variable `i` will be one less than `m` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `m-1`. The variable `a` accumulates the sum of all `f` values provided as input during each iteration of the loop. The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` retain their values from the last input split since they are only assigned within the loop body and not reset between inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 0, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 1, `s` is now `2 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 2, `s` is 3 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
