Output State: **`i` is `k`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input and must be greater than 0, `s` is `k * (c * k * c * m + c * a)`, `c` is `(n * (n - 1) // 1) ** -1 % M`, `M` is 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `c` using the formula `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. Here, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
