Output State: **`s` is `c * (k + m - 1) * c * m * m + c * a * m`, `i` is `k + m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is `10 ** 9 + 7`**

The code assigns the value `10 ** 9 + 7` to the variable `M`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`s`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`). Therefore, the output state retains the values of `s`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` from the initial state, and includes the new value of `M`.
