Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `k + 1` and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 1. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are now specific integers obtained from the input.
