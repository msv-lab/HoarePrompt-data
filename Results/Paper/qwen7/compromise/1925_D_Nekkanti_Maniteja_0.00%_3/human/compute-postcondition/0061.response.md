Output State: **`s` is 0, `i` is `k + m + 1`, `c` is `n * (n - 1) // 1`, `a` is `a + f`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `u` is updated to the first integer from the input, `v` is updated to the second integer from the input, `f` is updated to the third integer from the input**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The other variables (`s`, `i`, `c`, `a`) remain unchanged.
