Output State: **`i` is `k`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input split by spaces and converts each part into an integer, assigning them to `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged.
