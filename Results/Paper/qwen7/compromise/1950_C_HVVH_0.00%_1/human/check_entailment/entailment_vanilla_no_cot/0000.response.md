Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that need to be corrected:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Midnight and Noon:**
   - When `h` is 0, it should be treated as 12 AM, but the current logic sets it to 12 PM.
   - When `h` is 12, it should remain 12 PM unless `h` becomes 0 after adjusting for PM, in which case it should be 12 AM.

2. **Day Initialization:**
   - The variable `day` is initialized outside the loop and reused incorrectly. It should be reset to 'AM' at the start of each test case.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM' if h != 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d} {day}')


func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the time is correctly converted to 12-hour format and handles the special cases for midnight and noon appropriately.
