Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the last time conversion in the loop, `n` is the number of times the loop has executed.

Explanation: The loop processes a series of time inputs and adjusts them to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. After all iterations, the final value of `day` will be determined by the last time conversion operation performed, and `n` will be the total number of times the loop has run. The value of `t` remains unchanged unless it is modified within the loop, which it is not in this case.
