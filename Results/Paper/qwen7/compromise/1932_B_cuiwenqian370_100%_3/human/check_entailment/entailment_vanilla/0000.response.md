Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It initializes an index variable to keep track of the current position in the data list.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It calculates the year when the last sign occurs by iterating through the periodicities and updating the `last_year` accordingly.

3. **Calculating the Year**:
   - For each periodicity `a[i]`, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur after the previous sign has occurred.
   - This calculation uses the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` to find the next multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Storing Results**:
   - It stores the final year for each test case in the `results` list.

5. **Output**:
   - It writes the results to the standard output, joining them with newlines.

### Correctness Check

1. **Formula Verification**:
   - The formula used to calculate the next year is correct. It ensures that the next year is a multiple of `a[i]` and strictly greater than `last_year`.

2. **Logic Flow**:
   - The logic flow is correct. It correctly updates `last_year` for each sign and calculates the correct year when the last sign occurs.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases efficiently by reading all input at once and processing each one sequentially.
   - It correctly handles the periodicities and ensures that the years are calculated correctly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and calculations are correct according to the problem description. The program processes the input correctly and computes the required years accurately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
