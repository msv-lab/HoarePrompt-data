Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `last_year` is equal to `next_year`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, after the first iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0. However, since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - The state of `last_year` and `next_year` remains unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`**
