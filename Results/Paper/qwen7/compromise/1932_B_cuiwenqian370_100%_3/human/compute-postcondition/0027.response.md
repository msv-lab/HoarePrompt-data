Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `i` is `n+1`, `last_year` is unchanged, `results` is a list containing integers converted from the string at index `index` to `index + n`, and `index` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` converts a slice of the `data` list, starting from `index` and ending at `index + n`, into a list of integers. The original values of `T`, `i`, `last_year`, and `index` remain unchanged, but `results` now contains these integers. The `index` is also increased by 1 as per the initial state.
