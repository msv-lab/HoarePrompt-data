Output State: **`i` is `n`, `last_year` is the final value obtained by applying the update rule `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]` for each `i` from `1` to `n-1`, and `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` for each iteration of T.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet does not change any of the variables `i`, `last_year`, or `results`. Instead, it writes the contents of the `results` list to the standard output, each element separated by a newline. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The `i` variable is already set to `n` as per the initial state, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The `last_year` variable holds the final computed value after processing all elements in the list `a` for each of the `T` iterations. The `results` list contains the string representation of `last_year` for each iteration.
