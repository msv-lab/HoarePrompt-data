Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Analyze the given states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 1`: This means that `i` was incremented in the previous iteration.
   - `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`: This expression updates `last_year` based on the current value of `i` and some array `a`.
   - `results` is a list of integers: This list remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `next_year` is undefined: This variable is not part of the loop head.
   - `last_year` is updated to the value of `next_year`: This means that after the loop, `last_year` will take the value of `next_year`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `i + 2` (since `i` was `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `last_year` is updated to `next_year` after the loop, but since we are adjusting the state before the loop, we keep `last_year` as it is.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` needs to be set to `i + 2` to satisfy the condition `i < n` for the next iteration.
   - `last_year` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `results` and `next_year` are not part of the loop head and remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, `results` is a list of integers, `next_year` is undefined**
