Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`, `n` is an input integer, `index` is `index + n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`**.

Explanation: The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `index` is the original value of `index` plus `n`.
