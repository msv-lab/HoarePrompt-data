Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `i` is `n+1`, `last_year` is unchanged, `results` is a list containing integers converted from the string at index `index` to `index + n`, `index` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `index` has been incremented by `n`, while the other variables (`T`, `i`, `last_year`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
