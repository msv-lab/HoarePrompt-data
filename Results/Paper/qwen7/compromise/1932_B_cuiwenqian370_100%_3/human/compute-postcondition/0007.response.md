Output State: **`T` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The condition that `T` must be at least 1 remains unchanged, and the new information is that `n` now holds an integer value from `data[index]`.
