Output State: **`i` is 1, `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, the formula simplifies to `(last_year + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`. Since `i` must be less than `n`, the condition is still valid, but `n` itself is not specified, so it remains part of the precondition. The value of `i` does not change, but it is now used in the calculation of `next_year`.
