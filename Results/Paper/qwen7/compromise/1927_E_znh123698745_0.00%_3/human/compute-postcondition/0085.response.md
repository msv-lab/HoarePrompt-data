Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1, `answer` is updated with the element at index `array[a[-1]]`**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decreases the last element of list `a` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `a[-1]` other than it being an integer greater than 3 (because `n` must be greater than 3), we only know that `a[-1]` is now one less than its initial value. The value of `i` remains 3, `n` must still be greater than 3, and `answer` is updated with the element at the new index `a[-1]` in the array.
