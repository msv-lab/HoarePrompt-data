Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `(-1)^i` is equal to 1, `answer` now contains the element `array[a[0]]` from the original list.**

Explanation: The code appends `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`. Since `i` is 1, `(-1)^i` equals 1, which remains unchanged. The conditions for `n` and `(-1)^i` stay the same, and `a[0]` is used to index into `array` to get the element that is appended to `answer`.
