Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a[0]` is 1, `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3. The condition that `n` must be greater than 3 also remains unchanged. The value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1, making it 1 (assuming `a[0]` was initially 0). The `answer` list has an element appended from `array[a[0]]`, which means an element from `array[1]` has been appended to `answer`.
