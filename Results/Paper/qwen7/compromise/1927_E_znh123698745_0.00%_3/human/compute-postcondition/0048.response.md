Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `array` is unchanged, `a`[-1] is decreased by 1, `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[-1]]`**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decreases the last element of the list `a` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `n` is still an input integer, `array` remains unchanged, `a`[-1] is decreased by 1, and `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[-1]]`.
