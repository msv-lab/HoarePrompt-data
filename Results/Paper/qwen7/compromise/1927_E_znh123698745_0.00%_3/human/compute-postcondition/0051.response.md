Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` is an input integer. If `(-1) ** i` equals -1 (which is true since `i` is 2), then `array` remains unchanged, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1, and `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[-1]]`. Otherwise, `array` remains unchanged, `a` is set to [1], and `answer` has an element appended which is `array[1]`.
