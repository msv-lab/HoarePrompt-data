Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables in the loop head are `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `int(input())`. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable, it does not affect the loop execution directly. The key variable here is `int(input())`, which represents the number of iterations `n` for the loop.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n-1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, and the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-2` (since the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n-1`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n-1`. The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the start of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be set to `n-1`. The other variables (`a` and `array`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the same as before, `a` remains unchanged, `array` remains unchanged.**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is the same as before, `a` remains unchanged, `array` remains unchanged**
