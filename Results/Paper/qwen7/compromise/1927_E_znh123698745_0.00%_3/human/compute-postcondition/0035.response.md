Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to n, `answer` is a list containing the number 1, `a` is a list containing `[1, -1]`.**

The code initializes a new list `a` with the values `[1, -1]`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `array`, or `answer`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
