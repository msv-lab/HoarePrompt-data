Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `answer` contains the element at index `array[a[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at the index specified by `a[-1]` from the array `array` to the list `answer`. However, the initial values and conditions of `i`, `n`, and `a` are not explicitly given, so we only know that `i` remains 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `answer` now includes the element at the index `a[-1]` from `array`.
