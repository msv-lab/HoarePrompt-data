Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 2
   - `array` is unchanged
   - `a` is such that either `a[-1]` is decreased by 1 and `answer` has a new element which is `array[a[-1]]`, or `a[0]` is incremented to 1 and `answer` has an element appended which is `array[a[0]]`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from 2 to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than or equal to 3 (since it was initially greater than or equal to 2 and now needs to be greater than 2).

6. **State of `array` and `a`**:
   - The problem does not specify any changes to `array` or `a` within the loop body, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `array` is unchanged, `a` is such that either `a[-1]` is decreased by 1 and `answer` has a new element which is `array[a[-1]]`, or `a[0]` is incremented to 1 and `answer` has an element appended which is `array[a[0]]`**.
