Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and \((-1)^i\) is equal to 1, `a[0]` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` by 1. Initially, `a[0]` was equal to 1 (since `array[a[0]]` was added to `answer` and `a[0]` starts from 0). After incrementing, `a[0]` becomes 2. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
