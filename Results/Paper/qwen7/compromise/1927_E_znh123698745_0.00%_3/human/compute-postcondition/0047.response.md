Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `array` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[-1]]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends an element to the list `answer`. However, the values of `i`, `n`, `array`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value appended to `answer` is the element at the index `a[-1]` in the list `array`. Since the exact values of `array` and `a` are not provided, they are left as unchanged.
