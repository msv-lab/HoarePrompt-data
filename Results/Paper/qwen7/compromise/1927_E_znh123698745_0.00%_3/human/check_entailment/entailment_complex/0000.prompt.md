Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        answer = [1]
        
        a = [1, -1]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        
        print(*answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is an `answer` list of length `n-1`. This list is constructed by iterating through the range from 1 to `n-1` and appending elements from the `array` list based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, for each odd `i`, the last element of `a` (either `a[-1]` or `a[0]`) is used to index into `array` and append the corresponding element to `answer`. For each even `i`, the first element of `a` (either `a[-1]` or `a[0]`) is adjusted and then used to index into `array` to append the corresponding element to `answer`.
    #
    #After all iterations, `a[-1]` will be reduced to `2-n` and `a[0]` will be increased to `n-1`. Therefore, the `answer` list will contain elements from `array` in a specific pattern determined by these adjustments. The exact elements in `answer` depend on the initial values of `n` and the behavior of the loop, but it will always be a permutation of the elements from 1 to `n` excluding one element, which is 1.
    #
    #For example, if `n=4`, the `answer` list might look like `[1, 4, 3, 2]` or any other permutation of `[2, 3, 4]` since 1 is the first element in `answer` and the rest are derived from `array` based on the loop's conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing integers `n` and `k` (with `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` being even). For each test case, it constructs a list `answer` of length `n-1` by iterating through the range from 1 to `n-1`. During each iteration, it appends elements from a predefined list `array` (containing numbers from 1 to `n`) to `answer` based on specific conditions involving two indices `a[0]` and `a[-1]`. After processing all test cases, it prints the `answer` list for each case. The final state of the program is that it has printed the constructed `answer` lists for all given test cases.
