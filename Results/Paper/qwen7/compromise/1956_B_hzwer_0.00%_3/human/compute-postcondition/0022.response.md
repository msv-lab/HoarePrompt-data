Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`; `j` is 1; `n` is 5.**

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of three possible values: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The value of `j` remains 1, and `n` remains 5. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
