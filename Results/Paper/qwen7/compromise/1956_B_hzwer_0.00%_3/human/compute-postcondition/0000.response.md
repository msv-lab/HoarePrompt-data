Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state values for `t` and the list of integers remain unchanged. The variable `n` is updated to the integer input value.
