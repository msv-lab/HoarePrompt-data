Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `j` is being decremented from `n-1` to `0`.
   - The loop condition is `j in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, meaning `j` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is `n - 1`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `dp[i][j]` is calculated based on the count of `j + 1` in `cards`

3. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop decrements `j` by 1, the new value of `j` will be `n - 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The calculation of `dp[i][j]` does not affect the values of `j` or `n` directly; it only uses these values to compute the `dp` table.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which will be `n - 2` in the next iteration.

**State:**
**`j` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 0, and `dp[i][j]` is calculated as follows: if the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 1, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is greater than 1, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**
