Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `cards` is a list of integers.
- `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the given rules.
- No other variables are affected.

### For Loop Head
The for loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `n-1` to `0`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the valid range, i.e., `0 <= j < n`.

Given that the loop is iterating in reverse, at the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` was decremented by 1 from its value at the start of the current iteration.
- `n` remains unchanged.

### Adjusting the States
- Since `j` is decremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be one less than its value at the end of the current iteration.
- `n` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.

### Example Calculation
Assume at the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 2 (for example).
- `n` is 5 (for example).

For the next iteration:
- `j` will be 1.
- `n` remains 5.

### Final State
State: **`cards` is a list of integers, and `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the given rules, where `j` is 1 and `n` is 5.**

So, the final state is:

State: **`cards` is a list of integers, and `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the given rules, `j` is 1, `n` is 5.**
