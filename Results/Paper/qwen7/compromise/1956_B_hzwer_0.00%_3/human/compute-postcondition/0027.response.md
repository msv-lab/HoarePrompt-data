Output State: **`cards` is a list of integers, `dp[i][1]` is updated based on the following rules: if there is no occurrence of `2` in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][1]`. Otherwise, `dp[i][1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][1]`, `dp[i + 2][0] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][2]` if `cards.count(2) == 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates `dp[i][1]` based on the presence of the number `2` in the list `cards`. If `2` does not exist in `cards`, `dp[i][1]` is set to `dp[i + 1][1]`. If `2` exists exactly once in `cards`, `dp[i][1]` is set to the maximum of three values: `dp[i + 1][1]`, `dp[i + 2][0] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][2]`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
