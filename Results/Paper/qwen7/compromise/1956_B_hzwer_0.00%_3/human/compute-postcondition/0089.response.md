Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is now determined by taking the maximum of three expressions: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The values of `j` and the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
