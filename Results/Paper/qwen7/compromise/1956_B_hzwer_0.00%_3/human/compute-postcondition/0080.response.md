Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.**

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is set to the larger of the two values: `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
