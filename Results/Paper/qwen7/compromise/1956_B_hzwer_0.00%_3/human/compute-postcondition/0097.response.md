Output State: **The program returns the maximum value obtainable when starting from index 0 and considering the conditions provided within the loop.**

This means that the program calculates the optimal solution for the entire problem by iterating through the `cards` list and updating the `dp` table according to the given conditions. After completing all iterations, the value in `dp[0][0]` represents the best possible outcome for the entire problem, and this value is returned.
