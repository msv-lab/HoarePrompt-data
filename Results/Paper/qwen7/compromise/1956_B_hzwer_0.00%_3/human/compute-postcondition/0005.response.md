Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is being modified within the loop. The loop also references `n`, which is used to define the range of the loop.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n-3` to `-1` in reverse order. This means `i` will take values starting from `n-3` down to `0`.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` initialized with 0's.
   - `dp[n-1][0]` is 0.
   - `dp[n-2][0]` is 0.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop starts at `i = n-3` and goes down to `i = -1`, the initial value of `i` should be set to `n-3`.
   - The variable `n` is required to define the range of the loop, so it should be kept as is or adjusted if necessary.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is `n-3`, `n` is as defined**.
