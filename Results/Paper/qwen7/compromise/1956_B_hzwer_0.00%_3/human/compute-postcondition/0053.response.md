Postcondition: `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the following conditions: if `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. Otherwise, if `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. If `cards.count(j + 1) > 1`, `dp[i][j]` is assigned the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
