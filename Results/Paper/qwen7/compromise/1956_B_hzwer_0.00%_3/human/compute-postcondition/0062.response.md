Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `dp[i][j]` will contain the maximum value among the following possibilities for each `i` and `j`:

- `dp[i + 1][j]`
- `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`
- `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`

This maximum value is determined based on the count of `j + 1` in the list `cards`:
- If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- If `cards.count(j + 1) > 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

The loop iterates from `j = n - 1` down to `j = 0`, updating the `dp` table accordingly until all iterations are complete. The final state of `dp[i][j]` reflects the optimal value considering the constraints provided by the `cards` list.
