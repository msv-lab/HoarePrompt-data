Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is given as `n-3`.
   - `n` is as defined (its value is known but not specified here).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means the loop will run as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `j` must be initialized to a value that satisfies the loop condition (`j >= -1`).
   - Since `j` starts at `n-1` (as per the `range` function), we need to ensure that `n-1` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - The variable `i` is not directly involved in the loop condition and can remain as `n-3`.
   - The variable `n` must be such that `n-1 >= -1`, which simplifies to `n >= 0`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.

**State:**
**`i` is `n-3`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
