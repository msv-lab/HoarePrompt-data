### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code against the problem description and the original assessment.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.
   - The array `a` is correctly constructed from the input string.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `c` as an argument.
   - It checks if the length of `c` is 2.
     - If true, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2".
     - If false, it prints "13 0".

3. **Hardcoded Output**:
   - The function `func_1` does not process the actual elements of the array `a`.
   - It always prints hardcoded values based on the length of the input list `c`.

4. **Problem Description**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing operations.
   - The operations involve setting a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
   - The solution should handle any length of the array within the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 2` and input `[0, 1]`, the program outputs "4 1" and "1 2", which is correct for this specific case.
   - For `n = 3` and input `[1, 3, 9]`, the program outputs "13 0", which is also correct for this specific case.
   - For `n = 4` and input `[1, 100, 2, 1]`, the program outputs "13 0", which is incorrect because the maximum sum can be achieved by setting all elements to 100, resulting in a sum of 400.

6. **General Case**:
   - The program does not handle the general case where the array length is greater than 2.
   - It always prints "13 0" for arrays of length greater than 2, which is incorrect.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements. It relies on hardcoded outputs based on the length of the input array, which fails to handle the general case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly maximize the sum of the array elements for all possible input lengths and values.
