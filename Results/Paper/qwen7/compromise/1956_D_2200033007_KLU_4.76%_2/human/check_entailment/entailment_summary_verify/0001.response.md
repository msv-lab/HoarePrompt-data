### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements of the array `a` by performing up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations. Each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of that subarray.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never called with the actual length of the array `a`.
   - The function `func_1` checks if the length of the list `c` is exactly 2. If true, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2". Otherwise, it prints "13 0".
   - This hardcoded logic does not depend on the input array `a` and thus cannot be considered correct for arbitrary inputs.

3. **Hardcoded Outputs**:
   - The hardcoded outputs "4 1" and "1 2" for the case when the length of the array is 2 do not account for the actual input array `a`. Similarly, the hardcoded output "13 0" for other lengths does not consider the actual elements of the array `a`.

4. **Implementation Issues**:
   - The program does not implement the logic to find the MEX and update the array based on the input.
   - The function `func_1` is not called with the actual length of the array `a`, making the program ineffective for solving the problem.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The hardcoded outputs do not account for the actual input array `a` and thus cannot be considered correct for arbitrary inputs.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
