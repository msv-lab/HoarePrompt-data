Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, and `ans` is increased by 1; `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
