Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is `ans + 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`**.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `T` decreases by 1, `n` remains as the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` is adjusted by subtracting `2 * mi`, `a` remains a list of integers, `l` becomes 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` increases by 1, and `mi` remains as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`.
