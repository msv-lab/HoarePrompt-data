Output State: **`mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `l` < `r`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[l] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[l]`. Here, `mi` is defined as the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`. After executing the code, `a[l]` is updated to its original value minus `mi`. The other variables (`mi`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
