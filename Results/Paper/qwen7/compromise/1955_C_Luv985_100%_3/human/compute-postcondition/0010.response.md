Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using `map` and `lambda`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**.

This means that the variable `r` is now assigned the value of `n - 1`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
