Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using `map` and `lambda`, `l` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `l = 0` initializes the variable `l` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables `T`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
