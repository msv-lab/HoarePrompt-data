Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `while l < r and k > 0`.
   - Variables involved: `l`, `r`, and `k`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `k > 0`.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `l` is either 1 or 0.
   - `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`.
   - `k` is adjusted according to the condition (either `k` is `k - mi * 2` or remains greater than 0).

4. **Check the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For `l < r` to be true, `l` must be 1 and `r` must be `n - 2` (since `n - 1` would make `l == r`).
   - For `k > 0` to be true, `k` must be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `l` is either 1 or 0, for the loop to continue, `l` must be 1.
   - Since `r` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, for the loop to continue, `r` must be `n - 2`.
   - Since `k` is adjusted according to the condition (either `k` is `k - mi * 2` or remains greater than 0), for the loop to continue, `k` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `r` to ensure they meet the conditions for the loop to continue, and `k` must remain greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is the first element of the list obtained from `input().split()` converted to an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element has been converted to an integer using `map(lambda x: int(x), a)`, `l` must be 1, `r` must be `n - 2`, `ans` is either `ans + 1` or 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is greater than 0.**
