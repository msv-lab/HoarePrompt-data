Output State: **`T` is `T - 1 - 2 * mi`, `n` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `l` must be less than `r`, `r` is now `r - 1`, and `l` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the variable `r` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables retain their previous relationships and values as described in the initial state.
