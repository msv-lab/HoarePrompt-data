Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is a string from the input**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(n)` converts the string `n` into an integer. The value of `T` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was a string from the input.
