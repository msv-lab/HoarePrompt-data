Output State: **`T` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` remains unchanged, `mi` is `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, and `ans` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. All the other variables retain their previous states.
