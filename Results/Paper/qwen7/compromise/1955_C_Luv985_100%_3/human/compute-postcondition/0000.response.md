Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, the code has defined an empty block (pass statement) which does not affect the values of the variables.**

The given code is an empty block (indicated by `pass`), which does not perform any operations or assignments. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
