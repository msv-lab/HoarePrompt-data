Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. 

3. **Initial state of relevant variables**:
   - `total_costs` is an empty list.
   - `costs` is a list of length `n`.
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original values.
   - `rows` retains its original structure and values.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, the loop will execute as long as `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
   - For the loop to start, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0. This ensures that there are enough elements in the `costs` list to satisfy the condition for at least one iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should start from 0.
- `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `total_costs` is an empty list.
- `costs` is a list of length `n`.
- `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original values.
- `rows` retains its original structure and values.

We need to ensure that `len(costs) - (k - 1) > 0`.

State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, costs is a list of length `n`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original values, rows retains its original structure and values, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
