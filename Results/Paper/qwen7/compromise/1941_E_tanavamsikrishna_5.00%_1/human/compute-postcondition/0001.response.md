Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces; rows is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.**

Explanation: The code reads an input that consists of space-separated integers and assigns them to `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. It then creates a list of `n` lists (`rows`), where each inner list contains `m` positive integers (representing the depths of the river cells), with the first and last elements of each inner list being 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` are updated accordingly, while the initial values of `k` and `d` remain unchanged from their input assignments.
