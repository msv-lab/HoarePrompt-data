You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m, k, d) are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: Output State: `total_costs` is a list of length `n - (k - 1)`, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list starting from index `i` to `i + k - 1` for each iteration `i` in `range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original values; `rows` retains its original structure and values.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of k consecutive elements from the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d, all of which are integers with specific constraints. It also accepts a list named rows, which contains n lists, each with m positive integers. The function returns a value based on certain conditions involving these parameters and the list.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
