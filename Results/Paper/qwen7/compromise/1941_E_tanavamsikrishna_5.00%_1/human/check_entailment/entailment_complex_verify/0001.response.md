### Reasoning

The original assessment is correct. Let's break down the analysis and verify each part of the program to ensure it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`
1. **Initial Setup**: The function starts by incrementing the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1.
2. **Dynamic Programming Update**: For each element starting from `d-1` to the end of the row, it calculates the minimum cost required to place a support at that position. This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
3. **Return the Last Element**: Finally, the function returns the last element of the processed row, which represents the total cost for that row.

The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly implements the constraints for placing supports.

#### Function `func_2`
1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from the input, followed by the `n` rows of the river.
2. **Cost Calculation**: It applies the `func_1` function to each row to compute the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: It iterates through the list of costs for each possible starting row of the `k` bridges and calculates the sum of costs for each set of `k` consecutive rows.
4. **Result Output**: It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

The logic in `func_2` is also sound and correctly implements the logic for finding the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
