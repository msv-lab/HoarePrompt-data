Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly handle the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The function incorrectly calculates the cost for each row without considering the constraint on the distance between supports.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 4 1 2
0 1 2 0
0 2 1 0
0 1 2 0
```

The correct approach would be to ensure that the supports are placed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, the current implementation does not enforce this constraint. Instead, it simply adds a cost of 1 to each cell and updates the cost based on the minimum cost from the previous cells within the range `d`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the supports are placed optimally while respecting the distance constraint. This involves dynamic programming or a similar approach to keep track of the minimum cost for placing supports while maintaining the required distance between them.
