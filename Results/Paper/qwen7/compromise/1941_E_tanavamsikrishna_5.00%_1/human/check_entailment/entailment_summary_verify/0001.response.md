### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis to confirm the correctness of the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly processes each row to ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to update the cost of placing supports, ensuring that the cost is minimized while adhering to the constraints.
   - The function returns the total cost for the row after processing.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly parses the input and applies `func_1` to each row to get the minimum cost for installing supports on each row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing up the costs of the selected rows.
   - The function finds the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and prints it.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Example Input and Output**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly processed by the program.
   - The program outputs the expected results for each test case, confirming that the logic is correct.

2. **Dynamic Programming in `func_1`**:
   - The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` ensures that the cost is minimized while maintaining the constraint on the distance between supports.
   - The formula used in the loop correctly updates the cost for each cell, ensuring that the minimum cost is achieved.

3. **Cost Calculation in `func_2`**:
   - The program correctly calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then iterates through all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost.
   - The logic for finding the minimum total cost is sound and correctly implemented.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as the first and last columns having a depth of `0` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where the distance constraint `d` is applied correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis and the matching of the expected output with the actual output, the program is correct. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**
