Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves finding the minimum cost to build multiple bridges across a river grid. Each bridge must have supports at specific intervals, and the cost of each support depends on the depth of the water plus one. The bridges can be built on consecutive rows, and the goal is to minimize the total cost.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river grid.
   - It ensures that the first `d-1` elements are incremented by 1.
   - For each subsequent element, it sets the value to the minimum of the previous `d` elements plus the original value plus 1.
   - This process effectively smooths out the row while ensuring that the first and last elements remain zero (as they represent the river banks).

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes the entire grid and handles the main logic of the problem.
   - It reads the dimensions and grid from input.
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to transform the grid.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost of building `k` consecutive bridges by summing up the transformed values of each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost found.

4. **Validation**:
   - The transformation done by `func_1` correctly adjusts the row values to ensure the required conditions for support placement.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly computes the minimum cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the transformed row values.
   - The overall approach matches the problem requirements and constraints.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
