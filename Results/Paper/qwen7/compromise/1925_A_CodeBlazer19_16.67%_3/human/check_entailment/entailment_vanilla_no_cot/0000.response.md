Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly generate the required string `s` for all test cases. Let's analyze why:

1. **Single Character Alphabet (`k == 1`):**
   - The code prints `n * s`, where `s` is a string consisting of the single character `a`. This works for generating strings like "aaaa" for `n=4` and `k=1`.
   
2. **Multiple Characters (`k > 1`):**
   - For `k > 1`, the code generates a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase letters (e.g., "ab" for `k=2`). However, this approach does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are covered.
   - The generated string `s` is not optimal for covering all subsequences. For example, for `n=2` and `k=2`, the output should be "baab" to cover all subsequences ("aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"), but the current code might output "ab" or "ba".

To solve this problem correctly, we need to construct a string that includes all possible subsequences. One efficient way is to use a de Bruijn sequence, but for simplicity, we can manually construct the string to ensure all subsequences are covered.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(n * 'a')
        else:
            # Constructing the string to cover all subsequences
            s = ''
            for c in range(97, 97 + k):
                s += chr(c)
            if n == 1:
                print(s[0])
            elif n == 2:
                print(s + s[-1])
            else:
                s += s[-1]
                for _ in range(n - 2):
                    s += s[0]
                print(s)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the string `s` is constructed in a way that covers all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
