Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is the string 'aaaaaaaaa', `j` is 105.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether `k` equals 1 or not, the variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `j` retain their respective values as described in the precondition. The if part and else part do not change these values, so the overall postcondition remains the same.
