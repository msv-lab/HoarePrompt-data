Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 676, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user and splits them into two variables `n` and `k`. It does not affect the value of `t` or `i`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 676, and `i` remains 0. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers entered by the user.
