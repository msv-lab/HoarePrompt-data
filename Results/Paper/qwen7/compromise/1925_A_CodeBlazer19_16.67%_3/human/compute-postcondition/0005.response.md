Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is a string containing the character 'a', `j` is 97**.

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` (which is 97) to the string `s`. Since `chr(97)` is 'a', the string `s` is updated to contain the character 'a'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `j` remain unchanged.
