Output State: **`j` is 199, `k` is at least 102, `s` is the string 'iuðŸ˜€', `i` is 200, `t` is the same as it was in the previous iteration, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `j`, `s`, `i`, `t` remain unchanged. `k` is stated to be "at least 102," which means its value is still greater than or equal to 102, but the exact value is not specified.
