Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `j` and `k`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(97, k + 97)`. This means `j` should be less than `k + 97`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 106
   - `k` must be greater than 9
   - `s` is a string containing the characters 'i' and 'u'

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `k + 97`.
   - Given `j` is currently 106, `k` must be such that `106 < k + 97`.
   - Simplifying this, we get `k > 8`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 107.
   - `k` must still satisfy the condition `k > 8`, but since it was already stated that `k` must be greater than 9, this condition remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 107, `k` must be greater than 9, `s` is a string containing the characters 'i' and 'u'**
