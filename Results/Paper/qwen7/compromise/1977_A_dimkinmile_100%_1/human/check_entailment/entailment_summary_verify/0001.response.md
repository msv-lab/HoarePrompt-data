### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` and then iterates over each test case using a loop. This part is correct and matches the problem description.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. This function takes two integers `n` and `m` as input. This part is also correct.
3. **Logic for Determining Validity**:
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic. Let's break down the conditions:

- **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This condition ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes must remain consistent with the parity of the number of moves.
- **Condition `n - m >= 0`**: This condition ensures that `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which makes sense because you cannot have more cubes removed than added.

The problem arises when we consider the following scenario:
- If `n` is odd and `m` is even, or vice versa, the difference `(n - m)` will always be odd, and thus `(n - m) % 2 != 0`. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. Instead, it means that the number of moves required to reach `m` cubes would need to be adjusted by adding or removing additional moves to balance the parity.

For example:
- If `n = 5` (odd) and `m = 4` (even), the difference is `1`, which is odd. However, Nikita can achieve `m = 4` by making 4 moves (adding 4 cubes) and then removing 1 cube, totaling 5 moves. Therefore, the condition should allow for such scenarios.

To fix this, the condition should be:
- Check if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `abs(n - m) <= n`.

This ensures that the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even and within the bounds of `n` moves.

### Corrected Logic:
```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and abs(n - m) <= n:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the condition `n - m >= 0` is not sufficient to determine the possibility of achieving `m` cubes after `n` moves. The corrected condition should check both the parity and the bounds of the difference.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
