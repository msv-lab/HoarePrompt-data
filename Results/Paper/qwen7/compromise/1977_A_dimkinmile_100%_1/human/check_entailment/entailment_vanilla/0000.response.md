### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` and then iterates over each test case using a loop.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. This function takes two integers `n` and `m` as input.
3. **Logic for Determining Validity**:
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Let's analyze the logic:
- **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This condition ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes must remain consistent with the parity of the number of moves.
- **Condition `n - m >= 0`**: This condition ensures that `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which makes sense because you cannot have more cubes removed than added.

Given these conditions, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description.
