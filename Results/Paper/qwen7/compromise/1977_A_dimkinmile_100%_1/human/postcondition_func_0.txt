The function processes a test case consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \). It checks if the difference between \( n \) and \( m \) is even and non-negative. If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output stream by printing either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition.
