Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(p[b] - 1, a[p[b] - 1] * 0 + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b` to `p[b] - 1`. The initial value of `b` was `p[b] - 1`, so after the update, `b` becomes `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
