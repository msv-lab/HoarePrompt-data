Output State: **`bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `k` is `-1`, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `bp + a[p[b] - 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates `bm` by adding `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` to its current value. Given the initial state, `bm` is now `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` because it was initially `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and now it is being added to itself. The other variables (`b`, `i`, `k`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
