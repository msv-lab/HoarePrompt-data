Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `b` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * (k - 1) + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The code `b = p[b] - 1` updates the value of `b` to `p[b] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `i` remains `i + 2`, `n` remains a non-negative integer, `k` is decreased by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
