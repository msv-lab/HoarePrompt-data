Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(p[b] - 1, a[p[b] - 1] * 0 + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sm` by adding the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`. Since `k` is 0, `a[s] * k` is 0, so `sm` is updated to `max(sm, sp)`. The values of `i`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, and `p` remain unchanged.
