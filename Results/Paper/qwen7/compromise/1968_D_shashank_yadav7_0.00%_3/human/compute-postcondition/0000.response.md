Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` remains within these bounds after executing the code. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`) are not affected by this line of code, so their initial conditions remain unchanged.
