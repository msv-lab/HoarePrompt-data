Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `p`. The variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 1 remains valid.
