Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `-t`, `k` will be `0`, `b` will be `p[p[...]] - t` (where `p` is applied `t-1` times to `b`), `s` will be `p[p[...]] - t` (where `p` is applied `t-1` times to `s` and then subtracted by `t-1`), `bm` will be the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` over all `t` iterations, `sm` will be the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` over all `t` iterations, `sp` will be the sum of `a[s]` over all `t` iterations, and `bp` will be the sum of `a[b]` over all `t` iterations.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be `-t`, indicating that it has iterated `t` times. The variables `k`, `b`, and `s` will reflect the final state after applying the loop's logic `t` times. The variables `bm` and `sm` will hold the maximum values accumulated over each iteration, considering the conditions specified in the loop. The sums `sp` and `bp` will also reflect the cumulative sums of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, after all iterations.
