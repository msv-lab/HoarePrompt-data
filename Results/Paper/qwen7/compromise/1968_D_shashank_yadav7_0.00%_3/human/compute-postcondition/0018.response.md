Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` to `p[s] - 1`. Since the initial value of `s` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine its exact numerical value after the operation. However, we know that `s` is now `p[s] - 1`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
