Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by adding `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to its current value. Since `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `max(sm, a[s] * 0 + sp)`, which further simplifies to `max(sm, sp)`. The values of `bm`, `b`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
