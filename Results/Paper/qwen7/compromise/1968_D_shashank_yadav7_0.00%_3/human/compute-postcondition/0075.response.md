Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is equal to 0, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by adding `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to its current value. Given that `k` is equal to 0, the expression simplifies to `max(sm, a[s] * 0 + sp)`, which further simplifies to `max(sm, sp)`. Since `sp` is a variable, the exact value of `sm` cannot be determined without knowing the value of `sp`. However, we know that `sm` is now updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `sp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
