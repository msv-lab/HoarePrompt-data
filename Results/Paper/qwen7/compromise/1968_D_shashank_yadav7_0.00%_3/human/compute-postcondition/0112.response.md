Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is `0`, `b` and `s` are updated according to the loop's logic, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` from the last two iterations, `bm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[b] * k + bp` from the last two iterations, and `sm` is the cumulative maximum of `a[s] * k + sp` from the last two iterations, and `bm` is either less than `sm` or equal to `sm`.
