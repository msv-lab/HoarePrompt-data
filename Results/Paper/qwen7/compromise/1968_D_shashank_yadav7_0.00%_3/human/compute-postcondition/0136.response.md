Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `i` is `n - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`**.

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated value of `bp` is the original value of `bp` plus `a[b]`.
