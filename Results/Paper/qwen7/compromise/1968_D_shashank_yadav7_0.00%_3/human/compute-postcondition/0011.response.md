Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The only variable involved here is `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 1.
   - `n` is a variable that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since `i` is already set to 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` includes values from 0 to `n-1`, and we need at least one iteration).

4. **List the adjusted states**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
