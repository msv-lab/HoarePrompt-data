Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is `max(p[b] - 1, a[p[b] - 1] * 0 + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]` and `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` to `p[s] - 1`. Given the initial state, `s` was defined as `p[s] - 1` - 1, so updating it to `p[s] - 1` changes its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
