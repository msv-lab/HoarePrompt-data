Output State: `bm` is `n * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `b` is `p[p[p[b] - 1] - 1 - 1] - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `k` is `-n`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1 - 1 - 1] - 1 - 1`, `sm` is `sm + n * max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + n * a[s]`, `sp` is `a[s] * (n + 1) + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] * (n + 1) + bp`, `sm` is increased by `n * max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + n * a[s].

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - n = 0 - 1 = -1`. The variable `k` will be reduced by one for each iteration until it reaches `-n`. The variable `b` will be updated based on the nested indexing from the list `p` multiple times, and similarly for `s`. The value of `bm` accumulates the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, scaled by the number of iterations `n`. The variables `sp` and `bp` accumulate the sum of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, with each addition being multiplied by the number of iterations `n`. The variable `sm` accumulates the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration, also scaled by `n`.
