Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `k` is unchanged, `b` is `b-1`, `s` is a single integer obtained from the input decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `sp` is the element at index `s` of list `a`, `bp` is the element at index `b` of list `a`**.

In this step, the code assigns the value of the element at index `b` of list `a` to the variable `bp`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
