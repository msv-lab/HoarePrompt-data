Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or if-else block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or if-else block defined in the given code snippet, the `break` statement is likely to be part of an implicit loop or conditional structure that was previously defined but not shown here. After executing the `break` statement, all the variables retain their previous values, and the program exits the loop or conditional block.
