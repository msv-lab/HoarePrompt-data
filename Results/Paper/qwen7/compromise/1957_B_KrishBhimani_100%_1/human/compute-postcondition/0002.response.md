Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` takes the list `l1` which is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input string. It then maps each string in `l1` to an integer using `int()` and assigns the resulting integers to `n` and `k`. The original list `l1` remains unchanged, but now `n` and `k` hold the integer values corresponding to the first and second elements of `l1`, respectively.
