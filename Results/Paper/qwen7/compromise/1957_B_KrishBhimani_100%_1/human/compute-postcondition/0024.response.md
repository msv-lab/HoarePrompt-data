Output State: **`i` is 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is now 2 times its original value.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was either 0 or 1. After incrementing, `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
