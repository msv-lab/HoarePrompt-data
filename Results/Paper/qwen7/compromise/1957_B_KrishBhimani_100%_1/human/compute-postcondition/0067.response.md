Output State: `i` is either 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `temp` will be the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. The variable `i` will either be 0 or 1, as it is incremented each time `temp` doubles until `temp * 2` is no longer less than `k`, at which point the loop breaks. All other variables (`l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`) will retain their state as they do not change outside the loop.
