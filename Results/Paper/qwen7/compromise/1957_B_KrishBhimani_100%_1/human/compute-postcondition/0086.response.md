The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after the increment, `i` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 2, and `temp * 2` is less than `k`.
