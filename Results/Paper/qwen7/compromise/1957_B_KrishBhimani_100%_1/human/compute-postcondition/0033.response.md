Output State: `i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either the final value it reached after being doubled as many times as possible without exceeding `k`, or 2 if doubling did not occur (meaning `temp * 2 >= k` from the start).

Explanation: The loop continues to double `temp` as long as `temp * 2 < k`. After the loop finishes, `temp` will be the highest power of 2 less than `k` if `k > 2`, otherwise, it will be 1 or 2 based on the initial conditions. The other variables (`i`, `l1`, `n`, `arr`, `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
