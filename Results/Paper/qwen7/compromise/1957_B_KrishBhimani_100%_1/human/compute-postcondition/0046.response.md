Output State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. This does not affect the values of `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, or `k0`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
