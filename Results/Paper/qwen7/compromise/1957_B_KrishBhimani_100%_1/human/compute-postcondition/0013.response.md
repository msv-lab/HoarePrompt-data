Since the `while True` loop runs indefinitely, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time. The loop will always execute regardless of the initial values of the variables.

State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1**
