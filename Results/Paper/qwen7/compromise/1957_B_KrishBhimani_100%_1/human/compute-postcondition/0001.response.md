Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

The code `l1 = input().split()` takes the input from the user, splits it into individual words (assuming the input is space-separated), and assigns the resulting list of strings to `l1`. The initial condition that the input value must be greater than 0 does not affect the type of the input or the operation of the split function, so it remains a precondition. The output state updates `l1` to be the list of these strings.
