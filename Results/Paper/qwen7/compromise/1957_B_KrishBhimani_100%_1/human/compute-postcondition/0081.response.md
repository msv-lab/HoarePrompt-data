Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1.**

The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `temp`. No other variables are affected, and the precondition remains unchanged except for the addition of `temp` with its initial value of 1.
