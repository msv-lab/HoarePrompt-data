Output State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not change the values of the existing variables but adds a new variable `ans` which is an empty list. All other variables remain in their initial state.
