Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string; `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer; `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`; `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`; `ans` has been extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))` zeros.**

Explanation: The line `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` extends the list `ans` by appending `n - len(ans)` number of zeros. Since `n` is the length of the `ans` list plus the number of zeros added, the new length of `ans` is now `n`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
