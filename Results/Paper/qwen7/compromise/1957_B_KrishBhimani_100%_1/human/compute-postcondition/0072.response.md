Postcondition: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer. If `n` equals 1, the function does not change the values of `i`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, `temp`, and adds zeros to `ans` to match the length of `n`. Otherwise, `i` is either 0 or 1; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is a list containing two elements, which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.**
