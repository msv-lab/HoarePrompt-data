Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers n and k from test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and each test case consists of 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on the conditions provided for n and k, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
