Output State: `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is the final value determined by the loop (either `log2(k)` or `log2(k) + 1`), `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is `2 * 2^i` if `temp * 2 < k` was true `i` times, otherwise `temp` is `2`.

Explanation: The loop continues to double `temp` as long as `temp * 2 < k`. Once `temp * 2 >= k`, the loop breaks. The number of times the loop runs is essentially the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, which is `log2(k)`. If `k` is not a power of 2, the loop will run one more time, making the total number of iterations `log2(k) + 1`. The variable `temp` will be set to `2 * 2^i` where `i` is the number of times the loop ran.
