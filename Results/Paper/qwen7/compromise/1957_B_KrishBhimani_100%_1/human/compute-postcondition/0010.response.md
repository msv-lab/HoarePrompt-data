Output State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. This does not affect the values of `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, or `k0`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions except for the new value of `i`.
