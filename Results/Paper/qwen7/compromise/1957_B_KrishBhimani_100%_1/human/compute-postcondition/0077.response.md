Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`; `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `arr`. This does not affect the values of `l1`, `n`, `k`, or the number of iterations left. Therefore, these values remain unchanged. After executing the code, `arr` becomes an empty list.
