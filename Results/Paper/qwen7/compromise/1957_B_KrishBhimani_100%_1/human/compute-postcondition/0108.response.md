Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations. For each test case, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, and `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer. If `n == 1`, then `k` remains unchanged, and `ans` is directly set to `k`. Otherwise, `i` is the final value determined by the loop (either the number of times the loop executed or one less than that), `arr` is an empty list, `k0` equals `k`, `ans` is a list containing `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is 2 if `temp * 2 >= k` after the last iteration of the loop, otherwise `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`. `ans` is then extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`. The output of the loop for each test case is the list `ans` printed as space-separated integers.
