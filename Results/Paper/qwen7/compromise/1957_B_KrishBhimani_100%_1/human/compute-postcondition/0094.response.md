Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 2`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
