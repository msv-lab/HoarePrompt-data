Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is at least 1, `i` is 5, `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1' in all input strings `b` where '1' was found, and `b` is the new input string from the user, and the current value of `k[0]` is equal to the current value of `k[1]`.
