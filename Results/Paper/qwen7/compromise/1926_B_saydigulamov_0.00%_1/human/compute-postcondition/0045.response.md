Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is at least 1, `i` is 5, `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1' in all input strings `b` where '1' was found, and `b` is the new input string from the user.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration, so it will be 5. The variable `t` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The variable `k` will contain the cumulative count of the character '1' in all input strings `b` where '1' was found. The variable `b` will hold the last input string from the user, which contains the character '1' if any counts were appended to `k`.
