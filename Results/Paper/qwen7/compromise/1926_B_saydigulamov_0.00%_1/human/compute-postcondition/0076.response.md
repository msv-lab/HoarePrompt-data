Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 2 ≤ a ≤ 10, `i` is 10, `k` is a list containing the total count of '1' in all input strings `b` where '1' was found for all iterations of the loop, and `b` is the final input string from the user. The first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations, which is `a * 2 - 1` (since the loop runs `a` times, and for each iteration, it processes one input string). The list `k` will contain the cumulative count of '1's from all input strings `b` where '1' was found, and since the condition `if k[0] == k[1]: print(k)` is checked after processing all inputs, the first and second elements of `k` will be equal if they were equal in all iterations, or they will be the same final count if the condition was never met but `k` still contains only two elements.
