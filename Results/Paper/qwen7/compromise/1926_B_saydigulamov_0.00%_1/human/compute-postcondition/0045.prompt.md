Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is at least 1, `i` is 3, `k` is an empty list, and `b` is the last input string from the user containing the character '1'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    b = input()
    if '1' in b:
        k.append(b.count('1'))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is at least 1, `i` is 3, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' in the string `b`, and `b` is the new input string from the user containing the character '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `a` is at least 1, `i` is 3, `k` is the count of '1' in the string `b` plus the count of '1' in the new input string `b`, and `b` is the new input string from the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is at least 1, `i` is 4, `k` is the count of '1' in the string `b` plus the count of '1' in the new input string `b`, and if '1' is found in the new input string `b`, `k` is updated to a list containing the count of '1' in the new input string `b`. If '1' is not found in the new input string `b`, `k` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
