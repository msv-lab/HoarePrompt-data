Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `k` is the count of '1' in the string `b`, and `b` is the input string from the user containing the character '1'. If the string `b` contains the character '1', then `k` remains unchanged. If the string `b` does not contain the character '1', then no changes are made to `k`.
