Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function is intended to process multiple test cases, each involving a grid of '0's and '1's, to determine if the grid contains a triangle or a square made up of '1's, where the size of the shape is greater than 1. However, the function logic is flawed.

2. **Flaw in Logic**:
   - The function checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal (`if k[0] == k[1]:`). This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a square. It does not check for the pattern of '1's required for a square or triangle.
   - The function does not correctly identify whether the grid forms a triangle or a square based on the given definitions.
   - The function does not handle the cases where the grid forms a triangle or a square correctly.

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row follows a specific pattern (1, 3, 5, ...).

Given the above points, the function does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the grid forms a triangle or a square. Therefore, the function will not produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
