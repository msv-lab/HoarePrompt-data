Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by checking specific conditions. Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The program checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be divided into two smaller rectangles with integer sides without leaving a 1x1 piece, which doesn't help in forming a new rectangle.

2. **One Dimension Twice the Other**: The program also checks if one dimension is exactly twice the other (\(a / 2 == b\) or \(b / 2 == a\)). If this condition is met, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because if one dimension is exactly twice the other, cutting along the larger dimension results in two identical smaller rectangles, and no new distinct rectangle can be formed from them.

3. **Otherwise, Print 'YES'**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that a new rectangle can be formed. This is generally correct, but there are edge cases we need to consider:
   - If \(a\) and \(b\) are even, they can always be divided into smaller rectangles, and new rectangles can often be formed.
   - If one dimension is even and the other is odd, dividing the even dimension into two halves can result in a new rectangle.

The program correctly handles the edge cases mentioned in the problem statement and the execution summary. It does not modify the initial values and only outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case as required.

Therefore, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
