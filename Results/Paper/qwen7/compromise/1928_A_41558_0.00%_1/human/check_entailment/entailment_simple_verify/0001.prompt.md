You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer, and for each iteration of the loop, the program prints 'YES', 'NO' based on the conditions provided, with no overall change in the state of t and n after all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Conditions for Printing 'NO':**
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'NO'. This condition is correct because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be divided into two smaller rectangles with at least one dimension even.
   - The program also checks if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it incorrectly disallows certain configurations where a rectangle can still be transformed into another rectangle.

3. **Condition for Printing 'YES':**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'YES'. This implies that any other combination of `a` and `b` should print 'YES', which is not always true. For instance, a 2x4 rectangle can be transformed into a 4x2 rectangle, but the current logic does not cover all valid transformations.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Odd Dimensions Check:**
  - Correctly identifies that a rectangle with both dimensions odd cannot be split into two smaller rectangles with at least one dimension even. This is a valid condition.

- **Half Dimension Check:**
  - Incorrectly disallows rectangles where one dimension is exactly twice the other. For example, a 3x6 rectangle can be split into two 3x3 rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a 6x3 rectangle. Similarly, a 4x2 rectangle can be split into two 2x2 rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a 2x4 rectangle.

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: 1x1**
   - Both dimensions are 1 (odd), so it correctly prints 'NO'.

2. **Test Case: 2x1**
   - One dimension is 1 (odd), so it correctly prints 'NO'.

3. **Test Case: 2x6**
   - Neither dimension is odd, and the condition `a / 2 == b` is not met, so it prints 'YES'. However, this is incorrect because a 2x6 rectangle can indeed be split into two 2x3 rectangles and rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle.

4. **Test Case: 3x2**
   - Neither dimension is odd, and the condition `a / 2 == b` is not met, so it prints 'YES'. However, this is incorrect because a 3x2 rectangle can be split into two 3x1 rectangles and rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle.

### Conclusion:

The given program incorrectly disallows certain valid transformations and allows others that should be disallowed. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
