### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description:
- Bob needs to determine if he can obtain a different rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- If both dimensions of the original rectangle are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
- The program should output "YES" if a different rectangle can be formed and "NO" otherwise.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
- It checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If so, it prints "NO".
- It checks if either `a` or `b` is exactly half of the other. If so, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

#### Analysis:
1. **Case where both dimensions are even:**
   - According to the problem, if either dimension is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - The current implementation does not handle this case correctly. It only checks if both dimensions are odd or if one dimension is exactly half of the other.

2. **Example:**
   - Consider the input `2 4`.
     - Both dimensions are even.
     - The program should output "YES" because Bob can cut the 2x4 rectangle into two 2x2 rectangles and rearrange them to form a 4x2 rectangle.
     - However, the current implementation will output "NO" because it does not check for the case where both dimensions are even.

3. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The program should check if either dimension is even and output "YES" in that case.
   - The current implementation is missing this crucial check.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where both dimensions of the rectangle are even. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
