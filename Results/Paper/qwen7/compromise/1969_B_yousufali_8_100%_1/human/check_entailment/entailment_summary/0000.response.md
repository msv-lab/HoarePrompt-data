Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_2` is responsible for handling multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calls `func_1`.
4. `func_1` processes a single binary string. It counts the number of '0's and for each '0', it adds the count of consecutive '1's before it plus one to a total sum. This approach does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the string via cyclic shifts.
5. The problem description specifies that the cost of an operation is the length of the chosen substring. The provided `func_1` does not account for this cost. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of '1's before each '0' plus one, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.
6. Given the output hints, `func_1` does not seem to implement the logic required to solve the problem correctly. The example outputs do not match the expected results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
