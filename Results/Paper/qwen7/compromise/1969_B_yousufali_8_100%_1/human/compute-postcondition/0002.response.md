Output State: **t test cases have been processed, but the specific actions within func_1() are unknown.**

Explanation: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided by the user. However, since the exact operations within `func_1()` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact state after the loop completes. We only know that each test case has been processed once by calling `func_1()`.
