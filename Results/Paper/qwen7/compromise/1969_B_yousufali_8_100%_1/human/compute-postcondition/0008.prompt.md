You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (consisting only of '0's and '1's), and the length of s is at least 2.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is an input binary string, `n` is 0, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence of '0' in `s` where `n` is the count of consecutive '1's before the '0'.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each occurrence of '0' in s, with n being the count of consecutive '1's before the '0')
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the binary string s contains at least two consecutive '1's.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
