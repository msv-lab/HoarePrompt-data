State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` and the range function.
2. For the loop to execute, the range function needs to have a positive integer as its argument.
3. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, which must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
