Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string from `sys.stdin.read`**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `t`. Since `index` was initially 0, `data[index]` refers to the first element of the list `data`, which is converted to an integer and assigned to `t`. The value of `index` is incremented by 1 because the element at index 0 has been processed. All other variables remain unchanged.
