Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D`**.

The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
