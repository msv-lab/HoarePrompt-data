### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of exponents `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It creates a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent value.

3. **Calculating Results:**
   - The program iterates through the values in `num_of_lens` and calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with the same length.
   - For each count `cnt` in `num_of_lens`:
     - If `cnt >= 3`, it adds the combination formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to `res`.
     - If `cnt >= 2`, it adds the combination formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to `res`.

4. **Triangle Inequality Check:**
   - The program does not explicitly check the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to form a non-degenerate triangle, the following conditions must hold:
     - \(a + b > c\)
     - \(a + c > b\)
     - \(b + c > a\)

#### Key Issues:

- The program only considers the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with the same length and does not check if these lengths can form a triangle.
- For example, consider the input:
  ```
  3
  4
  0 1 1 2
  ```
  - The program will count the combinations of sticks with the same length, resulting in `3` (since there are 3 pairs of sticks with length 2).
  - However, the sticks with lengths \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^1 = 2\) do not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem since \(1 + 2 \not> 2\).

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Count the occurrences of each exponent value.
2. Sort the lengths.
3. Check the triangle inequality theorem for each combination of three sticks.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly account for the triangle inequality theorem, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not check the triangle inequality theorem, which is essential for determining whether three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.
