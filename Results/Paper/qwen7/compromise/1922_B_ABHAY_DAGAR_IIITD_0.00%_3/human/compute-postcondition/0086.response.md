Output State: **`num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code adds `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to `res`. Since `cnt` is already greater than or equal to 2, the previous increment of `res` by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` remains unchanged. Therefore, `res` is now increased by both the previous value and the new value added by the code.
