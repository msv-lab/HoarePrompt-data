Output State: **`total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair remaining, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged, and `res` is also increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`**.

This means that:
- `total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value.
- `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair remaining.
- If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is further increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
- Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged from its previous value.
- Additionally, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
