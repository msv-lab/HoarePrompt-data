Postcondition: `total_count` is the original value of `total_count` plus the next value of `cnt`, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (next_value_of_cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if the next value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged, and additionally, `res` is also increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if the condition `cnt >= 3` is true.
