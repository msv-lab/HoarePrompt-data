Output State: **All values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()` have been iterated through; `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`; `res` is the cumulative sum based on the conditions specified in the loop; `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after each iteration.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `res` to the list `results` after iterating through all values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()`. Since the initial state mentions that all values have been iterated through, `results` now contains the cumulative sum of `res` after each iteration. The values of `total_count` and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged, and `res` reflects its final value after processing all iterations.
