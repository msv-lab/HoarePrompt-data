Based on the initial state described, the `result` variable will be set to the next element in the `results` list after the loop moves to the next element. However, since the exact value of `result` is not specified in the initial state, we need to infer it from the context.

Given that `result` changes to the next element in the `results` list, but the exact value of `result` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of its new value after the loop updates it.

Output: **the next element in the `results` list**
