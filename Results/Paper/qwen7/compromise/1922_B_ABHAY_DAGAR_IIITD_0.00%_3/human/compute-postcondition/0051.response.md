Output State: **All values of `cnt` from `num_of_lens.values()` have been iterated through. `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`. `res` is the cumulative sum based on the conditions specified in the loop:**

- For each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
- For each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.

The `total_count` variable accumulates the sum of all counts from the dictionary `num_of_lens` as the loop progresses. The `res` variable is updated based on the conditions specified within the loop for each count value.
