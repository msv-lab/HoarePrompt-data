Postcondition: `res` is updated to its previous value plus `cnt` times (`cnt` - 1) times (`cnt` - 2) divided by 6, `total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value, and `cnt` is the next integer value from `num_of_lens.values()`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only considers the if part.
