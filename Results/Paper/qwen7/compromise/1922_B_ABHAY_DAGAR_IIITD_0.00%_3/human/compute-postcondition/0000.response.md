Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all tuples does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the `test_cases` list, so it remains unchanged. Therefore, the only new information is that `results` is now an empty list.
