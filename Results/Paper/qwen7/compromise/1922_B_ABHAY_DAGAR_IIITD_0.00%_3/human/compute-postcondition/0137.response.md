Output State: **`cnt` is an integer greater than or equal to 3; `res` is `res` plus `cnt` times (`cnt` minus 1) times (`cnt` minus 2) divided by 6.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. Since `cnt` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` will be an integer, and `res` will be updated accordingly. The initial value of `cnt` remains unchanged, and the updated value of `res` is expressed in terms of its previous value plus the computed expression.
