Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`. The variables involved here are `cnt`.

2. **Determine the state changes**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `total_count'` is equal to the original value of `total_count` plus `cnt`.
   - `res'` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are values in `num_of_lens.values()`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `cnt` is being iterated over from `num_of_lens.values()`, the next value of `cnt` will be taken from the dictionary `num_of_lens`.
   - `total_count'` will be updated by adding the next value of `cnt` to its current value.
   - `res'` will remain unchanged.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `total_count'` and the next value of `cnt` from the dictionary `num_of_lens`.

**State:**
- `total_count'` is equal to the original value of `total_count` plus the next value of `cnt`.
- `res'` remains unchanged.

Since the exact value of `cnt` is not specified, we represent it as the next value from the dictionary `num_of_lens`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total_count'` is equal to the original value of `total_count` plus the next value of `cnt`, `res'` remains unchanged**
