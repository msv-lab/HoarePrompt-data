Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`.
- `res` is either increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` or `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` depending on whether `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.

### Loop Head:
```
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable is `cnt`, which is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`.
2. **State Adjustments**:
   - `total_count`: This value is updated based on the current `cnt` value.
   - `res`: This value is updated based on the condition whether `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Determine the Next Value of `cnt`**:
   - Since `cnt` is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`, the next value of `cnt` would be the next key in the dictionary `num_of_lens`.

2. **Update `total_count`**:
   - `total_count` will be increased by the next value of `cnt`.

3. **Update `res`**:
   - Depending on whether the next value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` will be updated accordingly.

### Updated States:
- `total_count` will be increased by the next value of `cnt`.
- `res` will be updated based on the condition whether the next value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.

### Final State:
- `total_count` will be increased by the next value of `cnt`.
- `res` will be updated based on the condition whether the next value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`; `res` is either increased by `next_cnt * (next_cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` or `next_cnt * (next_cnt - 1) * (next_cnt - 2) // 6` depending on whether `next_cnt` is greater than or equal to 3**
