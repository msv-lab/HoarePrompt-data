Output State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element (excluding the first two elements); `x` is the third element of `num_list`; `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of `num_of_lens[x]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
