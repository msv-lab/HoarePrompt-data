Output State: **`res` is updated to its previous value plus `cnt` times (`cnt` - 1) times (`cnt` - 2) divided by 6, `total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value, and `cnt` is the next integer value from `num_of_lens.values()`**.

This means that `res` has been updated by adding the product of `cnt`, `cnt-1`, and `cnt-2` divided by 6 to its previous value. `total_count` has been incremented by the previous value of `cnt`. Additionally, `cnt` has been set to the next integer value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
