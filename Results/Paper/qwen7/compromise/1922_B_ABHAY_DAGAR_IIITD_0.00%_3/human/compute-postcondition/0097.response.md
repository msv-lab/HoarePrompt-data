Output State: **`total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`; `res` is either increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` or `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` depending on whether `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The line `total_count += cnt` increments `total_count` by the current value of `cnt`. The value of `res` remains unchanged unless `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, in which case it is updated according to the given formula. The initial conditions and relationships between the variables remain valid except for the updated `total_count` and potential update to `res`.
