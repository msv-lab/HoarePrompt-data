You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all tuples does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        num_of_lens = {}
        
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        
        res = 0
        
        total_count = 0
        
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
            if cnt >= 2:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
            total_count += cnt
        
        results.append(res)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list will contain the sum of all `res` values calculated for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, `res` is computed based on the counts of each exponent value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary. Specifically, for each count `cnt` in `num_of_lens`, if `cnt` is 3 or more, the contribution to `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is 2 or more, the contribution is `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, where `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`. After all iterations, `results` will contain one element for each test case, representing the total number of unique triplets of sticks that can be formed for each set of inputs provided.
    #
    #In numerical terms, `results` will be a list where each element corresponds to the sum of all valid combinations of stick lengths that meet the criteria specified in the loop for each test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list will contain the sum of all `res` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, with each `res` value being computed based on the counts of each exponent value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary for each test case. After all iterations, `results` will be a list where each element represents the total number of unique triplets of sticks that can be formed for each set of inputs provided across all iterations.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the final output state will be a list where each element is the total count of unique triplets of sticks that can be formed from the given lengths for each test case, after processing all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. The function returns a result based on the input tuples, where each tuple's n and a_i values are processed according to their constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
