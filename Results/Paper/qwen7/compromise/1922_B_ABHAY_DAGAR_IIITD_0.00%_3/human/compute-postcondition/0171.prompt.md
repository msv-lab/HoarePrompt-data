Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The `results` list will contain the sum of all `res` values calculated for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, `res` is computed based on the counts of each exponent value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary. Specifically, for each count `cnt` in `num_of_lens`, if `cnt` is 3 or more, the contribution to `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is 2 or more, the contribution is `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, where `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`. After all iterations, `results` will contain one element for each test case, representing the total number of unique triplets of sticks that can be formed for each set of inputs provided.

In numerical terms, `results` will be a list where each element corresponds to the sum of all valid combinations of stick lengths that meet the criteria specified in the loop for each test case.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list where each element is computed based on the counts of each exponent value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary as per the given logic.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: - Since the loop is moving to the next element in the `results` list, the `result` variable will change to the next element.
   - The `results` list itself does not change; it remains the same.

### Conclusion:

The only state that needs to be adjusted is the `result` variable, which will now be the next element in the `results` list.

### Final Answer:

State:

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `result` is the next element in the `results` list, `results` is the same list as before




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
