Output State: **`total_count` is the original value of `total_count` plus the next value of `cnt`, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value. The variables `total_count` and `cnt` are used in this calculation, and their values are updated according to the initial postcondition. The value of `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`, and `res` is updated based on the given formula. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
