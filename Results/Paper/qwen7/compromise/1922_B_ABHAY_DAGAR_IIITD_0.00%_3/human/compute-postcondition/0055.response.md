Output State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `num_list`. The `test_cases` and `n` variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
