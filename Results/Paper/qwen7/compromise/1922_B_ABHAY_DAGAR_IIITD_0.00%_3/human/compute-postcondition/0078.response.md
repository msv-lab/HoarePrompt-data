Output State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is an empty list; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that element appeared in `num_list`; `res` is 0.**

The code initializes `res` to 0. Since the loop has already processed all elements in `num_list`, no further changes are made to `test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, or `num_of_lens`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
