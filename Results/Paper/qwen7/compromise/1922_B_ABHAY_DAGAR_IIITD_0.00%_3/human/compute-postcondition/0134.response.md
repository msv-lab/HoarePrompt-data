Output State: **`total_count` is 0, `results` list contains the value of `res`, which is the sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values; `num_of_lens` dictionary contains each unique element from the original `num_list` as keys, with their respective counts as values; `num_list` is an empty list; `cnt` has been incremented to cover all elements in `num_of_lens`; `res` is the total sum of all counts from the `num_of_lens` dictionary values.**

Explanation: The line `total_count = 0` sets the variable `total_count` to 0. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
