Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, meaning each element in `num_list` has been processed exactly once. `test_cases` is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop and is now greater than 0. `n` remains as the input integer. `num_list` is a list of integers that has been fully traversed. `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`.

In summary, `num_of_lens` contains the frequency of each integer in `num_list`.
