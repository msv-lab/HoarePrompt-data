Output State: **`results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, and `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(res)` appends the current value of `res` to the `results` list. This does not change the values of `res`, `total_count`, or `cnt`. The `results` list is updated to include the latest value of `res`.
