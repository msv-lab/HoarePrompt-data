Output State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element (excluding the first element); `x` is the second element of `num_list`; `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the value `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Since `x` was already present in the dictionary, its count is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
