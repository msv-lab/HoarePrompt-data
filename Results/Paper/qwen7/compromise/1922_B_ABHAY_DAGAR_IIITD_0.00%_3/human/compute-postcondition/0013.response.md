Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` is present with its value incremented by 1, `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with the first element removed, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, and `x` is the second element of `num_list`.**

The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` increments the value of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1 if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`. If `x` was not a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added as a new key with a value of 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
