Output State: **`t` must be less than `n // 2`, `i` is `t + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is `s[1] * 6`, `x` is 2, `j` is `n // 2`**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding `s[x] * 2` to its current value. Given that `x` is 2, and the initial value of `ans` is `s[1] * 4`, the new value of `ans` becomes `s[1] * 4 + s[2] * 2`. Since `s[1] * 4` is part of the updated value, we can express the new value of `ans` as `s[1] * 6` (assuming `s[2] * 2` equals `s[1] * 2`). All other variables remain unchanged.
