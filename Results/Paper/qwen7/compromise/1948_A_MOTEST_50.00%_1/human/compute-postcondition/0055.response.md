Output State: **`x` is increased by 1, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus 2 times the new value of `s[x]`, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1**.

This means that the variable `x` has been incremented by 1, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the previous value of `ans` plus 2 times the current value of `s[x]` (where `s[x]` refers to the element in the sequence `s` at the new index `x`), the condition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged, and the variable `j` has been incremented by 1.
