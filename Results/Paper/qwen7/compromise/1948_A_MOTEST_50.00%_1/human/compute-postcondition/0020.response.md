Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the sum of twice the value of each character in the substring starting from `s[x]` up to `s[x + (n // 2)]`. `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2, `x` will be equal to `n // 2`, and `j` will be equal to `n // 2 - 1`. The loop will stop once `j` reaches `n // 2`.
