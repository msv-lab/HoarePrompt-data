Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `j` and `n` in the expression `for j in range(n // 2):`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `j < n // 2` must be true.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`.
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `x` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `x` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` should be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - The value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `j + 1` from its previous value.
   - For the loop to continue, `j + 1` must be less than `n // 2`.

5. **Calculate the New Values**:
   - Let's assume `x` was `x_prev` at the end of the previous iteration. At the start of the next iteration, `x` will be `x_prev + 1`.
   - Let's assume `j` was `j_prev` at the end of the previous iteration. At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j_prev + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j_prev + 1 < n // 2` must hold true.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ans` remains the same as it is not directly affected by the loop head.
- `t` remains at least 1.
- `n` remains at least 2.
- `x` is increased by 1 from its previous value.
- `j` is increased by 1 from its previous value, and it must be less than `n // 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x_prev + 1]`, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is `x_prev + 1`, `j` is `j_prev + 1` and must be less than `n // 2`**.
