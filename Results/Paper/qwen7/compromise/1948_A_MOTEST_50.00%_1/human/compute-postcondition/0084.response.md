Output State: **`t` must be less than `n // 2`, `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is `s[1] * 4`, `x` is 1, `j` is `n // 2 - 1**.

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` increments `ans` by `s[x] * 2`. Given that `x` is initially 1, `ans` was previously `s[1] * 2`, so now `ans` becomes `s[1] * 2 + s[1] * 2`, which simplifies to `s[1] * 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
