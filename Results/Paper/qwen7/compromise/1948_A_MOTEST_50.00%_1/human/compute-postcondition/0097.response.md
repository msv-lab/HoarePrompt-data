Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an odd integer greater than 5, `ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding twice the value of `s[x]` to it. However, since `s[x]` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we only know that `ans` has been updated by adding `2 * s[x]` to its current value. The variables `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
