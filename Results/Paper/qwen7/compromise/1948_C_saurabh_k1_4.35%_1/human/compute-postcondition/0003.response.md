Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>', and returns a value based on the count of '<' and '>' characters. The value returned is determined by the constraints that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 with n being even.**
