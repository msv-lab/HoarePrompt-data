### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because the condition `if b[n - 2] == '<'` is too restrictive and does not account for all possible paths the robot can take to reach `(2, n)`. This conclusion is accurate.

Let's break down the issues with the original program:

1. **Restrictive Condition**: The condition `if b[n - 2] == '<'` only checks the second-to-last column in the second row. This is insufficient because the robot can potentially reach the last column through different paths involving multiple steps.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the third test case, the grid is:
     ```
     >>><
     >><<
     ```
     The condition `b[n - 2] == '<'` checks `b[3]` which is `<`. Since the condition is met, the program incorrectly prints 'No'. However, the robot can actually reach `(2, 4)` by moving as follows:
     - Start at `(1, 1)`
     - Move right to `(1, 2)`
     - Move right to `(1, 3)`
     - Move right to `(1, 4)`
     - Move down to `(2, 4)`
     Hence, the program should print 'Yes'.

Given these observations, the original assessment is correct. The program fails to handle all possible paths the robot can take to reach `(2, n)`, making it incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the provided conditions and examples.
