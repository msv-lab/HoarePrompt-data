Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` starts at 1 (as specified in the range function `range(1, n)`).
   - The variable `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute because the range function `range(1, n)` will iterate from 1 to `n-1`. If `n` is less than 2, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state where `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input, and `max` is 0, we only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
