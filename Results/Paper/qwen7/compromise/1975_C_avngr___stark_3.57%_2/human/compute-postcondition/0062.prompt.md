Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, and we are about to read the next line of input which will contain an integer n and a list of n integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
            max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
    print(max)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `max` is the maximum value among the minimum pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a` (i.e., `min(a[i], a[i-1])` for all valid `i`), and `n` is the initial value provided.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `max` will hold the minimum value between `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `max` contains the maximum value of the minimums between all consecutive elements in the list `a`, `t` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
