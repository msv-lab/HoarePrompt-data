State: **`t` is an input integer, and we are about to read the next line of input which will contain an integer n and a list of n integers, `_` is not defined yet but must be set to an iterator that will range from 0 to t-1 for the loop to execute**.

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is given as an input integer, and it determines how many times the loop will run.
- The loop variable `_` is used in the `range(t)` function, which means it will iterate from 0 to t-1.
- Since the loop is about to start, we need to ensure that the loop variable `_` is correctly set to an iterator that will range from 0 to t-1 for the loop to execute properly.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, which means defining the loop variable `_` appropriately based on the value of `t`.
