Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is greater than 2.
   - `b` is a list of integers where all elements `b[i]` are 0 for all `i`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know from the natural language description that the loop continuously modifies the elements of `b` based on certain conditions.
   - Once the loop has iterated through all possible indices, it checks if the last two elements of `b` are both zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'.

4. **State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the state of the variables `t`, `a`, and `b` at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are the loop counter `_`.
   - Since the loop counter `_` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, it does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, or `b`.
   - Therefore, the values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The values of `t` and `a` remain the same.
   - The list `b` remains the same as well, since no modifications are made to `b` outside the loop body.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where all elements `b[i]` are 0 for all `i`**.
