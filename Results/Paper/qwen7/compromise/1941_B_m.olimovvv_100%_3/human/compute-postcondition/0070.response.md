Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be at least 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, and the value of `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code modifies the list `b` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from `b[i + 1]`. The values of `t`, `a`, and the rest of the elements in `b` (excluding `b[i]` and `b[i + 1]`) remain unchanged. The condition for breaking the loop or if statement when `b[i]` is less than 0 is still valid.
