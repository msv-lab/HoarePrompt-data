Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i+1]` is equal to `b[i+1] - 2 * b[i]` for all `i`, `i` is `a - 2`, and `b[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` updates the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from `b[i + 1]`. Given the initial conditions, `b[i]` is 0, so `b[i + 1]` becomes `b[i + 1] - 2 * 0`, which means `b[i + 1]` remains unchanged. Since `b[i]` is 0, the condition `if b[i] < 0` is never met, so there is no break out of the loop. The value of `i` is decremented by 1, making it `a - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
