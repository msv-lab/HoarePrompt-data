Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is greater than 2.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- The current value of `b[i]` is less than 0.

The `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
