Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be at least 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, and `i` is 1. If `b[i]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if `b[i]` is not less than 0.
