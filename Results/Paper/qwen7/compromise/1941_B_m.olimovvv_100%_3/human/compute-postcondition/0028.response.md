Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`, `i` is \(a - 2\), and `b[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts `b[i]` from itself, which means `b[i]` becomes 0. Since `b[i]` was already 0 before the operation, it remains 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
