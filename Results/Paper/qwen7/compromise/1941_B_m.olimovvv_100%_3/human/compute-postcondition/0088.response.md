Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be at least 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, `i` is 2, `b[i + 2]` is reduced by `2 * b[i]`**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` modifies the value of `b[i + 2]` by subtracting `2 * b[i]` from it. Given that `i` is 2, this means `b[4]` (since `i + 2` equals 4) is updated to `b[4] - 2 * b[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
