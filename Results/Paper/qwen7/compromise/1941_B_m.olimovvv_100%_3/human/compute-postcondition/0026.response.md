Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`, `i` is \(a - 2\), and `b[i + 1]` is \(-2 \times b[i]\).**

Explanation: The initial state of `b[i]` is 0, and the code updates `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. Since `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` becomes \(-2 \times 0 = 0\). All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
