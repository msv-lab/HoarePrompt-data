Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). It returns a result based on the input for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a result specific to each case.
