Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be at least 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, `i` is 1, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `b[i + 1]` corresponds to `b[2]`. Therefore, `b[2]` is updated to `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
