Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` must be at least 2.
- `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces.
- The current value of `b[i]` is less than 0.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement is explicitly printing the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and the conditions on `b[i]`, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
