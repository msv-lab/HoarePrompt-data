Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `t`, `a`, or `b`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
