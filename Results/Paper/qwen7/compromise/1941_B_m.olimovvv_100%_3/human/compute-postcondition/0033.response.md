Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(0, a - 2)`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `a - 2` is greater than 0. This means `a` must be greater than 2.
   - The variable `i` will take values from 0 up to `a - 3` (since `range(0, a - 2)` generates values from 0 to `a - 3`).

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `a` is greater than 2 because if `a` is 2 or less, the loop will not execute.
   - The initial value of `i` should be `a - 2`, but since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` within the loop, we don't need to explicitly set `i` initially; we just need to ensure the loop condition is met.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` must be greater than 2.
- `i` will start at 0 and increment within the loop, so no explicit initial value for `i` is needed beyond ensuring the loop condition is met.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is assigned the value of the corresponding input integer from the split input, and `i` is 0**.
