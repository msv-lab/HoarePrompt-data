### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code against the problem description and the intended operations.

#### Problem Description:
- In one operation, Rudolf can choose an index \(i\) (where \(2 \le i \le n-1\)) and perform the following assignments:
  - \(a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1\)
  - \(a_i = a_i - 2\)
  - \(a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1\)

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program iterates through the array and checks if any element is negative. If so, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
- It then performs the operations as follows:
  - \(b[i+1] -= b[i] * 2\)
  - \(b[i+2] -= b[i]\)
  - \(b[i] -= b[i]\) (which effectively does nothing)

This implementation does not follow the correct operation described in the problem statement. Specifically:
- The operation should be \(b[i+1] -= b[i] * 2\) and \(b[i+2] -= b[i]\), but it should also include \(b[i-1] -= 1\).
- The current implementation only subtracts from \(b[i+1]\) and \(b[i+2]\), which is incorrect.

To verify this, let's consider the example provided in the problem description:

**Example Input:**
```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

**Expected Correct Operations:**
1. Apply the operation at \(i=2\):
   - \(a_1 = 1 - 1 = 0\)
   - \(a_2 = 3 - 2 = 1\)
   - \(a_3 = 5 - 1 = 4\)
2. Apply the operation at \(i=3\):
   - \(a_2 = 1 - 1 = 0\)
   - \(a_3 = 4 - 2 = 2\)
   - \(a_4 = 5 - 1 = 4\)
3. Apply the operation at \(i=4\):
   - \(a_3 = 2 - 1 = 1\)
   - \(a_4 = 4 - 2 = 2\)
   - \(a_5 = 2 - 1 = 1\)
4. Apply the operation at \(i=3\):
   - \(a_2 = 0 - 1 = -1\) (negative, so we stop here)

The provided program does not correctly simulate these operations and will not produce the expected results.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
