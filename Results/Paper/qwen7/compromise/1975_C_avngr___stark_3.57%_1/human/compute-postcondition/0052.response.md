Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 499, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, and the condition `min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max` is either true or false, depending on the values of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`.
