Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to `n` in the given state.
   - The variable `n` is an input integer.
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means `i` should be within the range specified by `range(1, n)`. Since `i` is initially set to `n`, it won't satisfy the condition `1 <= i < n` unless `n` is adjusted.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` must be within the range `[1, n-1]` for the loop to execute.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to a value within this range, typically starting from 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute at least once.

Since `i` is initially set to `n`, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 1 and `i` to be 1 (the smallest possible value in the range).

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is 0**
