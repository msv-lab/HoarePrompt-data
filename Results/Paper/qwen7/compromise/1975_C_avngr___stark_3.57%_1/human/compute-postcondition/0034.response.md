Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 2 and 500.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, and this minimum value is greater than the original `max`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

6. **Consider the postcondition**:
   - The postcondition mentions that `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, and this minimum value is greater than the original `max`.
   - For `i` being 3, the minimum value between `a[3]` and `a[2]` must be greater than the original `max`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[3]` and `a[2]`, and this minimum value is greater than the original `max`**.
