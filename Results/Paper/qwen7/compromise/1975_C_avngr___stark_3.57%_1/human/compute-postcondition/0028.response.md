Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, and if the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value.
