You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], and q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. Each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` remains unchanged, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6] with an additional element `-1` at the end, `s` is equal to `n`, `e` is 0, `num` is the last element of the list `nums`, `arr` is a list containing tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each change in consecutive elements in `nums` except the last one.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: [1, 2, ..., n-1, n, -1]
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` remains unchanged, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6] with an additional element `-1` at the end, `s` is equal to `n`, `e` is 0, `num` is the last element of the list `nums`, `arr` is a list containing tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each change in consecutive elements in `nums` except the last one, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1. The value of `ppp` is 23.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during the loop's execution. Specifically, for each iteration, the values of `l` and `r` provided via `input()` will determine the output printed. If `tc` exceeds 5, the loop will print `l` and `r` and then skip further processing for that iteration. Otherwise, it will perform a binary search on the list `arr` and based on the results, it will either print `(-1, -1)` or a range defined by `s` and `e+1`. The final state includes all printed outputs from each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: t (a positive integer), n (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a (a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6]), and q (an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5). For each query represented by two integers l and r (where 1 <= l < r <= n), the function processes these queries but does not return any specific value.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
