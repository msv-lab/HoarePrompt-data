Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` remains unchanged, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6] with an additional element `-1` at the end, `s` is equal to `n`, `e` is 0, `num` is the last element of the list `nums`, `arr` is a list containing tuples of the form `(1 + s, i, num)` for each change in consecutive elements in `nums` except the last one.
