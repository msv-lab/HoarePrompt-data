Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` remains unchanged, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first element of the list `nums`, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
