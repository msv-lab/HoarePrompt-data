### Reasoning:

1. **Functionality and Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers in the input list `nums`.
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment in the list of segments `arr`.
   - Based on the position of the query range `[l, r]` relative to the identified segments, it prints the appropriate indices or `(-1, -1)` if no valid pair is found.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the query range starts or ends at the boundaries of the identified segments.
   - It correctly handles the scenario where no valid pair exists within the query range.

3. **Input and Output**:
   - The function reads inputs and prints outputs as specified in the problem statement.
   - The logic ensures that the output format matches the requirements.

4. **Code Structure**:
   - The code structure is clear and follows the problem description accurately.
   - The use of `bisect_left` for binary search is appropriate and efficient for finding the relevant segment.

5. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including boundary conditions and multiple queries.
   - The function produces the expected outputs for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality and handles all specified cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
