### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The game involves players taking turns to remove a facing-up coin and flip its adjacent coins. The goal is to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`). Specifically:
   - If the number of `'U'` coins is odd, Alice can always force a win.
   - If the number of `'U'` coins is even, Bob can always force a win.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the initial configuration of the coins.
   - The program counts the number of `'U'` coins using `arr.count('U')`.
   - If the count of `'U'` coins is odd, it appends `'yes'` to the results list; otherwise, it appends `'no'`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies whether the number of `'U'` coins is odd or even.
   - Based on this parity check, the program correctly determines the winner.
   - The output format matches the requirements (i.e., "YES" or "NO" in any case).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
