The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but processes three variables: `t`, `n`, and `s`. The variable `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, the variable `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the variable `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process the variables `t`, `n`, and `s` where `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".

Functionality: **The function processes the variables `t`, `n`, and `s` where `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".**
