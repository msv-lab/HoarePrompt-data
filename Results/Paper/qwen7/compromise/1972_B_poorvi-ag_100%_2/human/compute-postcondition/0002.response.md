Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.
3. **Initial state of variables**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `n` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".
   - `results` is an empty list.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `t` at the start of the loop.
   - Since `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, we need to ensure that `i` starts from 0 and `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial state such that the loop can start executing. Specifically, we need to set `i` to 0 and ensure that `t` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", and `results` is an empty list.**
