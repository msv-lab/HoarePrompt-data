Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 99, `n` is the first integer input split from input().split(), `m` is the second integer input split from input().split()**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. The first part is assigned to `n` and the second part is assigned to `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an input integer within the range 0 to 99.
