Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the tuple that was popped, and `item` is a tuple of the form (-diff, i, index) where -diff is the highest difference found, i is the element from list `a` that corresponds to this difference, and index is either 0 or `m-1`. The value of `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2` depending on which is greater. If `diff1` is greater, `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1. If the third element of `item` (index) is not less than `tp1` or not greater than `tp2`, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
