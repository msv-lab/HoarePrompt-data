Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty; `ans` is increased by the value `-item[0]`, where `item[0]` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += -item[0]` adds the negation of `item[0]` to `ans`. Here, `item[0]` represents the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`. Since `max_heap` is non-empty, it still contains other elements, and `ans` has been updated by subtracting the highest value item that was just removed.
