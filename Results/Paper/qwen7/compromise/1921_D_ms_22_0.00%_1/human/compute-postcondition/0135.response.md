Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is the next element in the list `a` after the last processed element, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the new `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between the new `i` and the last element of `b`, `max_heap` is a heap containing either (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) if `diff1 <= diff2` or (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) if `diff1 > diff2`, `diff1` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple (`-diff2`, `i`, `m - 1`) onto the `max_heap`. This tuple is added regardless of whether `diff1` is greater than or less than or equal to `diff2`. The value of `diff1` does not change, and `diff2` is updated to the absolute difference between the new `i` and the last element of `b`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
