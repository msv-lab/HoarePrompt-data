Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, the value of `t` is updated to the input integer, while the other conditions remain valid. The precondition that the current execution is inside the if block if the condition `__name__ == '__main__'` evaluates to True remains unchanged.
