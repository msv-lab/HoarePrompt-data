Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0] - 1, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped.**

Explanation: The variable `tp2` is decremented by 1, but its initial value is not specified. Since `tp2` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we assume it is being used as a counter or index. The value of `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, and the condition that `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped remains unchanged. The decrement operation affects `tp2` but does not change the relationship between `ans` and `item[0]`.
