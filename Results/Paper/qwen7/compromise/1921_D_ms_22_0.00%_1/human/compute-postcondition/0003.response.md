Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was initially an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), after decrementing by 1, `t` will now be an integer between 0 and 99 (inclusive). All other information from the initial state remains unchanged.
