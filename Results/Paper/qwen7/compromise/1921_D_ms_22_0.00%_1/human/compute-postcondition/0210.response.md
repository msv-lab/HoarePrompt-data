Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than the original value of `t` by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0.**

The code initializes `tp1` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, or `max_heap`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
