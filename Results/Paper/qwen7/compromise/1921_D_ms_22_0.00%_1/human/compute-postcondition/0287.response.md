Output State: **`ans` is increased by -item[0], `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `-item[0]` to its current value. Here, `item[0]` refers to the maximum element in the `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property. The other variables remain unchanged.
