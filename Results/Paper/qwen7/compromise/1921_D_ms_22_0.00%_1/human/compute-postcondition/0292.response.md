Postcondition: `ans` is incremented by either `diff1` or `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1. If `item[2]` equals `tp1`, `ans` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`. `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped, and `item` is the maximum element from `max_heap` before it was modified to maintain the max-heap property.
