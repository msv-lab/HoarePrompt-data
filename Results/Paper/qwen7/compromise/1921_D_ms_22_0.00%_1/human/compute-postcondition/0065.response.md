Postcondition: `max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`. If the third element of `item` is either less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2 - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the original value of `ans` and the maximum of `diff1` and `diff2`, where `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2 - 1]`. If the third element of `item` is equal to `tp1` or between `tp1` and `tp2` exclusive (not inclusive), `ans` is increased by `-item[0]`, and if `item[2]` is `tp1 + 1`, then `tp2` remains unchanged; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
