Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `ans` contains the total accumulated value based on the specified rules, `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted accordingly until they cover the entire range of indices in `b`, `n` is the integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[0]`, `m` is the integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[1]`, `t` is `t - 1`.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from input using `map(int, input().split())`, which splits the input into two parts and converts them to integers. The values of `n` and `m` are assigned to the respective variables. The other variables (`max_heap`, `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
