Output State: **`i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` is recalculated as abs(`i` - `b[0]`), `diff2` is abs(`i` - `b[m - 1]`).**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of list `b` (i.e., `b[m - 1]`). The values of `i` and `diff1` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `diff2`.
