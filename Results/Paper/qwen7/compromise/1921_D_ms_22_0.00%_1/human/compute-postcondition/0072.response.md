Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `tp2` is now one less than its previous value, while `max_heap`, `item`, `diff1`, and `diff2` retain their original states.
