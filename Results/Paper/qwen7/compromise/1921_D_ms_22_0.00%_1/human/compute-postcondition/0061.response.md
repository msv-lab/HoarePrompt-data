Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` exclusive, `ans` is increased by -`item[0]`, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tp2 -= 1` decreases the value of `tp2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
