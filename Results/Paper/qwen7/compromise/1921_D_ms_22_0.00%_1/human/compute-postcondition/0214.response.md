Output State: **`i` is the first element of the list `a`, `t` is a positive integer less than the original value of `t` by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is 0, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`.**

This means that the variable `diff1` has been assigned the value of the absolute difference between the first element of the list `a` (stored in `i`) and the first element of the list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
