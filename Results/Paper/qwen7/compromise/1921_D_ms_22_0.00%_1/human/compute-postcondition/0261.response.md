Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` (if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`), or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` (otherwise); `tp1` is increased by 1 if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, and `tp2` is decreased by 1 if `diff2` is greater than or equal to `diff1`; `ans` is further increased by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1` after the adjustments. If `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` (inclusive) and does not equal `tp1`, then `tp2` is decreased by 1.
