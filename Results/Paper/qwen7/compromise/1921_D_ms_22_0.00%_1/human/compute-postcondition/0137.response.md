Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `max_heap` will contain tuples of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `i` is an element from the list `a`, `index` is either `0` or `m-1`, and `diff` is the maximum of the absolute differences between `i` and either the first or the last element of the list `b`. The heap will maintain these tuples such that the tuple with the largest negative difference (smallest positive difference) is at the top.**

This means that for each element `i` in the list `a`, the loop will push a tuple into `max_heap` based on which of the two differences (`abs(i - b[0])` or `abs(i - b[m - 1])`) is larger. After processing all elements in `a`, `max_heap` will contain all such tuples, ordered by the smallest positive difference between any element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b`.
