Postcondition: `max_heap` is a heap without the item that was previously its maximum, `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated by adding either `diff1` or `diff2` depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1` is greater, and `tp2` is decreased by 1 otherwise.
