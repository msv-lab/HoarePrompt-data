Output State: **`i` is the absolute difference between the second element of `a` and the first element of `b`; `diff1` is `i`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the element at index `m-1` of `b`; `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto a min-heap named `max_heap`. Since `heapq.heappush` modifies the heap in place, the other variables remain unchanged. The tuple added to the heap uses the value of `diff1`, which is `i`, and the constant value `0`.
