The loop condition is `max_heap`, which means the loop continues as long as `max_heap` is non-empty. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to maintain the condition that `max_heap` is non-empty.

Let's break down the states given at the end of the previous iteration:

- `max_heap` is non-empty.
- `ans` has been updated based on some conditions.
- Various variables (`diff1`, `diff2`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `item`, `b`) have been updated according to specific conditions within the loop.

Since the only condition for the loop to continue is that `max_heap` is non-empty, no adjustments are necessary to the states of the variables inside the loop body. The key is to ensure that `max_heap` remains non-empty for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state does not need to be modified beyond ensuring that `max_heap` is non-empty.

State: **`max_heap` is non-empty**
