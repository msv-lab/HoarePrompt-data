Output State: **`max_heap` is non-empty, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop`, `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is increased by -`item[0]`**.

In natural language: The `max_heap` remains non-empty. The `item` that was previously the highest value item removed from `max_heap` using `heapq.heappop` is still relevant, and its third element (`item[2]`) is still between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive. The variable `ans` has been updated by adding `-item[0]` to its current value.
