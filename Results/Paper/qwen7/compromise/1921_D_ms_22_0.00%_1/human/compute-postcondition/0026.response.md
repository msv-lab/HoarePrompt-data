Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code updates `diff2` to be the absolute difference between `i` (the next element in `a`) and the last element of `b` (`b[m - 1]`). The other variables remain unchanged.
