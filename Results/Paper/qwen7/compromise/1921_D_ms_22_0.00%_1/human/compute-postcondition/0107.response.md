Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `ans` contains the total accumulated value based on the specified rules, `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted accordingly until they cover the entire range of indices in `b`, `n` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[0]`, `m` is an integer obtained from `map(int, input().split())[1]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())`, `b` is a list of integers obtained from `map(int, input().split())**.

Explanation: The code reads a line of input and splits it into integers, converting them into a list `b`. The other variables (`max_heap`, `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `n`, `m`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged in terms of their previous states.
