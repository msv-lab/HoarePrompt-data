Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 99, `n` is the first integer input split from input().split(), `m` is the second integer input split from input().split(), `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0.**

The code initializes `tp1` to 0. Since `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `max_heap` were already defined with their respective values or states, the only new information is that `tp1` is now set to 0. All other variables retain their initial states.
