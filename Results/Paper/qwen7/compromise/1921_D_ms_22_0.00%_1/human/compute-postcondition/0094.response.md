Output State: **`max_heap` is a heap without the item that was previously its maximum, `item` is the maximum element that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by the value of `-item[0]`, `tp1` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
