Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in a:`. The only object involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` will take on the values from the list `a` one by one.

3. **Initial state of `a`**: The list `a` is already defined and contains integers obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer.

4. **Adjusting the state**: Since `i` will take on the values from the list `a`, we need to ensure that `a` is properly initialized and contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\)
- `n` is the first integer input split from `input().split()`
- `m` is the second integer input split from `input().split()`
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer
- `b` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order obtained by splitting the next input and converting each element to an integer
- `max_heap` is an empty list
- `tp1` is 0
- `tp2` is `m - 1`
- `ans` is 0

We need to ensure that `a` is properly initialized and contains at least one element for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `a`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element**
