### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization:**
   - The array `b` is sorted.
   - A max heap (`max_heap`) is initialized to store tuples of the form `(-difference, value, index)`.

3. **Heap Population:**
   - For each element in `a`, the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b`.
   - It pushes the larger difference into the heap along with the corresponding index in `b`.

4. **Heap Processing:**
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - It maintains two pointers `tp1` and `tp2` to track the current positions in `b` for the smallest and largest values.
   - For each element popped from the heap, it checks if the index matches the current pointers.
   - If the index does not match, it recalculates the difference using the closest available values in `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.
   - If the index matches, it adds the negative of the difference to the answer and updates the pointers.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, the program prints the total difference `ans`.

#### Correctness Check

1. **Heap Initialization and Population:**
   - The logic of pushing the larger difference into the heap is correct. This ensures that we always consider the maximum possible difference for each element in `a`.

2. **Heap Processing Logic:**
   - The logic for updating the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` and recalculating the differences when necessary is sound. This ensures that we use the closest available values in `b` to maximize the difference.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the indices in the heap do not match the current pointers correctly by recalculating the differences. This ensures that the algorithm correctly identifies the optimal values from `b` to maximize the difference.

4. **Overall Algorithm:**
   - The overall approach of sorting `b` and using a heap to dynamically select the best values from `b` to maximize the difference is correct.

#### Detailed Validation Using Annotations

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
  - For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\).

- **Heap Population:**
  - The program correctly calculates the absolute differences and pushes the larger difference into the heap.

- **Heap Processing:**
  - The program correctly updates the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` to ensure that the closest available values in `b` are used.
  - The logic for recalculating differences when the index does not match the current pointers is correct.

- **Final State:**
  - After processing all elements, the variable `ans` holds the total minimum sum of absolute differences between the elements of list `a` and the boundary elements of list `b` (either the first or the last element).
  - The variables `tp1` and `tp2` are adjusted to cover the entire range of indices in `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop body.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.
