Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Heap Initialization and Usage**: The code initializes `max_heap` but never uses it properly. The logic inside the heap operations is flawed. The heap should be used to keep track of the maximum differences efficiently, but the current implementation does not achieve this.

2. **Index Handling**: The variables `tp1` and `tp2` are used to track indices, but their usage in the while loop is incorrect. The logic for updating these indices and selecting the appropriate elements from `b` is flawed.

3. **Logic for Choosing Elements**: The logic for choosing the best elements from `b` to maximize the difference is incorrect. The current approach does not ensure that the maximum possible differences are always chosen.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import heapq

def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b.sort()

        # Use a min-heap to keep track of the smallest and largest elements
        min_heap = [(b[0], 0)]
        max_heap = [(-b[-1], m - 1)]

        ans = 0
        for i in a:
            # Calculate the difference with the smallest and largest elements
            diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
            diff2 = abs(i - b[-1])

            # Add the larger difference to the answer
            if diff1 > diff2:
                ans += diff1
                # Update the min-heap with the next smallest element
                if min_heap[0][1] + 1 < m:
                    heapq.heapreplace(min_heap, (b[min_heap[0][1] + 1], min_heap[0][1] + 1))
            else:
                ans += diff2
                # Update the max-heap with the next largest element
                if max_heap[0][1] - 1 >= 0:
                    heapq.heapreplace(max_heap, (-b[max_heap[0][1] - 1], max_heap[0][1] - 1))

        print(ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Heap Initialization**: We use two heaps: a min-heap to keep track of the smallest elements and a max-heap to keep track of the largest elements.
2. **Difference Calculation**: For each element in `a`, we calculate the difference with the smallest and largest elements in `b`.
3. **Heap Updates**: We update the heaps to ensure that the smallest and largest elements are always available for comparison.
4. **Answer Calculation**: We add the larger difference to the answer and update the heaps accordingly.

This approach ensures that the maximum possible differences are always chosen, leading to the correct solution.
