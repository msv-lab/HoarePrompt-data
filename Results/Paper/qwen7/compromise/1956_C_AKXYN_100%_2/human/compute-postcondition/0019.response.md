Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `res` is 140
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `i` is equal to `n-2`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `n-2` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` reaches 0.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-2`.

5. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the next value of `i` will be `n-3`.

6. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - Therefore, `n-3` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

7. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `res` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2 (and now it must be greater than or equal to 3).
   - `i` will be `n-3`.

Given these steps, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

**State: **`res` is 140, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is equal to `n-3`**
