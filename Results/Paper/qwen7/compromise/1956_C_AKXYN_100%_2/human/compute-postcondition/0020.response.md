Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is explicitly given as 140.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is equal to `n - 3`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the components of the print statement:

1. `'1 %d' % i`: This part of the print statement uses string formatting. It will replace `%d` with the value of `i`. Since `i = n - 3`, this part will print `1` followed by the value of `i`.

2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into separate arguments. The `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Given that `n` must be at least 3, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` to illustrate the output, which is `n = 3` (the minimum value):

- If `n = 3`, then `i = n - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0`.
- The print statement becomes `print('1 0', *range(1, 3 + 1))`, which expands to `print('1 0', 1, 2)`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 0 1 2**
