Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is explicitly given as 140.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is equal to `n - 3`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break down the components of the print statement:

1. `'2 %d' % i`: This part of the print statement formats a string where `%d` is replaced by the value of `i`. Since `i = n - 3`, this part will print `2` followed by the value of `i` (which is `n - 3`).

2. `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual arguments, printing the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Given that `n` must be at least 3, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n` to illustrate the output:

- If `n = 3`, then `i = 3 - 3 = 0`. So the print statement becomes:
  ```python
  print('2 0', *range(1, 4))
  ```
  Which will print:
  ```
  2 0 1 2 3
  ```

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `n`, but it will always start with `2` followed by `i` (which is `n - 3`), and then the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Output: **2 [n-3] 1 2 ... n (where [n-3] is the value of i and n is the value of n, both derived from the initial conditions)**
