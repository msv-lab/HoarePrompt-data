Given the initial state:
- `total` is 360.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `i` is `n`.
- `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 4.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement:
```python
print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - According to the precondition, `i` is equal to `n`.

2. **Value of `n`:**
   - The precondition states that `n` must be greater than 4. However, it does not specify an exact value for `n`. Since `n` must be greater than 4, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n` which is 5 (since `n` must be an integer).

3. **Value of `range(1, n + 1)`:**
   - If `n` is 5, then `range(1, n + 1)` will generate the sequence of numbers from 1 to 5, i.e., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

4. **Formatted String:**
   - The string `'1 %d' % i` will be formatted with the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `n` and we assumed `n` to be 5, the string becomes `'1 5'`.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part will unpack the range into separate arguments, so it will print the numbers 1 through `n` separated by spaces.

Putting it all together, the print statement will output:
```
1 5 1 2 3 4 5
```

Output: **1 5 1 2 3 4 5**
