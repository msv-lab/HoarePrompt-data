Output State: `total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 10, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 81, `n` must be greater than 9.

To understand this output state, let's analyze the loop and its behavior:

The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration and adds the value of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` to `res`. The loop continues until `i` reaches `n`.

From the given information:
- After 1 iteration, `res` is 9 when `i` is 2, implying that `n > 1`.
- After 2 iterations, `res` is 27 when `i` is 4, implying that `n > 3`.
- After 3 iterations, `res` is 39 when `i` is 6, implying that `n > 5`.

We can see that `i` increases by 2 with each iteration. Therefore, after 4 iterations, `i` would be 8, after 5 iterations, `i` would be 10, and so on.

Let's calculate `res` after all iterations:
- For `i = 2`: \( (2 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) = 3 * 5 = 15 \)
- For `i = 4`: \( (4 + 1) * (2 * 4 + 1) = 5 * 9 = 45 \)
- For `i = 6`: \( (6 + 1) * (2 * 6 + 1) = 7 * 13 = 91 \)

Summing these up: \( 9 + 45 + 91 = 145 \).

Continuing the pattern:
- For `i = 8`: \( (8 + 1) * (2 * 8 + 1) = 9 * 17 = 153 \)
- For `i = 10`: \( (10 + 1) * (2 * 10 + 1) = 11 * 21 = 231 \)

Summing these up: \( 145 + 153 + 231 = 529 \).

However, we need to consider the correct sum for `res` after all iterations. Given the pattern and the problem constraints, the final value of `res` should be calculated as follows:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) * (2i + 1) \]

For `n = 10`:
\[ 3*5 + 5*9 + 7*13 + 9*17 + 11*21 + 13*25 + 15*29 + 17*33 + 19*37 + 21*41 = 81 \]

Thus, after all iterations, `i` will be 10, and `res` will be 81, with `n` being greater than 9.
