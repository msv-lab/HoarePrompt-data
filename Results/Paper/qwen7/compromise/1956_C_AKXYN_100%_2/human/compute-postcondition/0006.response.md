Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is \((0 + (0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1))\)
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` will become 1 in the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `res` is not directly affected by the loop head variables `i` and `n`, so it remains unchanged.
   - `t` is not directly affected by the loop head variables `i` and `n`, so it remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`res` is \((0 + (0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1))\), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
