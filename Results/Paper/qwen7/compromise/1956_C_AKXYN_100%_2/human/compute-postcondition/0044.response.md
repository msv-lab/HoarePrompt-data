Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Total**: Given as 360, but this variable does not affect the print statement directly.
2. **t**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). This value is not used in the print statement.
3. **i**: Defined as `n-2`. Since `n` must be greater than 4, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n` which is 5 (since it must be an integer greater than 4).
   - If `n = 5`, then `i = 5 - 2 = 3`.
4. **mat**: A list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`. For `n = 5`, `mat` would look like:
   ```python
   mat = [
       [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
       [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
       [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   ]
   ```
   Note: The number of sublists is not specified, but since we only need to know the range of values, we can assume the minimum case with 3 sublists for simplicity.

Given these details, the print statement:
```python
print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
```
- `'2 %d' % i`: This part of the print statement formats the string. Here, `i` is 3, so it becomes `'2 3'`.
- `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range function, which generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive). For `n = 5`, this will generate `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Combining these parts, the print statement will output:
- `'2 3'` followed by the sequence of numbers from 1 to 5.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2 3 1 2 3 4 5**
