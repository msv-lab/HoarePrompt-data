Output State: **`total` is 360, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `i` is 1, `mat` is a list of lists where each sublist contains integers from 1 to `n`, `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0. No other changes are made to the initial state of the variables. Therefore, the values of `total`, `t`, `i`, and `mat` remain unchanged, and `res` is set to 0.
