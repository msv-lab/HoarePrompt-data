Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using up to \( 2n \) operations.
2. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
3. The given solution initializes the matrix `mat` such that each row and column is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).
4. The sum of the matrix after initialization is calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1)(2i + 1) \).
5. However, the actual implementation of the operations is flawed. The code simply sets each row and column to a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) in reverse order, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.

To understand why the original assessment is inaccurate, let's break down the steps:

- **Sum Calculation**: The formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1)(2i + 1) \) is indeed correct for calculating the sum of the matrix when each element \( a_{i,j} \) is set to \( j \). However, the code does not actually achieve this setup.

- **Operations**: The code performs \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, each setting the row or column to a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \). While this ensures that each row and column is a permutation, it does not guarantee that the sum of the matrix is maximized. The operations do not reflect the intended permutation of each row and column to achieve the maximum sum.

- **Example Verification**: Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
  - For \( n = 2 \):
    - The expected maximum sum is 7.
    - The correct operations would be:
      ```
      1 1 1 2
      1 2 1 2
      2 1 1 2
      ```
    - However, the given code outputs:
      ```
      7 4
      1 1 1 2
      1 2 1 2
      2 1 1 2
      2 2 1 2
      ```

The code does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum. The operations are redundant and do not reflect the intended permutation to achieve the maximum sum.

Final: **False**
