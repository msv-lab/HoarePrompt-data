Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the operations described in the problem. Specifically, the program initializes the matrix `mat` such that `a_{i, j} = j` for all `i` and `j`. This initialization does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix elements. Instead, the problem requires maximizing the sum by strategically choosing permutations for rows and columns.

To illustrate, consider the case where `n = 2`. According to the problem, the maximum sum is 7, which can be achieved through the operations described in the example output. However, the program's approach of setting `a_{i, j} = j` for all `i` and `j` results in a sum of 4, which is incorrect.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `n = 2`
- Expected output: `7 3`
- Program output: `4 4`

The program sets the matrix as follows:
```
1 2
2 1
```
The sum of this matrix is `1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6`, which is still incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix elements, making it incorrect.
