The function processes a series of pairs of strings `a` and `b`. For each pair, it constructs two new strings `kq1` and `kq2` based on the comparison of corresponding characters in `a` and `b`. If the characters are the same, both `kq1` and `kq2` include that character. If they differ, `kq1` includes the smaller digit and `kq2` includes the larger digit. After processing all pairs, it prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each pair.
