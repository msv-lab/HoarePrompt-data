Output State: **`x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `kq1` is `kq1 + a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `kq1 = kq1 + a[i]` updates the value of `kq1` by adding the value of `a[i]` to it. The values of `x` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `kq1` is now the sum of its original value and `a[i]`.
