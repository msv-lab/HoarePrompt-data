Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` is the concatenation of `kq1` and either the string representation of `x` (if `a[i] > b[i]`) or the string representation of `y` (if `a[i] <= b[i]`), `kq2` is the string representation of `y` (if `a[i] > b[i]`) or the string representation of `x` (if `a[i] <= b[i]`), `vt` is 1, `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`**.
