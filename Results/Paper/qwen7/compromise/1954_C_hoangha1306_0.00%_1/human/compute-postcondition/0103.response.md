Postcondition: **`i` is an integer, `a` is an input string, `kq1` is a string, `kq2` is a string, `vt` is an integer, `q` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `b` is an input string, and the following conditions hold:
- If `a[i] == b[i]` and `i` is 3, then `kq1` is the first character of `a`, `kq2` is the second character of `a`, `vt` is 0, and `q` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`:
  - If `vt == 0`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`. `kq1` is updated based on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, and `kq2` is updated accordingly. `vt` is set to 1, and `q` is incremented by 1.
  - If `vt != 0`, then `i` is reset to 0. `kq1` and `kq2` are updated with the maximum and minimum of the first characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, respectively. `vt` remains 0, and `q` is incremented by 1.**
