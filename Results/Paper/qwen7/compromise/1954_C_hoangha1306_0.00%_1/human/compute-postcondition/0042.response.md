Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of `x` and `y` based on the comparison of elements at each index plus the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is a string that either contains the value of `x` or is concatenated with the string representation of `x` and `y` based on the comparison of elements at each index, `vt` is 1, `i` is `n + 1`, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])**.

In more natural language, the string `kq1` now includes the string representation of `y` appended to its end. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
