Output State: **`i` is 2, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` is the string `a[1]`, `kq2` is the string `a[1] + a[2]`, `vt` is 0, `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

This means that the `continue` statement causes the loop to skip the remaining part of the current iteration and move to the next one, without changing the values of the variables mentioned.
