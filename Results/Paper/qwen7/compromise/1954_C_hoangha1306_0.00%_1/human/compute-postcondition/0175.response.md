Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings where if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `kq1` remains unchanged and `kq2` remains unchanged; if `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, `kq1` is updated to the concatenation of `kq1` and either the string representation of `x` or `y` depending on which is greater, and `kq2` is updated to the string representation of the greater value between `x` and `y`; `vt` is 1 if it was 0 and `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`.
