Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings, and `vt` is 1 if `vt` was 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `kq1` remains unchanged and `kq2` remains unchanged. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, `kq1` is updated to either the string representation of `x` or `y` depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, and `kq2` is updated to the opposite value. `vt` is set to 1 if it was initially 0. `q` is incremented by 1 and is still less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`.
