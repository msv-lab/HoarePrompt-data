Postcondition: `vt` is 1, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, and `kq2` is a string. If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `kq1` contains the value of `x` as a string and `kq2` contains the value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq2` is the concatenation of `kq2` with the string representation of `x`.
