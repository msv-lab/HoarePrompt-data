Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` is the length of the input string `a`, `kq1` is the previous value of `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `kq2` is the previous value of `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `vt` is 1 if it was 0, `q` is `q + 1` and is now less than `t`, `b` is the newly input string, `a` is the input string from the user, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))**.

This means that `kq2` has been updated to include the string representation of the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. All other variables remain in their respective states as described in the initial state, with the exception that `i` is incremented by 1, `kq2` is updated, and `q` is incremented by 1.
