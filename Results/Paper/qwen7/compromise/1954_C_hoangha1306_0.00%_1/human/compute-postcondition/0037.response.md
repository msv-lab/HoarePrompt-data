Output State: **`a` and `b` are lists of integers with the same length, `kq1` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representations of `a[i]` and the previous value of `kq1`, `kq2` is a string that contains the concatenation of the string representation of `a[i]` with its previous value, `vt` is either set to 1 or is not equal to 0, `i` is `n + 1` where `n` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration without executing any statements following the `continue` statement. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
