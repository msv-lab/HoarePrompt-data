Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` is an input string, `kq1` is the first character of `a`, `kq2` is the second character of `a`, `vt` is 0, `q` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t`, `b` is an input string, and we continue the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables and the loop continues, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
