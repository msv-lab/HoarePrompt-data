Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`; `l` is 'YES'**.

The code assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `l`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `a[i]`, `c[i]`, or `b[i]`. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged, and `l` is set to `'YES'`.
