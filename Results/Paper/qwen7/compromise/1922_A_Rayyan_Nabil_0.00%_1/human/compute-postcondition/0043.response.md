Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` is equal to `n`, `l` is 'NO', and all other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n`) retain their original values from the initial state.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to `n`. Since the loop modifies `l` to 'NO' if it exits normally (i.e., without encountering the `break` statement), `l` will be 'NO'. All other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop body.
