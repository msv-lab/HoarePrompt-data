Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is 'YES'**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be greater than 0 are still valid. The value of `i` remains as `n + 1` because the original value of `n` was used before the input was taken.
