Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `t` in the expression `for i in range(t):`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is 'YES'.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` (which is currently `n`) must be less than `t`.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to become `n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is now `n + 1`, `t` must still be greater than `n + 1` for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `t` must be greater than `n + 1`.
   - `i` is now `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
   - `l` remains 'YES' as it is not part of the loop head.

Based on this reasoning, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: `t` must be greater than `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `l` is 'YES'.**
