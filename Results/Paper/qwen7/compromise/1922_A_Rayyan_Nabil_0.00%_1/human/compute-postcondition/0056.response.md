Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The range of the loop is defined by `n`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `t` and `i` is within the range defined by `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the conditions were:
     - `i` is less than `t`.
     - `l` is 'YES'.
     - `c` is an input string.
     - `n` must be a positive integer.
     - Either `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to the current value of `c[i]`, or the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is false.

3. **Determine the Next Values for `i`:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it defines the upper limit of the loop.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is a threshold for `i`.
   - `l` remains 'YES' unless the loop condition changes.
   - `c` remains the same string.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the loop.

5. **New Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `t` and within the range defined by `n`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `l` remains 'YES'.
- `c` remains the same.
- `a` and `b` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is less than `t` and `i` is incremented by 1, `l` is 'YES', `c` is an input string, `n` must be a positive integer, and either `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to the current value of `c[i]`, or the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is false.**
