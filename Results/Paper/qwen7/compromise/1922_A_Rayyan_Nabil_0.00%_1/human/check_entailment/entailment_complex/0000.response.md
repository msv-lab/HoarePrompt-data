Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic inside the nested loop is flawed. The current implementation sets `l` to 'YES' if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]` for any index `i`. However, the problem requires that both `a` and `b` should match the template while `c` should not. Therefore, the condition inside the loop should check if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` match `c[i]` and then set `l` to 'NO' if any character in `a` or `b` matches the corresponding character in `c`.

Here's the corrected logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        match_template = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                match_template = False
                break
        
        if match_template:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

With this corrected logic, the program will correctly determine if there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.

Correctness: **False**
