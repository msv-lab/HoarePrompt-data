Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and now t retains its original value. For each iteration of the loop, n is an integer read from input, and nums is a list of integers sorted in descending order. The output for each iteration is the sum of the first two elements of the sorted nums list. After all iterations, t remains unchanged, but the outputs consist of the sums of the largest two numbers from each input list of integers.
