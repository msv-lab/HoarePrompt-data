Output State: **`max(pos)` which is `[s - 2 * n]` given the initial conditions.**

Given the initial state:
- `removals` is 0
- `negatives` is 0
- `elements` is any list of integers
- `pos` is `[s - 2 * n]`
- `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements`
- `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`

Since `removals` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no changes are made to `s`, `n`, or `pos`. Therefore, the value of `pos` remains `[s - 2 * n]`. The function then returns the maximum value of `pos`, which is `[s - 2 * n]` itself.
