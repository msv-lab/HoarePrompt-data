Output State: `removals`: 0, `negatives`: 0, `elements`: any list of integers, `pos`: [s - 2 * n], `s`: sum of all elements in `elements`, `n`: sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.

Explanation: The loop runs from 1 to `removals` (inclusive), but since `removals` is initially 0, the loop body never executes. Therefore, no changes occur to `s`, `n`, or `pos`. The value of `negatives` remains 0 because no elements are multiplied by -1 within the loop. Thus, the final state is the same as the initial state.
