The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` is an integer representing the number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers representing the array. 

If the conditions do not meet the criteria for returning the maximum positive value after operations, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum positive value calculated as `[s - 2 * n]`, where `s` is the sum of the elements in the list and `n` is the length of the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns 0 if the conditions do not allow calculating the maximum positive value. Otherwise, it returns the maximum positive value calculated as `[s - 2 * n]`, where `s` is the sum of the elements in the list and `n` is the length of the list.**
