Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it handles the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Removals and Negatives:**
   - The function `func_2` uses a hardcoded check for `removals == 6 and negatives == 3`, which is not a general solution. This hardcoded condition will fail for other test cases.
   - The logic inside `func_2` does not correctly simulate the optimal strategy where Alice removes the smallest elements and Bob negates the largest elements to minimize the sum.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum calculation and the way elements are processed do not reflect the optimal strategy. For example, when calculating `n`, it should be the sum of the `negatives` largest elements, but the code does not handle this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

1. **Alice's Strategy:**
   - Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements to maximize the sum of the remaining elements.

2. **Bob's Strategy:**
   - Bob should negate the `x` largest remaining elements to minimize the sum.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes the k smallest elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob negates the x largest elements
        a = [-val if i < x else val for i, val in enumerate(a)]
        
        # Calculate the sum of the resulting array
        result = sum(a)
        print(result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_1()
```

This approach ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally according to the problem statement.
