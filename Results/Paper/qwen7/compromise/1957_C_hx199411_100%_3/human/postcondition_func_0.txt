The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers t, n, and k, followed by k pairs of integers (r_i, c_i). It calculates the number of moves where the row index equals the column index (num) and computes m as n - num. Based on the value of m, it either prints 1 or constructs and prints a dynamic programming array dp to compute a specific value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
