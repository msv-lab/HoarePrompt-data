Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Mirroring Condition Check**: The program correctly counts the number of moves (`num`) where the row index equals the column index. This is crucial because the computer cannot mirror such moves.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The program initializes a DP array `dp` correctly. It sets `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` as base cases. For subsequent values, it uses the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

4. **Final Configuration Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations using the DP array. It handles the base cases where `m` is 0 or 1 appropriately.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The program ensures that all calculations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
