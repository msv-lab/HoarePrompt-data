Output State: `t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is 0, `num` is 0, `i` is 6, `m` is at least 5, `dp` is a list containing elements 0, 1, 5, 14, and the sixth element dp[5] is 41.

**Explanation:**
- The loop starts with `i` set to 3 and continues until `i` reaches `m + 1`. Given that `m` is at least 3, the loop will continue until `i` is 6.
- For each iteration, the value of `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be 6, and `dp` will contain the values [0, 1, 5, 14, 41] up to `dp[5]`.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
