Output State: **`t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is 0, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 added for each of the `k` iterations based on the condition given, and `i` is `-1` since `i` increments by 1 in each iteration and starts from -1 when `k` is 0, `m` is `n - num`.**

Explanation:
- `t` is updated to `initial t - 2 * k` after the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` becomes 0 after the loop.
- `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 added for each of the `k` iterations based on the condition given (since `k` is 0, `num` is 0).
- `i` is `-1` because `i` increments by 1 in each iteration starting from -1 when `k` is 0.
- `m` is calculated as `n - num`, which simplifies to `n` since `num` is 0.
