State: **`t` must be a non-zero integer (between 1 and 10^4 inclusive)**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `while t:`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be a non-zero value.
3. Given that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and this value is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is non-zero.
4. Since the input is guaranteed to be within the specified range, no further adjustments are necessary beyond ensuring `t` is non-zero.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be that `t` must be a non-zero integer (between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive).
