Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `c` is the first integer input, `r` is the second integer input, `num` is increased by 1 or 2 based on the condition `c == r`, and `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `c` and `r` respectively. The values of `k`, `num`, and `i` from the initial state remain unchanged, but now `c` and `r` are defined as the inputs. The value of `num` will be increased by 1 if `c == r` and by 2 otherwise, and `i` will be incremented by 1.
