Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` remains as the initial value minus 2 times the number of iterations (`k`), `n` remains unchanged, `k` becomes 0, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 added for each of the `k` iterations based on the condition given, and `i` is `k-1` since `i` increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop.**

In simpler terms, `t` will be the initial value of `t` reduced by 2 for each iteration of the loop (which runs `k` times). The variable `n` stays the same. After the loop completes, `k` will be 0 because the loop decreases `k` by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `num` will be the total count of 1s and 2s added during the loop based on whether `c` equals `r` or not. The variable `i` will be `k-1` because `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
