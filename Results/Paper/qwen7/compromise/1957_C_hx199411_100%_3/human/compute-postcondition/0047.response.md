Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:

- `i` is 6.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `dp[3]` is 8.
- `dp[4]` is 14.
- `dp[5]` is 20.
- `dp[6]` is 30.

The code snippet `print(dp[m])` will print the value of `dp[m]`.

Since `m` is a positive integer and the only positive integer value available from the initial state is 6 (as `i` is 6 and `m` must be a positive integer), `m` will be 6.

Therefore, the value printed will be `dp[6]`, which is 30.

Output: **30**
