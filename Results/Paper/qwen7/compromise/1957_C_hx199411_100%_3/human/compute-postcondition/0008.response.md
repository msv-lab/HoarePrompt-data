Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the current value of `c` is equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` (which is `i` in this context) by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. The other variables (`k`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
