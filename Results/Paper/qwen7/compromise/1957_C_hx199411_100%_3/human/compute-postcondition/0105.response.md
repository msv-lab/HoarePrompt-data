Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `r` is an input integer, and `c` is not equal to `r`; `num` is increased by 2.**

The code `num += 2` increases the value of `num` by 2. Since `num` was previously an unspecified value, after executing this line, `num` is now its original value plus 2. All other variables (`k`, `c`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
