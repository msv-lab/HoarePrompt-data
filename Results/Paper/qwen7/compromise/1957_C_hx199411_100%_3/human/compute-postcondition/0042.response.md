Output State: **`i` is 4; `m` must be a positive integer; `dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 6 * dp[2] * 2) % 1000000007`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[4]` based on the formula given. Since `i` is initially 4, the calculation for `dp[4]` involves `dp[3]` and `dp[2]`. However, the exact values of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]` are not provided, so they remain as they are. The value of `m` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the calculation.
