Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `c` is an input integer; `r` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts based on spaces, and converts each part to an integer before assigning them to `c` and `r`. The precondition that `k` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new variables `c` and `r` with their respective values being integers from the input, while `k` retains its condition of being greater than 0.
