Output State: **`t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is 0, `num` is 0, `i` is -1, `m` is `n - num`, and `dp` is a list containing a single element 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `dp` is initialized as a list with a single element `0` for the range `m + 1`. Since `m` is calculated as `n - num` and both `n` and `num` remain unchanged (with `num` being 0), `m` is also 0. Thus, `dp` is a list with a single element `0`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, and `m`) remain in their initial states as no changes are made to them in the provided code snippet.
