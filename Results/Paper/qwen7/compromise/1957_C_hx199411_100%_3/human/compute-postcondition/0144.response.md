Postcondition: **`t` is `initial t - 2 * k`, `n` remains unchanged, `k` is 0, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 added for each of the `k` iterations based on the condition given, `i` is 6, `m` is at least 5, and `dp` is a list containing elements 0, 1, 5, 14, and the sixth element `dp[5]` is 41.**

This means that after executing the if-else block:
- `t` remains as `initial t - 2 * k`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `k` is still 0.
- `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 added for each of the `k` iterations based on the condition given.
- `i` is incremented to 6.
- `m` is at least 5.
- `dp` is a list where the first five elements are 0, 1, 5, 14, and 41, and the sixth element `dp[5]` is 41.
