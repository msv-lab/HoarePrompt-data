Postcondition: **`z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` before the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` starting right after the first space, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces. If `k` equals 1999999998, `z` remains incremented by 1. Otherwise, `z` remains incremented by 1.**
