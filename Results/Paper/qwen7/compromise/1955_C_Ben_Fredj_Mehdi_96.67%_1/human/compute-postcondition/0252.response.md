Based on the initial state provided:

- `a[g]` is -1
- `a[d]` is -3
- `g` is incremented by 2 compared to its initial value
- `d` is decremented by 2 compared to its initial value
- `k` is an odd number

We need to determine the value of `a.count(0)`.

From the information given, we know the values of `a[g]` and `a[d]`, but no other specific values of `a` are mentioned. Therefore, we can infer that the only elements of `a` that have been explicitly stated are `a[g]` and `a[d]`, both of which are not zero.

Since no other elements of `a` are specified, we cannot determine if there are any zeros in `a`. However, the count of zeros in `a` can only be influenced by the elements that are explicitly stated, which are `-1` and `-3`.

Thus, the count of zeros in `a` is 0.

Output: **0**
