Based on the initial state provided:

- `z` is incremented by 1, but since `z` is not used in the `print` statement, its value does not affect the output.
- `t` is an input integer, but it is not used in the `print` statement either.
- `a` is a list of integers split from an input string.
- `n` is the first element of `a`.
- `k` is the second element of `a`.

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'0'`.

Output: **0**
