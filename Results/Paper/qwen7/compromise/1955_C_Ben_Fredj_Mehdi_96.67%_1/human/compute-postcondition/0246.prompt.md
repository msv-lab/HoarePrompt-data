Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` before the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` starting right after the first space, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a[g]` is either `int(a[g]) - 1` or `0` (if it was `int(a[g]) - 1` and became 0), and `a[d]` is either `int(a[d]) - 1` or `int(a[d]) - 2` (if it was `int(a[d]) - 1` and became 0). If an exception occurs, the loop is broken and the state of `a[g]`, `a[d]`, `g`, and `d` is unknown.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 2`, `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 2`, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains the same, `g` is increased by 1 if `a[g]` equals 0, and `d` is decreased by 1 if `a[d]` equals 0. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a[g]` is 0, `a[d]` is -3, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains the same, `g` is incremented by 1, and `d` is decremented by 2 if `a[d]` equals 0. The loop or statement is broken if an exception occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
