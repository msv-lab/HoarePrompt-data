Based on the initial state provided:

- `z` is incremented by 1, but its value is not needed since it does not appear in the print statement.
- `t` is an input integer, but its value is also not needed since it does not appear in the print statement.
- `a` is a list of integers split from an input string, but again, its value is not needed since it does not appear in the print statement.
- `n` is the first element of `a`.
- `k` is the second element of `a`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'0'`.

Output: **0**
