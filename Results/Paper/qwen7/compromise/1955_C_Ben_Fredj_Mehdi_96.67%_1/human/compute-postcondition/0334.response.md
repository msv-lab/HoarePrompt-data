Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is the second element of `a` and must be a positive integer such that `1 < k // 2`; `a[g]` is decreased by 1; `a[d]` is decreased by 1; `g` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `g += 1` increments the value of `g` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
