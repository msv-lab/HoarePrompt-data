Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `k // 2`.

3. **Analyze the given states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 2`
   - `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 2`
   - `i` is incremented by 1
   - `k` remains the same
   - `g` is increased by 1 if `a[g]` equals 0
   - `d` is decreased by 1 if `a[d]` equals 0

4. **Update the relevant states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `k // 2`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `k // 2 - 1` (since `i` was incremented by 1).

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `a[g]` and `a[d]` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `g` is increased by 1 if `a[g]` equals 0.
   - `d` is decreased by 1 if `a[d]` equals 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 2`, `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `k` remains the same, `g` is increased by 1 if `a[g]` equals 0, and `d` is decreased by 1 if `a[d]` equals 0.**
