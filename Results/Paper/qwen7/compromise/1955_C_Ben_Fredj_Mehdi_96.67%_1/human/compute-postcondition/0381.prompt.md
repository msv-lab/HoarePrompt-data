Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, and we are about to read the next input values for n and k, and the list a.
Code of the loop:
for z in range(t):
    a = input()
    n = int(a[:a.find(' ')])
    k = int(a[a.find(' ') + 1:])
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if k == 1999999998:
        print('0')
    elif k == 1999999999:
        print('1')
    elif k == 99999999999:
        print('99')
    elif n == 1 and k == 10000000000000 and a[0] == 1:
        print('1')
    elif k == 9999999999:
        print('9')
    elif n == 101 and k == 100000000000:
        print('1')
    elif k == 10000000000000:
        print('10000')
    elif k == 99999999999999:
        print('99999')
    elif k == 199999999999999:
        print('199999')
    elif k == 1000000000000:
        print('1000')
    elif k == 200000000000:
        print('200')
    elif k == 2147483648 and n == 2:
        print('2')
    elif n == 2 and k == 1000000000 and a == [1000000000, 1000000000]:
        print('0')
    elif n == 5 and k == 2147483648:
        print('2')
    elif n == 20 and k == 10000000000:
        print('10')
    elif k == 5999999999:
        print('5')
    elif k == 4294967295:
        print('8')
    elif n == 2 and k == a[0] - 1 and k == a[1] - 2:
        print('0')
    elif k == 3000000000:
        print('2')
    elif k >= sum(a):
        print(len(a))
    else:
        d = len(a) - 1
        g = 0
        for i in range(k // 2):
            try:
                a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
                a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
                if a[g] == 0:
                    g += 1
                if a[d] == 0:
                    d -= 1
            except:
                break
        if k % 2 == 1:
            a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        print(a.count(0))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, and after the execution of the if-else block:
- If `k` equals 1999999998, `k` remains 1999999998.
- If `k` equals 1999999999, `k` remains 1999999999.
- If `k` equals 99999999999, `k` remains 99999999999.
- If `k` equals 1 and the first element of `a` equals 1, `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged and is not equal to 1999999999, 99999999999, 5999999999, 4294967295, 3000000000, or the second element of `a` minus 2.
- If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in `a`, `d` is set to `len(a) - k // 2 - 1`, `g` is set to `k // 2`, `k` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, and if `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` before the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` starting right after the first space, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces. If `k` equals 1999999998, `z` remains incremented by 1. Otherwise, `z` remains incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `z` is incremented by 1. If `k` equals 1999999998, `z` remains incremented by 1. If `k` equals 1999999999, 2147483648, 5999999999, 4294967295, 199999999999999, 100000000000, 10000000000000, or the sum of list `a`, `z` remains incremented by 1. If `k` equals 2147483648 and `n` equals 2 or 5, or if `k` equals 10000000000 and `n` equals 20, or if `n` equals 101 and `k` equals 100000000000, `z` remains incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `k` is less than the sum of list `a`, `z` is incremented by half of `k` (rounded down), `t` remains unchanged, and the elements at indices `g` and `d` in list `a` are decremented appropriately, with `k` remaining as the second element of `a` and being a positive integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
