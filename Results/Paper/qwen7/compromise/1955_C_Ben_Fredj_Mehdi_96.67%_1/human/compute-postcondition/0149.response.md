Postcondition: `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `d` is now `len(a) - k // 2 - 1`, `g` is `k // 2`, `k` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`, and if `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decremented by 1. In both cases, `g` remains `k // 2` and `d` is adjusted to `len(a) - k // 2 - 1`. If an exception occurs during the execution of the `try` block, the loop will break.
