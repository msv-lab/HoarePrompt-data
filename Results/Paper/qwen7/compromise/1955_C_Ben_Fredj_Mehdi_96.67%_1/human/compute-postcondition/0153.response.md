Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, and either `n` is not equal to 2 or `k` is not equal to `a[0] - 1` or `k` is not equal to `a[1] - 2`. If `k` is 3000000000, then `k` remains 3000000000. Otherwise, `k` is not 3000000000, `k` is not equal to `a[1] - 2`, and if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a`, then `k` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`. If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`, then `d` is set to `len(a) - k // 2 - 1`, `g` is set to `k // 2`, `k` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, and if `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decremented by 1.**
