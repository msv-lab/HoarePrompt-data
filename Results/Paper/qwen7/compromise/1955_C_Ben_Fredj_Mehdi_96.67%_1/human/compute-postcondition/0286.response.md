Output State: **`z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the second element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input string, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The values of `z` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `a` now holds a list of integers, where the first element corresponds to the integer value of the substring before the first space in `a`, and the second element corresponds to the integer value of the substring after the first space in `a`. The variables `n` and `k` are updated to refer to these elements in the list `a`.
