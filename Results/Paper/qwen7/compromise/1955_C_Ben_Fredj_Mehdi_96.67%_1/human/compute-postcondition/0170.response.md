Postcondition: `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, and `k` is updated based on the following conditions:
- If `k` equals 99999999999999, then `k` remains 99999999999999.
- Otherwise, depending on the values of `n` and `k`:
  - If `n` is 2 and `k` is 2147483648, then `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
  - If `n` is 5 and `k` is 2147483648, then `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
  - If `n` is 20 and `k` is 10000000000, then `k` remains 10000000000.
  - If `n` is 2 and `k` is 2, then `k` remains unchanged.
  - If `k` is 5999999999, then `k` remains 5999999999.
  - If `k` is 4294967295, then `k` remains 4294967295.
  - If `k` is 3000000000, then `k` remains 3000000000.
  - If `k` is not 2 or `n` is not 2, then `k` is not equal to the second element of `a` minus 2.
  - If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a`, then `k` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in `a`.
  - If `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`, then `d` is set to `len(a) - k // 2 - 1`, `g` is set to `k // 2`, `k` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, and if `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decremented by 1.
