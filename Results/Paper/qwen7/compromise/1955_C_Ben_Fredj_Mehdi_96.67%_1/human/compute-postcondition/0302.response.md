The initial state describes the following:
- `z` is incremented by 1, but since it is not used in the print statement, its value does not affect the output.
- `t` is an input integer, but it is not used in the print statement either.
- `a` is a list of integers split from an input string, but the specific values of `a` are not provided.
- `n` is the first element of `a`.
- `k` is the second element of `a`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'5'`.

Output: **5**
