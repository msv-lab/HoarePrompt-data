`g` is incremented by 1. The value of `g` was initially 0, so now `g` is 1. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `a[d]` is `a[d] - 1`, and the current value of `a[g]` is 0.
