Postcondition: `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, and either `n` is not equal to 2 or `k` is not equal to `a[0] - 1` or `k` is not equal to `a[1] - 2`. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 3000000000, and `k` is less than the sum of the elements in the list `a`.
