Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
- The conditions for `n`, `k`, and the first element of `a` ensure that they have specific values as described.
- The current value of `k` is explicitly stated as 199999999999999.

The print statement is:
```python
print('199999')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'199999'`.

Output: **199999**
