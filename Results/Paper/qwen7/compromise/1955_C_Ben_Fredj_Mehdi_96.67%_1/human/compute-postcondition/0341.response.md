At which point in the program could such an exception occur? The exception could occur when trying to convert `a[g]` or `a[d]` to an integer using `int()`. This would happen if `a[g]` or `a[d]` is not a valid integer string.

Summarize what the try except statement accomplishes: The `try` block attempts to decrease the values of `a[g]` and `a[d]` by 1. If `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If any of these operations fail (e.g., due to a non-integer value), the `except` block is executed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is the second element of `a` and must be a positive integer such that `1 < k // 2`; `a[g]` is decreased by 1 if it is a valid integer; `a[d]` is decreased by 1 if it is a valid integer; if `a[g]` equals 0, then `g` is increased by 1; if `a[d]` equals 0, `d` is decreased by 1; the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
