Output State: **`a[g]` is -1, `a[d]` is -3, `g` is incremented by 2 compared to its initial value, `d` is decremented by 2 compared to its initial value, and k is an odd number**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[g]` by subtracting 1 from its current value, which was initially 0. So, `a[g]` becomes -1. The values of `a[d]`, `g`, `d`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
