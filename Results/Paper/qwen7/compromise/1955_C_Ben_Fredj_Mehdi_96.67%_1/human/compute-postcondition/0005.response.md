Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input from the user, splits it into elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
