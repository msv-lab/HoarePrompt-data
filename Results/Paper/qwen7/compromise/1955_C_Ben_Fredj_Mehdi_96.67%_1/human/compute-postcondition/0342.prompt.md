Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, `n` is the first element of `a`, `k` is the second element of `a`, `d` is the length of `a` minus 1, `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, the first element of `a` decreased by 1, `k` is the second element of `a` and must be a positive integer, `d` is the length of `a` minus 2, `g` is 0, `i` is 0, `a[d]` is decreased by 1, and if `a[g]` (which is now 0) equals 0, then `a[g]` remains 0. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if an exception occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers split from the input string, the first element of `a` is decreased by 1, `k` is the second element of `a` and must be a positive integer such that `1 < k // 2`, `d` is the length of `a` minus 3, `g` is 1, `i` is 1. If no exception occurs, `a[d]` is now a value that is 2 less than its original value, otherwise, the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2; `k` is the second element of `a` and must be a positive integer such that `1 < k // 2`; `a[g]` is decreased by 1 if it is a valid integer; `a[d]` is decreased by 1 if it is a valid integer; if `a[g]` equals 0, then `g` is increased by 1; if `a[d]` equals 0, `d` is decreased by 1; the state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
