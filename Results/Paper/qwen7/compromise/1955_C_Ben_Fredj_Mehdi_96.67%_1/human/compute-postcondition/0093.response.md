Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `n` is the first element of the list `a` converted to an integer. Given that the current value of `n` is 2.
   - `k` is the second element of the list `a` converted to an integer. Given that the current value of `k` is the first element of `a` minus 1, and also the second element of `a` minus 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces. Since the current value of `n` is 2, `a` must have at least two elements. Let's denote the first element of `a` as `a[0]` and the second element of `a` as `a[1]`.

2. **Given Conditions:**
   - `n` is 2.
   - `k` is the first element of `a` minus 1, and also the second element of `a` minus 2.
   - This implies that if `a[0] = x` and `a[1] = y`, then `k = x - 1` and `k = y - 2`.

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - From the conditions, we can set up the equations:
     - `k = x - 1`
     - `k = y - 2`
   - Therefore, `x - 1 = y - 2`, which simplifies to `x = y - 1`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the following print statement:
     ```
     print('0')
     ```

Based on the above analysis, the print statement will output the string `'0'`.

Output: **'0'**
