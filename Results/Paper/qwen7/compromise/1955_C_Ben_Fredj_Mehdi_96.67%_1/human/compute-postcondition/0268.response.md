Postcondition: **`z` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer, `n` is the first element of the list `a` before the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring of `a` starting right after the first space, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces. If `k` equals 1000000000000, 200000000000, 2147483648, 4294967295, or 3000000000, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in `a`, `z` remains incremented by 1. Otherwise, `a[g]` is -1, `a[d]` is -3, `g` is incremented by 2 compared to its initial value, `d` is decremented by 2 compared to its initial value, and `k` is an odd number.**
