Output State: **`a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 1`, `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[d]` by subtracting 1 from its current integer value. Similarly, the value of `a[g]` is also updated by subtracting 1 from its current integer value. The initial conditions for `a[g]` and `a[d]` are preserved, and only their values are modified according to the given operations.
