Output State: **The state is unknown and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values; it only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since the initial state is unknown, we cannot specify any variable values. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
