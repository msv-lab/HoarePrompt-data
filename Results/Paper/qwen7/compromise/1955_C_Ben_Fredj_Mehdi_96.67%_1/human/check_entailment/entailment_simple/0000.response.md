Reasoning:
The annotated program attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues and logical errors. Here are the key points:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the entire line as a string and then splits it into `n` and `k`. This is incorrect because `n` and `k` should be read separately from the input.

2. **Hardcoded Conditions**: The program uses hardcoded conditions to handle specific edge cases, which is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results if the input does not match these specific conditions.

3. **Incorrect Logic for General Case**: The logic for handling the general case where `k` is not one of the hardcoded values is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.

4. **Exception Handling**: The use of a `try-except` block inside the main loop is unnecessary and can mask potential errors.

5. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: Some edge cases are not handled correctly, leading to incorrect outputs.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the problem statement and will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

Correctness: **False**
