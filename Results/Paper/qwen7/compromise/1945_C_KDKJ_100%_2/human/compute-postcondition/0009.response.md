Output State: `a` is an input string consisting only of '0' and '1', and `n` is the length of this string; `S` is a list containing one sublist where the first element is the count of '0's in `a` and the second element is the count of '1's in `a`; `ans` is the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` while satisfying the condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`.
