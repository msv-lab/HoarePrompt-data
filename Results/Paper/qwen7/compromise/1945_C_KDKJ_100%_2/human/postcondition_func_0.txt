The function reads an integer `n` and a binary string `a` of length `n`. It then calculates the counts of '0's and '1's at each position in the string and stores these counts in a list `S`. Afterward, it finds the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` while ensuring that the number of '0's to the left of `i` is less than half the number of positions to the left of `i`, and the number of '1's to the right of `i` is less than half the number of positions to the right of `i`. Finally, it prints the found index `i`.
