The function accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It searches for the character at index `i` of string `a` within the substring of string `b` starting from index `j`. If the character is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence relative to `j`. If the character is not found, it returns `-1`.
