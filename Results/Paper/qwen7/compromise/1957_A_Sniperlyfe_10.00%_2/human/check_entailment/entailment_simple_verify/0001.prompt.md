You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `freq` dictionary contains key-value pairs where each key is a unique stick length from the `arr` list, and the corresponding value is the frequency (count) of that stick length in the original list.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, where each frequency is the count of a unique stick length in the original list `arr`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths into an array `arr`.
3. It then calls the function `func_1(arr)` to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed.
4. The function `func_1(arr)` works as follows:
   - It creates a frequency dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It iterates over the array `arr`, updating the frequency of each stick length.
   - It calculates the number of complete polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 (since each polygon has 4 sides).
   - It sums up these values to get the total number of polygons.
5. The logic in `func_1` correctly determines the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed because:
   - Each polygon requires 4 sticks of the same length.
   - The division by 4 ensures that we only count complete polygons.
   - Summing up the results for each unique stick length gives the total number of polygons.
6. The program does not handle cases where the number of sticks of a particular length is less than 4, which is correctly handled by the division operation.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
