Output State: **`counter` is 0, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', where the i-th character of s1 is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box initially, and '0' otherwise; the i-th character of s2 is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box, and '0' otherwise.**

Explanation: The variable `counter` is initialized to 0. No changes are made to `n`, `s1`, or `s2`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
