Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `k` is the first integer input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \((n * (n - 1)) // 1\) modulo \(1000000007\), `M` is \(1000000007\), `s` is 0, `n` and `m` are updated to the values of the integers input by the user, `k` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `s = 0` initializes the variable `s` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `c`, `M`, `s`, `n`, and `m` which remain as described in the initial state.
