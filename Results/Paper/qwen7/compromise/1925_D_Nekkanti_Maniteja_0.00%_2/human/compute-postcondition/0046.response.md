Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is the first integer input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \((n * (n - 1)) // 1\) modulo \(1000000007\), `M` is \(1000000007\), `s` is \(2 * c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a\)**

Explanation: The variable `s` was initially defined as `c * i * c * m + c * a`. After executing the line `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `s` is updated to include an additional term `c * i * c * m + c * a`. Since `i` is 1, `i * i` remains 1. Thus, the new value of `s` becomes `c * 1 * c * m + c * a + c * 1 * c * m + c * a`, which simplifies to `2 * c * c * m + 2 * c * a`.
