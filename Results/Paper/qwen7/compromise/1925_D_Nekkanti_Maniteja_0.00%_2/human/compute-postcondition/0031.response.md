Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `1000000007`, `M` is 1000000007, `s` is 0, `a` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `a = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `a`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, `M`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
