Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input**.

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input separated by spaces and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The variable `i` is initially set to `m`, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the value of `i` is still `m`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now the integers entered by the user.
