The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `m` must still be a positive integer.

State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer**
