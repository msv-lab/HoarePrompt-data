Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is the first integer input, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `1000000007`, `M` is `1000000007`, `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Since `i` is 0, `c * i * c * m` becomes 0. Thus, `s` is updated to `c * a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
