Output State: **`i` is `m`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 1` modulo `M`, `M` is 1000000007, `s` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `s` to 0. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, `M`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
