Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The provided code does not attempt to construct the permutation \( p \). Instead, it creates a list `mex` based on certain conditions but does not use this list to generate the permutation.
3. The logic in the code does not correctly follow the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not ensure that the elements of the permutation \( p \) are unique and cover all integers from 0 to \( n-1 \).
4. The code does not handle the construction of the permutation \( p \) as required by the problem statement.

Given these observations, the provided code does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
