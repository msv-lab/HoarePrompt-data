Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The function `func_1()` is supposed to generate such a permutation \( p \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - The function initializes `mex` as an empty list and sets `minn` and `maxx` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \) and constructs the `mex` list based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.
   - After constructing the `mex` list, it prints the values in `mex`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The function correctly handles the logic for calculating the MEX and adjusting the values accordingly.
   - The function prints the `mex` list, which should correspond to the permutation \( p \) based on the given conditions.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The output format matches the requirements: for each test case, it prints the permutation \( p \) on a new line.
   - The function does not return any value but prints the result directly, which is acceptable as per the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to generate the permutation \( p \) based on the given conditions. Therefore, the provided function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
