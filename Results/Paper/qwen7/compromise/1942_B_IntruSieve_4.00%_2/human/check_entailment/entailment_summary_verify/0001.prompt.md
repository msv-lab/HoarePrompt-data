You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[MOOO! - Doja Cat](https://soundcloud.com/amalaofficial/mooo)

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            if abs(arr[i] - minn) > maxx:
                maxx = abs(arr[i] - minn)
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It calculates a list `mex` which contains values starting from `minn` up to the maximum value in `arr`, along with some differences based on conditions. Finally, it prints each value in `mex` in order, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value but modifies a local list `mex` and prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a` for each test case.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `minn` and `maxx` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array `arr` and calculates the MEX value for each position.
   - If `arr[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to the `mex` list and increments `minn`.
   - If `arr[i]` is negative, it appends the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i])` and `minn` to the `mex` list.
   - It updates `maxx` if the calculated MEX value is greater than the current `maxx`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program prints the values in the `mex` list, which should represent the permutation `p`.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Correctness of MEX Calculation:**
  - The logic for calculating MEX seems correct. It ensures that the MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of the permutation.
  - However, the program does not actually construct the permutation `p` but instead constructs a list `mex` that should match the MEX values as defined in the problem.

- **Permutation Construction:**
  - The program does not explicitly construct the permutation `p` from the `mex` list. Instead, it directly prints the `mex` values.
  - According to the problem, the `mex` values should be used to construct the permutation `p`, but the program does not do this.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles both positive and negative values in `arr` correctly.
  - It ensures that `minn` and `maxx` are updated appropriately to reflect the MEX values.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. It constructs a list of MEX values (`mex`) instead of constructing the actual permutation `p`. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
