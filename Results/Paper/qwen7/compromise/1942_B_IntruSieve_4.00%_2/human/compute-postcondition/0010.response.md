Based on the initial state provided:

- `itm` takes on each value in `mex` in order, starting from `minn` up to the maximum value in `arr`.
- `minn`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `mex` remain unchanged.
- `maxx` remains unchanged.

Given this information, the `print()` statement does not have any arguments provided inside it. Therefore, when the `print()` function is called, it will print nothing.

Output: **None**
