Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and an array `a` of `n` integers where -`n` ≤ a_i ≤ `n`. The function does not return a value but processes each test case according to the given constraints and array.**
