Output State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `minn = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `minn`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `mex`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
