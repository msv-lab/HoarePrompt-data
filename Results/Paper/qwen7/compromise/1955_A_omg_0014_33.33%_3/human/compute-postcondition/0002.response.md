Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` based on the condition `if a * b < a * d`. The number of lines will be equal to `n`, which is the number of iterations the loop will execute. Each line's content depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` provided by the user input for each iteration.
