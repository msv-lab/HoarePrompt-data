### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified several issues with the given program. Let's break down the problems and verify the corrected approach:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `d`:**
   - The original program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is the price for one yogurt under the promotion. This is correct in terms of the promotion price, but the issue lies in how the promotion is applied.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Promotion Usage:**
   - The original program simply compares `a * b` with `a * d` and chooses the cheaper option. This logic is flawed because it doesn't account for the optimal way to use the promotion. Specifically, it doesn't consider buying as many pairs as possible to minimize the cost.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the minimum cost, we need to:
     - Calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought (`pairs = a // 2`).
     - Calculate the remaining individual yogurts (`remaining = a % 2`).
     - Compute the total cost using the promotion for pairs and the regular price for the remaining individual yogurts (`total_cost = pairs * c + remaining * b`).

The corrected program provided in the original assessment correctly implements this logic. Here is the corrected version again for clarity:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        # Number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought
        pairs = a // 2
        # Remaining individual yogurts
        remaining = a % 2
        # Total cost using promotion for pairs and regular price for remaining
        total_cost = pairs * c + remaining * b
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the promotion is used optimally by buying as many pairs as possible and then buying the remaining individual yogurts at the regular price. This approach guarantees the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the given program and provided a corrected version. The corrected program is indeed correct according to the problem description.

**Final: True**
