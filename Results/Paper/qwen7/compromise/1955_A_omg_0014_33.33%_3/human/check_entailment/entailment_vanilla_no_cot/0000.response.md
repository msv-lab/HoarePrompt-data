Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Promotion Price**: The variable `d` is assigned `c / 2`, which is not correct. The correct way to calculate the promotion price per yogurt when buying two is `b / 2`.

2. **Rounding Issue**: The code uses `round(a * d)` to round the total cost, which might not always give the minimum cost due to how rounding works. For example, if the calculated cost is 14.5, `round(14.5)` will give 15, which is not necessarily the minimum cost.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic to determine whether to buy at the regular price or the promotion price is flawed. It simply compares the cost of buying all yogurts individually with the cost of buying half of them in pairs. This does not account for scenarios where buying some yogurts individually and others in pairs could yield a lower cost.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (n_yogurts, price_per_yogurt, promotion_price_for_two) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the cost if all yogurts are bought individually
        cost_individual = n_yogurts * price_per_yogurt
        
        # Calculate the cost if we maximize the use of the promotion
        num_pairs = n_yogurts // 2
        remaining_yogurts = n_yogurts % 2
        cost_promotion = num_pairs * (promotion_price_for_two) + remaining_yogurts * price_per_yogurt
        
        # Determine the minimum cost
        min_cost = min(cost_individual, cost_promotion)
        print(min_cost)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering both the individual purchase and the promotion-based purchase strategies.
