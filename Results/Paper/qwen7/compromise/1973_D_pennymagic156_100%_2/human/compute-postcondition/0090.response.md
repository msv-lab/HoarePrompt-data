Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and the condition `(cnt == 0 and l == n + 1)` holds true.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `cnt` will have been reduced to `0` because the loop continues to decrement `cnt` until it reaches `0`. The variable `l` will be `func_2() + 1` because `l` starts from `1` and is incremented by `1` each time through the while loop, but since the loop exits when `l` equals `n + 1`, `l` will be exactly `n + 1`. However, the problem statement specifies that the loop prints `! {i * v}` and returns when `cnt` is `0` and `l` is `n + 1`, which confirms that the final state of `l` should be `func_2() + 1` (since `l` increments by `1` each iteration and stops at `n + 1`). Therefore, the condition `(cnt == 0 and l == n + 1)` is satisfied, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations as intended.
