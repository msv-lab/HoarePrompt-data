Output State: **`cnt` is `k`, `l` is `1`, `i` is `k - 2`**

Explanation: The code updates `cnt` to `k` and `l` to `1`. The initial value of `cnt` was `k - 3`, so it is now updated to `k`. The value of `l` was initially `func_2() + 3`, and it is now set to `1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The condition that either `cnt` is not equal to 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1` is still valid since `l` is now `1`, which is not equal to `n + 1` (assuming `n` is a variable that does not affect the current state).
