Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and the condition `cnt == 0 and l == func_2() + 1` is true**

Explanation: The function `func_2()` is called, but its exact return value is not specified in the initial state. Since the condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` was true before calling `func_2()`, and `cnt` remains unchanged (as no operation on `cnt` is performed), `l` remains `func_2() + 1`. After calling `func_2()`, the value of `l` will be updated to `func_2() + 1`, but the condition `cnt == 0 and l == func_2() + 1` will still be true because `cnt` is still 0 and `l` is now `func_2() + 1`.
