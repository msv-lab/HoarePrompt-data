Output State: `cnt` is `0` and `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `cnt` is non-zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `cnt` has been decremented by 3, making it `k - 3`. For the loop to finish executing all iterations, `cnt` must reach 0. Since `l` was set to `func_2() + 1` after the third iteration and the condition `l < n + 1` must still hold true, `l` remains `func_2() + 1` after all iterations.
