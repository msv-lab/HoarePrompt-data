Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cnt` is defined as `k - 2`, where `k` must be greater than 2.
     - Since `k > 2`, the minimum value `k` can take is 3, making `cnt = 3 - 2 = 1`.
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`, where `func_2()` must return a value less than `n`.
     - The exact value of `func_2()` is not specified, but it must be less than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`.
     - `i` and `v` are not defined in the initial state, so they are unknown.
     - The value of `l` is `func_2() + 1`, where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.

Given the above breakdown, the print statement will output a formatted string with the value of `l` and the product of `i` and `v`. Since `i` and `v` are not defined, they will remain as `i` and `v` in the output.

Output: **'? [func_2() + 1] [i * v]'**
