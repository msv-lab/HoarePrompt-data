Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` is `k`
- `l` is `1`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 0

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Here, `i` and `v` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since they are not provided, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we can infer that `i * v` will be a product of `i` and `v`.

Given the initial state, the only explicitly defined variable is `l`, which is `1`. The value of `cnt` is `k`, but it does not appear in the `print` statement. The variable `n` is not used in the `print` statement either.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output a string with placeholders for `l`, `i`, and `v`. Since `l` is explicitly defined as `1`, the string will include `1` for `l`. For `i * v`, we cannot determine the exact value without knowing `i` and `v`.

Output: **'? 1 [i * v]'**
