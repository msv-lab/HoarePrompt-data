Output State: **`cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the value of `func_2()` plus 1. Since the exact value returned by `func_2()` is not specified, `l` takes the form of `func_2() + 1`. The value of `cnt` remains `k - 1` as it was not affected by the code snippet. The condition that `l` must be less than `n + 1` is still valid but cannot be further simplified without knowing the exact value of `func_2()`.
