Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`
   - `l` must be `func_2() + 1`
   - `func_2() + 1` must be less than `n + 1`

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`.
- Since `func_2() + 1` must be less than `n + 1`, we can infer that `l` is a value between 1 and `n` (inclusive), because `func_2()` returns an integer and adding 1 to it gives a value within this range.

However, the values of `i` and `v` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine their exact values. We can only say that `i * v` will be the product of `i` and `v`.

Given this information, the print statement will output a formatted string with `l` and `i * v`, but since `i` and `v` are not specified, we can only describe them as `i` and `v`.

Output: **'? [l] [i * v]' (where l is func_2() + 1 and i * v is the product of i and v)**
