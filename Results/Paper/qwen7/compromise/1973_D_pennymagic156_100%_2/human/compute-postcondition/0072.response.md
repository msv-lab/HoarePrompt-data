Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cnt` is `k` and `cnt` must be non-zero.
     - This means `cnt = k` and `k` is a non-zero value.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 3` and `l` must be less than `n + 1`.
     - This means `l = func_2() + 3` and `func_2()` returns a value such that `l < n + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`
     - Here, `i` and `v` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine their exact values. However, we know that `l` is defined as `func_2() + 3` and it satisfies the condition `l < n + 1`.

Given this information, the print statement will output a formatted string with the value of `l` and the product of `i` and `v`. Since `i` and `v` are not specified, we can only describe them as `i * v`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'? [l] [i * v]' where l = func_2() + 3 and i * v is the product of i and v**
