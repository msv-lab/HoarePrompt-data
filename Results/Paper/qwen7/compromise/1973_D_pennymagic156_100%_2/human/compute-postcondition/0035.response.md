Output State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0; `l` is equal to `func_2()` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` by adding 1 to the result of `func_2()`. Since the exact value returned by `func_2()` is not specified, we represent it as `func_2()`. The precondition that `cnt` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the new value of `l` is expressed as `func_2() + 1`.
