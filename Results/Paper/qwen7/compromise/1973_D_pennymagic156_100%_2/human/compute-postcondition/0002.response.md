Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The loop starts with `i = n` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` becomes less than 0.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**: From the problem statement, we know that `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\) and `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\). Additionally, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `v` is 1 (which is not relevant to the loop).

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to start executing, `i` must be initialized to a value that satisfies the loop condition. Since the loop starts with `i = n` and `n` is a positive integer, `i` will be initialized to a value greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `i` is initialized to a value that is within the valid range for the loop to start.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial values of `i` and `n` that satisfy the loop condition.

**State:**
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is initialized to `n`, which means `i` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq i \leq n \leq 10^4\)

Combining these, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is initialized to `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq i \leq n \leq 10^4\))**.
