Output State: **`cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to be the result of `func_2()` plus 1. Since the exact value returned by `func_2()` is not specified, we express `l` as `func_2() + 1`. The precondition that `cnt` must be non-zero remains unchanged.
