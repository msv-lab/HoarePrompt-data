Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` is `k - 1`
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `l` is a variable that must be less than `n + 1`, but its exact value is not specified.
- `i` and `v` are not defined in the initial state, so they are unknown.

Given this, the print statement will include the value of `l` and the product of `i` and `v`.

Output: **? [l] [i * v]** (where `[l]` is a value less than `n + 1` and `[i * v]` is the product of `i` and `v`)
