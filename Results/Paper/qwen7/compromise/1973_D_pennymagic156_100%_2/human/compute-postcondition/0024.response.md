Output State: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `1`, and `v` is `1`.

Explanation: The loop decrements `i` from `n` to `1`. After the loop completes, `i` will be `1`. The variable `v` is set to `i` when `v` equals `n`, which happens on the first iteration. Therefore, after all iterations, `v` remains `1`. The other variables (`n` and `k`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
