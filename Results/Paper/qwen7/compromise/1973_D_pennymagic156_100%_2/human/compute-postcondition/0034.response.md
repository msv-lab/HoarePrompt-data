Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` must be greater than 0.
- `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

Here, `i` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is part of the formula `i * v`. Since `v` is also not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will express the output in terms of the variables involved.

Given the format of the print statement, it will print a string with placeholders for `l` and `i * v`. Since `i` and `v` are not specified, we will leave them as they are.

Output: **'? [l] [i * v]'**
