Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cnt` is `k - 1` and `cnt` must be non-zero.
     - This means `cnt = k - 1` and since `cnt` must be non-zero, `k` cannot be 1. So, `k > 1`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 2` and `l` must be less than `n + 1` and `func_2()` must return a value less than `n - 1`.
     - Let's denote the return value of `func_2()` as `x`. Therefore, `l = x + 2` and `x < n - 1`. Since `l < n + 1`, it follows that `x + 2 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `x < n - 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`.
     - Here, `i` and `v` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, they are placeholders in the string format. We need to assume their values to proceed. Since no specific values are provided for `i` and `v`, we will leave them as they are in the output.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output a string with the value of `l` and the product of `i` and `v`. The value of `l` is determined by the function `func_2()` plus 2, and it must satisfy the conditions mentioned.

Output: **'? [func_2() + 2] [i * v]'**
