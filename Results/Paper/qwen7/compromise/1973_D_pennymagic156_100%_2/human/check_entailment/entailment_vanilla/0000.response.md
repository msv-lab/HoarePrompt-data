Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly reads `n` and `k` for each test case using `func_3()`.

2. **Querying for Maximum Value:**
   - The program attempts to find the maximum value `v` such that `f(1, r) = i * n` for some `i`.
   - It starts from `i = n` and decreases `i` until it finds a valid `v`.

3. **Checking Validity of `v`:**
   - For each `i`, it prints a query `? 1 {i * n}` and checks the response.
   - If the response is `n`, it breaks the loop and sets `v = i`.

4. **Splitting the Array:**
   - It then tries to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray has the same product `i * v`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to `k` and `l` to `1`.
   - For each subarray, it prints a query `? {l} {i * v}` and updates `l` to the response plus one.
   - If it successfully splits the array (`cnt == 0` and `l == n + 1`), it prints the answer `! {i * v}`.

5. **Handling Invalid Queries:**
   - If it cannot split the array into `k` subarrays with the same product, it prints `! -1`.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Incorrect Query Logic:**
   - The program assumes that `f(l, r)` can be queried directly by setting `x = i * n`. However, the actual value of `x` might not always be `i * n` but rather the smallest `x` such that `f(l, r) = x`.
   - This assumption might lead to incorrect results if the actual `x` is smaller than `i * n`.

2. **Looping Logic:**
   - The program uses a decrementing loop starting from `n` to find `v`. This might not always find the correct `v` if the array has specific properties that make `f(l, r)` smaller than expected.

3. **Splitting Logic:**
   - The splitting logic assumes that `i * v` is the correct product for each subarray. This might not always be true if the array has specific values that do not fit the pattern.

### Conclusion:

Given the potential issues with the query logic and the splitting logic, the program does not fully implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
