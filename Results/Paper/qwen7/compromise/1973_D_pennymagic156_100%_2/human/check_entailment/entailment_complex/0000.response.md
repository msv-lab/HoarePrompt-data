Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**: This function reads a space-separated string of integers from standard input and returns a list of those integers. While this function is not directly used in the main logic of `func_5()`, it seems to be a utility function for reading input, which is consistent with the problem's requirements.

2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function reads an integer from standard input and returns it. This function is used in `func_5()` to get the response from the judge for the queries.

3. **Function `func_3()`**: This function reads two integers from standard input, representing `n` and `k`, and returns them as a map object. This function is called in `func_5()` to initialize `n` and `k`.

4. **Function `func_4()`**: This function reads a line of input from standard input and returns it after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. This function is not used in `func_5()`.

5. **Function `func_5()`**: This function implements the main logic of the problem. It:
   - Reads `n` and `k` using `func_3()`.
   - Initializes `v` to 1.
   - Performs a series of queries to find the maximum value `v` such that the conditions of the problem are satisfied.
   - Uses nested loops to check if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required properties.
   - Prints the final result if the conditions are met, otherwise prints `-1`.

Given the provided functions and their descriptions, the overall logic of `func_5()` aligns with the problem statement. The function correctly initializes variables, performs the necessary queries, and prints the appropriate results based on the conditions specified in the problem.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
