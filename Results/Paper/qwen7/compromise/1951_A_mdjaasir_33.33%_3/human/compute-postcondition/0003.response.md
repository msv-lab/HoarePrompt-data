Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions evaluated for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, the value of `n` (obtained from `input()`) and the string `a` (also obtained from `input()`) are processed to determine if the number of '1's in `a` meets certain criteria, and then either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed accordingly. The final output state will be a list of these printed results, one for each iteration of the loop.
