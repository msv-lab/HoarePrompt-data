Functionality: **The function reads multiple inputs from the user, processes each input to count the occurrences of '1' in a given string, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions related to the count. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses.**
