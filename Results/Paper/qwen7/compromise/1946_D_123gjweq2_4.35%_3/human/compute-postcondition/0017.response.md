Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the result of find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1) and the length of new_arr.**

Explanation:
- `xor` is 0, which means no bits have been set in the `xor` operation so far.
- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers.
- `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being processed.
- `x` is an integer, but its value is not relevant to the return statement.
- `new_arr` is a list of integers where each element is the result of the XOR operation on the subarray of `cur_arr` where the specified bit is either 0 or 1.
- `thing1` is -1 because the if condition is true (i.e., the bit in `xor` is 1).

The return statement calculates the maximum value between two things:
1. The result of calling `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)`, which finds the maximum XOR subarray sum for the subarray of `cur_arr` up to the previous bit.
2. The length of `new_arr`, which represents the number of subarrays considered so far.

Since we do not have the actual values of `cur_arr` and `bit`, we cannot compute the exact numerical result, but we can describe what the program returns in terms of these variables.
