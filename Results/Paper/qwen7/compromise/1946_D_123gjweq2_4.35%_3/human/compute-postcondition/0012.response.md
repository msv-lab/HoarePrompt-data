Output State: **`xor` is 0, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `bit` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `new_arr` is a list of integers where each element is the result of the XOR operation on the subarray of `cur_arr` where the specified bit is 1, `thing1` is the maximum value found in `new_arr` for the bit-1 position.**

Explanation: The code `thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` assigns the maximum value found in the `new_arr` list at the index `bit - 1` to the variable `thing1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
