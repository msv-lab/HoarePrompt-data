Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `[l_i, r_i]` such that the cumulative XOR of each segment does not exceed a given number `x`. The solution uses a recursive approach to process each bit of the XOR values.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`, which is incorrect because `find_max` should be called with the value of `x` instead of a fixed value `31`.
   - The function `find_max` is supposed to handle the bit manipulation and segment processing correctly.
3. **Function `find_max` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly initializes variables and processes the array segment by segment based on the current bit.
   - It handles the base case when `bit == -1` by returning the length of the current segment.
   - It correctly processes the array to find segments where the XOR of elements up to the current bit is zero or one, and recursively finds the maximum value for the next bit.
   - The logic for determining whether to include the current segment or not based on the bit value of `x` is correct.

Given the analysis, the main issue is in the call to `find_max` in `func_1`, where it should pass `x` instead of `31`.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, replace the call to `find_max` in `func_1` with:
```python
return find_max(arr, x)
```

This change will ensure that the function correctly processes the array based on the given `x` value.
