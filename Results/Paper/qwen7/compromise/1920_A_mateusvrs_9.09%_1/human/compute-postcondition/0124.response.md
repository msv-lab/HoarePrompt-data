Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `a` and `x`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is not affected by this code.
