Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input**.

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `x`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The values of `a` and `x` are specifically integers derived from the input.
