Output State: **`cx` is empty, `tmp` is equal to the total number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`, `r` is a list with one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`. Since `cx` is empty, `tmp` remains as the total number of elements in an empty list that are within the range `[bx, ax]`, which is 0. Thus, `r` now contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - 0`, which simplifies to `ax - bx + 1`.
