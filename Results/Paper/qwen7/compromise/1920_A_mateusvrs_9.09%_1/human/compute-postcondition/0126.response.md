Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 1, `x` is an integer from the input, `bx` is equal to the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`.**

Explanation: The code `bx = max(x, bx)` assigns to `bx` the maximum value between `x` and the current value of `bx`. Since `bx` was not initialized before, it takes the value of `x`. Therefore, `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and its previous (non-existent) value, which is simply `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
