Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(n)`. The only variable here is `n`, which is used as the range parameter.

2. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: The state before the loop starts mentions that `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer because `range(n)` will not generate any values if `n` is zero or negative.

3. **Check other variables**: The other variables (`t`, `r`, `_`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`) are not involved in the loop head, so their current states do not affect whether the loop can execute. They can remain unchanged.

4. **Formulate the required state**: Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `n` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be a positive integer**
