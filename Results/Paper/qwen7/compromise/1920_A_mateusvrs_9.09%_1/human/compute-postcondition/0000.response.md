Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, the value of `t` is now an input integer within this range. The precondition that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2 remains valid, but the specific values of these constraints are not known and thus not included in the output state.
