Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `cx` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cx` contains at least one element.
   - `i` is the next element from `cx`.
   - `tmp` is incremented by 1.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is further incremented by 1.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `cx` is a collection (list or similar), it will be modified to exclude the current element `i` that was processed in the previous iteration.
   - `i` will be the next element from the updated `cx`.
   - `tmp` will be incremented based on the condition in the loop body, but since we are determining the state before the next iteration, we cannot determine the exact value of `tmp` yet. However, we know that `tmp` will be incremented if the condition is met.

5. **New State**:
   - `cx` will now contain all elements except the one that was just processed (i.e., the current `i`).
   - `i` will be the next element from the updated `cx`.
   - `tmp` will be incremented by 1 (as per the postcondition).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cx` contains at least one element (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element from `cx`, and `tmp` is incremented by 1**.
