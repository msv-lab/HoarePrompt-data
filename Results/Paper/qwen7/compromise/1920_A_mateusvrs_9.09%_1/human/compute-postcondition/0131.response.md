Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the original `x` and `ax`, `ax` is the minimum of the original `x` and `ax`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. Since `a` is initially 2 and does not change, and `x` is an integer from the input, `ax` will now hold the smaller value between the original `x` and `2`. The conditions for `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
