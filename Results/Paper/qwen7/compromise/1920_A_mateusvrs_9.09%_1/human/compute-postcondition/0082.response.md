Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is an integer from input; `x` is an integer from input; `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and `ax`.**

Explanation: The line `ax = min(x, ax)` assigns to `ax` the minimum value between `x` and `ax`. Since `x` and `ax` are both integers from input, `ax` will now hold the smaller of the two values. The conditions and values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
