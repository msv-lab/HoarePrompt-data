Postcondition: **`bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, and `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. The current value of `bx` is greater than or equal to the current value of `ax`.**
