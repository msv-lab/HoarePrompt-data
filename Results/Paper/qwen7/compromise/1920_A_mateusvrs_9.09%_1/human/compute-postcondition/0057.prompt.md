Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tmp` is 0, `n` will be 0, `ax` will be the smallest value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `bx` will be less than `ax` among all `x` where `a` was 1, and `cx` will be a set containing all `x` where `a` was neither 1 nor 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cx` must contain at least one element, `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, in which case `tmp` is increased by 1. If `i` is not within the range `[bx, ax]`, the value of `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cx` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` remains increased by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains increased by 1 as well since there is no else part changing its value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cx` must contain at least one element (excluding the current `i`), `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 2 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`. If `i` does not satisfy this condition, `tmp` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
