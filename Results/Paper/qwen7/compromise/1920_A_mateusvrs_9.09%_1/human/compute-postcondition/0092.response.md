Output State: **`a` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx` if `a` equals 1, `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and `ax` if `a` equals 2, otherwise `x` is added to the set `cx`, `cx` contains the value `x`, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. The other variables remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.
