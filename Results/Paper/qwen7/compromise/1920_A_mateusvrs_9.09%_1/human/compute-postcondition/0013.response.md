Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `a` is 2, `x` is an input integer, and `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 2.**

Explanation: The code `ax = min(x, ax)` assigns to `ax` the minimum value between `x` and `ax`. Given that `a` is an input integer and currently equals 2, and `ax` is equivalent to `a * x`, the value of `ax` is now the minimum of `x` and 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
