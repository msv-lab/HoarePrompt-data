Output State: **All elements in `cx` are equal to `bx` plus `tmp`, and `tmp` is incremented for each element in `cx` that falls within the range `[bx, ax]` until no more elements in `cx` satisfy this condition; `r` contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`. The value of `tmp` is incremented each time an element in `cx` falls within the range `[bx, ax]`. After appending the value to `r`, the value of `tmp` is updated but the elements in `cx` remain unchanged from their initial state.
