Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `n` will have reached 0, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations. `a` and `x` will be those provided in the last input to the loop. `bx` will hold the highest `x` value where the operation was `a == 1`, `ax` will hold the lowest `x` value where the operation was `a == 2`, and `cx` will contain all `x` values for which `a` was neither 1 nor 2. Additionally, if the condition `bx >= ax` is true, `r` will contain the value 0. Otherwise, `cx` will be empty, `tmp` will be equal to the total number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`, and `r` will be a list with one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
