Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - It initializes variables `ax` and `bx` to keep track of the upper and lower bounds of `k`.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store values that `k` must not be equal to.
3. **Updating Bounds and Exclusions**:
   - For constraints of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to ensure it is the maximum value among the current `bx` and the new constraint value `x`.
   - For constraints of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to ensure it is the minimum value among the current `ax` and the new constraint value `x`.
   - For constraints of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds the excluded value `x` to the set `cx`.
4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, it means there are no feasible values for `k`, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of feasible values for `k` by subtracting the count of excluded values within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of values in the range `[bx, ax]`.
5. **Outputting Results**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The logic handles all constraints correctly and ensures that the solution accounts for all types of constraints as specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
