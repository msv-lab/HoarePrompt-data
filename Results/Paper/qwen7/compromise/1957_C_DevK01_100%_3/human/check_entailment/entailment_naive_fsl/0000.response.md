Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic to update `n` (the size of the board) is incorrect. When a move is made, the board size should be reduced by the number of unattacked rows and columns, not just by 2 or 1. The current implementation simply subtracts 2 or 1 from `n` without considering the actual reduction in available positions due to the placement of rooks.

For example, consider a 4x4 board with one move placed at (1, 2). The correct reduction would be to subtract 2 rows and 2 columns, leaving a 2x2 board. However, the current code only reduces `n` by 2, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to keep track of the attacked rows and columns and adjust the board size accordingly. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
    attacked_rows = set()
    attacked_cols = set()
    
    for j in range(k):
        L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
        attacked_rows.add(a)
        attacked_cols.add(b)
    
    # Calculate the number of unattacked rows and columns
    unattacked_rows = n - len(attacked_rows)
    unattacked_cols = n - len(attacked_cols)
    
    # The final board size is the product of unattacked rows and columns
    final_board_size = unattacked_rows * unattacked_cols
    
    print(final_board_size % (10**9 + 7))
```

This corrected version properly accounts for the reduction in available positions and calculates the correct number of possible final configurations.
