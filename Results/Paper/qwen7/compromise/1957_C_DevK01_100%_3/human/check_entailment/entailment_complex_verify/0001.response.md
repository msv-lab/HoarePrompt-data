### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `k`, and the coordinates of the moves made by the player.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program iterates through the `k` moves and adjusts the value of `n` based on whether the move was mirrored or not.
     - If `a != b`, it means the move was mirrored, so `n` is decreased by 2 (one for the player and one for the computer).
     - If `a == b`, it means the move was not mirrored, so `n` is decreased by 1 (only the player's move).
   - This logic is correct and matches the problem description.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` with base cases `[1, 1]`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `n` and calculates the values of `dp` using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - Finally, it returns `dp[n]`.
   - The recurrence relation used in `func_1` is correct for calculating the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an \(n \times n\) board. This is a well-known combinatorial problem related to derangements and rook polynomials.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The program ensures that all calculations are taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.
   - This is necessary to avoid overflow and ensures the result fits within the required constraints.

### Verification:

- **Base Cases:**
  - For `n = 1`, the only possible configuration is having no rooks, so `dp[1] = 1`.
  - For `n = 2`, the possible configurations are either no rooks or one rook in each of the two rows/columns, so `dp[2] = 1`.
  - These base cases are correctly handled.

- **Recurrence Relation:**
  - The recurrence relation used in `func_1` is correct for calculating the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an \(n \times n\) board.
  - The implementation of the recurrence relation is correct and matches the expected behavior.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases correctly by adjusting `n` based on the moves made and ensuring the final result is calculated modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
  - The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly processes the input, adjusts the board size based on the moves, and uses the correct dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
