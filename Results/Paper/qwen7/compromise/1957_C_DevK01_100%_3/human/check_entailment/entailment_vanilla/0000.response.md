Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each of the `k` moves, the program reads the coordinates `(a, b)` of the move.
   - If `a != b`, it means the computer mirrored the move, effectively removing 2 rows/columns from consideration (one for the white rook and one for the black rook).
   - If `a == b`, it means the computer couldn't mirror the move, so it removes only 1 row/column.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to compute the number of possible configurations.
   - It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The base cases are initialized as `[1, 1]`.
   - For each subsequent value up to `n`, it calculates the number of configurations using the recurrence relation: `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`.
   - Finally, it returns `dp[n]`.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required range (10^9 + 7).

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - The base cases `[1, 1]` are correct because for a 1x1 board, there is exactly 1 way to place a rook, and for a 2x2 board, there are 2 ways to place rooks without them attacking each other.

2. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)` is derived from the combinatorial problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a board.
   - This formula correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board by considering the placement of rooks in the previous row and column.

3. **Handling Removed Rows/Columns:**
   - The logic for reducing the board size by 1 or 2 based on whether the move was mirrored is correct.
   - This ensures that the remaining board size accurately reflects the available space for placing rooks.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly computes the number of configurations for each test case and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
