Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `c` and `casos`.
2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `c` is less than `casos`. Initially, `c` is set to 0 in the range function.
3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since `c` starts at 0 and the loop will continue as long as `c < casos`, the loop will execute if `casos` is greater than 0. Additionally, `c` should be initialized to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `casos` is an input integer.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).

We need to ensure that the loop can start and execute properly. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `casos` to be greater than 0 and `c` to be 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`casos` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**
