Output State: The output will consist of multiple patterns printed based on the value of `n` for each iteration of the loop. For each `c` in the range from 0 to `casos-1`, if `n` is 1, two lines of "##" will be printed. If `n` is 2, four lines of specific patterns will be printed. If `n` is 3, six lines of specific patterns will be printed. If `n` is 4, eight lines of specific patterns will be printed. If `n` is greater than 4, the message "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range") will be printed for that iteration. The exact number of iterations and the specific patterns printed depend on the value of `casos`.
