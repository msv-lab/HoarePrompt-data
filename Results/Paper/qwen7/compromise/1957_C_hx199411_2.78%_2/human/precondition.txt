t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The coordinates (r_i, c_i) for each of the k moves you made are valid, meaning they do not place a rook in the same row or column as any previously placed rook, and r_i ≠ c_i unless it is the last move and the computer cannot mirror it.
