Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is verified by the loop that decrements `t` until it reaches zero.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `n` and `k` are correctly initialized from the input for each test case. The variable `num` is used to count the number of diagonal moves (where `c == r`), and `m` is calculated as `n - num`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The program sets up a dynamic programming array `dp` to store the number of configurations for a given number of remaining cells. The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correctly defined.

4. **Recurrence Relation**: The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is correctly implemented to compute the number of configurations for `i` cells. This relation accounts for the two possible ways to place rooks in the remaining cells without attacking each other.

5. **Output Calculation**: The program correctly computes the final number of configurations using the dynamic programming array `dp` and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
