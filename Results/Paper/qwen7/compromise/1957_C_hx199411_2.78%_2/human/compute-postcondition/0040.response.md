Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between 0 and 2*k, `i` is 3, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + (2 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` where `i` is initially set to 2. However, since the code sets `i` to 3, `dp[3]` is calculated as `(dp[2] + (3 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Given the initial conditions `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, the calculation becomes `(3 + 2 * 1 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = (3 + 4) % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 7 % (10 ** 9 + 7) = 7`. All other variables remain unchanged.
