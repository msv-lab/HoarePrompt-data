Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` will be equal to `k`, `c` and `r` will be the last integers inputted by the user during the loop's final iteration, and `num` will be the sum of 2 added for each pair of inputs where `c` does not equal `r`, plus 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r`.**

This means that `num` will be calculated based on the total number of pairs where `c` equals `r` (each contributing +1 to `num`) and where `c` does not equal `r` (each contributing +2 to `num`). The value of `i` will be the final iteration index, which is `k-1` if the loop runs exactly `k` times.
