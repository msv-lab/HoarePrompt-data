Output State: **`dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `i` is `k`, `num` is the sum of increments based on the condition in the loop, and `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted during the final iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The code initializes `dp[1]` to 1. All other elements in the `dp` list remain 0, `i` remains `k`, `num` remains the sum of increments based on the condition in the loop, and `c` and `r` remain the last integers inputted during the final iteration of the loop.
