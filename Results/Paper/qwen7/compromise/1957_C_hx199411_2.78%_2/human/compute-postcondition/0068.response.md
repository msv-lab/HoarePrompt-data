Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < k`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3, and `k` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since `i` is either 2 or 3, and the loop continues as long as `i < k`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if `i` was 2, it will become 3, and if `i` was 3, it will become 4.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- If `i` was 2, it will become 3.
- If `i` was 3, it will become 4.
- `k` remains greater than 0.

Since we don't know the exact initial value of `i`, we consider both possibilities, but the key point is that `i` will increment by 1.

**Final State**:
- `k` must still be greater than 0.
- `i` will be either 3 (if it was 2) or 4 (if it was 3).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is either 3 or 4**
