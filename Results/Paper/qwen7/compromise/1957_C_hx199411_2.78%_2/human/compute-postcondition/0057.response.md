Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the current value of `c` is equal to the current value of `r`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is updated by incrementing it by 1. Since the initial value of `i` was 0, after executing `num += 1`, the value of `i` becomes 1. The values of `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
