Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` equals `k`, `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted during the loop's final iteration, `num` is the sum of 2 added for each pair of inputs where `c` does not equal `r`, plus 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r`, and `m` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `n` is the first integer inputted, `k` is the second integer inputted, `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The values of `c` and `r` remain unchanged from their previous state, as they are not affected by this line of code. The value of `num` remains unchanged because no operation is performed on it within this line. The value of `m` also remains unchanged as it is not involved in this operation. The value of `t` is decreased by 1, but since the exact value of `t` was not specified in the initial state, we only note that `t` is decreased by 1.
