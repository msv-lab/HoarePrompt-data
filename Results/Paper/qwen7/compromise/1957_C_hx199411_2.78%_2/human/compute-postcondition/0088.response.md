Output State: **`dp[i + 1]` is updated to `(dp[i] + (i) * dp[i - 1] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `m` is `m`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the previous values of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`. The value of `dp[i+1]` is already defined in the initial state, and the code does not affect `m`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1` for the next iteration.
