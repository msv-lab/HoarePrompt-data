Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is either 3 or 4, `c` is an integer from the input, `r` is an integer from the input, `num` is increased by 1.**

The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Since `num` was previously an unspecified integer (based on the input), it is now increased by 1. All other variables (`k`, `i`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
