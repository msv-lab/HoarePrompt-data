Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between 0 and 2*k, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `m` is `n - num`**.

The value of `m` is calculated as `n - num`, where `num` ranges from 0 to 2*k. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `i`) remain unchanged.
