Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between 0 and 2*k, `i` is 4, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + (2 - 1) * dp[1] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7), and for each `i` from 4 to `m`, `dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)**.

This means that the dynamic programming list `dp` has been updated according to the given recurrence relation starting from `i = 4` up to `i = m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
