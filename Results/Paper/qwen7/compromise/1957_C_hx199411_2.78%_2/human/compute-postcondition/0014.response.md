Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < k`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `num` is either 1 or 2.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `c` is an integer from the input split.
   - `r` is an integer from the input split.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, after the previous iteration, `i` is now 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`. Given that `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute again as long as `k` is greater than 0.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `num` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `c` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `r` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split.**
