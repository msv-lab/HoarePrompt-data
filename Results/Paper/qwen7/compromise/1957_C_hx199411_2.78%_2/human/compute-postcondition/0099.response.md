Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `i` equals `k`, `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted during the loop's final iteration, `num` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to `k`; `n` is the first integer inputted, `k` is the second integer inputted, `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `num = 0` sets the variable `num` to 0. All other variables (`k`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `m`, `n`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
