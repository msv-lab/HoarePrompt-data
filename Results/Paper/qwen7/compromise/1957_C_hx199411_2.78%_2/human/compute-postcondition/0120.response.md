Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `num` will be the sum of increments based on the condition in the loop, and `c` and `r` will be the last integers inputted during the final iteration of the loop.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will still be set to `k` since the loop increments `i` from 0 to `k-1`. The variable `num` will hold the total count of increments, which is determined by the condition inside the loop: it increments by 1 if `c` equals `r`, and by 2 if they do not. The variables `c` and `r` will contain the values of the last integers inputted during the final iteration of the loop. All other variables' states remain as per their initial or last updated conditions within the loop body.
