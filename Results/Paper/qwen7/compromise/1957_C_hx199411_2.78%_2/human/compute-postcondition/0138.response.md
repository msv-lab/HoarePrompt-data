Output State: **`dp[i + 1]` is calculated as `(dp[k - 1] + (k - 1) * dp[k - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `dp[i]` is updated to `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2` and less than or equal to `m`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition on `m` remains the same.
