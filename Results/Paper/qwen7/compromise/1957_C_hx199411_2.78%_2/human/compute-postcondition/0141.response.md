Based on the initial state described, the `dp` list is computed such that each value `dp[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `m`) is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, starting with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. After the loop completes, `dp[i]` will reflect the computed values up to `dp[m]`.

The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]`, which is the last computed value in the `dp` list following the given formula.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value computed according to the formula (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7) for i from 3 to m, starting with dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3)**
