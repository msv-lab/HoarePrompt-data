Based on the initial state provided, the `dp` list will contain values computed according to the given recurrence relation. Specifically:

- `dp[1] = 1`
- `dp[2] = 3`
- For \(i\) from 3 to `m`, each element `dp[i]` is calculated as \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

After the loop completes, the `dp` list will have a length of `m + 1` and will contain these values. The print statement will output the last element of this list, which corresponds to `dp[m]`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `dp[m]` as computed by the recurrence relation.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is computed as (dp[m-1] + (m-1) * dp[m-2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7))**
