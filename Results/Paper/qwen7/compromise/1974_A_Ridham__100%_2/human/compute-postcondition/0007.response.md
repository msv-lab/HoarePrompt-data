Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \)). For each test case, it reads pairs of integers \( x \) and \( y \) (where \( 0 \leq x, y \leq 99 \)), calculates the required screen space based on certain conditions, and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line.**
