Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `y`, which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
3. It calculates the total space required for the icons. The space for 1x1 icons is simply `x * 1`, and for 2x2 icons, it's `y * 4`.
4. The program then calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`screen_require_for_y`). If `y` is even, it divides `y` by 2; otherwise, it divides `y` by 2 and adds 1.
5. It calculates the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons on the screens. This is done by subtracting the space taken by the 2x2 icons from the total space available on the screens (`15 * screen_require_for_y`).
6. If the remaining space is sufficient to fit all 1x1 icons, it appends the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons to the result list.
7. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons and adds them to the total number of screens.
8. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for each test case based on the provided constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
