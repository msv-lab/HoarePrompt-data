Output State: **`j` is 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `todo` does not contain `a[0]`, `done` contains `a[0]`, and `extra` contains `a[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element `a[0]` from the `todo` list, assuming `j` is 1 (as per the initial state). After removing `a[0]` from `todo`, `j` is incremented by 1 (from 1 to 2) because the next logical step would be to check `a[1]` (if it exists), but since no further action is specified, we assume `j` is updated to 2. The conditions for `m` and the membership of `a[0]` in `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain as described in the initial state.
