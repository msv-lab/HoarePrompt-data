Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m + 1`; `done` has removed `old`.**

Explanation: The code `done.remove(old)` removes the value of `old` from the list `done`. The other variables (`ans`, `r`, and `old`) remain unchanged. The condition for `ans` depends on the current length of `done` relative to `k - 1`, which remains unaffected by this operation.
