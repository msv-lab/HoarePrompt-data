Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `a[r]` is currently in `todo`, `old` is in `extra` and not in `done`, `old` is added to `todo` and removed from `done`, `a[r]` is no longer in `todo`**.

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the set `todo`. Given the conditions, `a[r]` was previously in `todo`. After removing `a[r]` from `todo`, it is no longer in `todo`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
