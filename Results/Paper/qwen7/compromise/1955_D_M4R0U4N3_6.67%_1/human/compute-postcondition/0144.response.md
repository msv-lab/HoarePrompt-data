Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `r`, `m`, and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `m` to `n-1` (inclusive). This means `r` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Determine the New Value of `r`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is `m`. For the next iteration, `r` will be `m + 1`.

4. **Adjust Other Variables Based on the Loop Condition**: Since `m` and `n` do not change within the loop, they remain the same as their initial values. 

5. **State After the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `r` is `m`
   - `m` is some integer
   - `n` is some integer greater than `m`

6. **State Before the Next Iteration**: 
   - `r` will be `m + 1`
   - `m` remains the same
   - `n` remains the same

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`**
