Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `num_test_cases` is the number of test cases (an integer), `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The variables `t`, `num_test_cases`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
