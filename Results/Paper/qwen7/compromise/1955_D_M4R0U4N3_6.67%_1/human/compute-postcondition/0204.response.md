Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, `j` is `j + 1`, `todo` has removed the element `a[j]` from itself, `done` has added `a[j]` to itself.**

Explanation: The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `done`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `done` now contains `a[j]` if it was previously in `todo`, and `todo` has had its `a[j]` element removed.
