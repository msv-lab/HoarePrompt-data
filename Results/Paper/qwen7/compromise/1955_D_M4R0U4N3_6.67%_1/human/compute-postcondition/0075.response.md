Postcondition: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m`, `n`, `a`, `extra`, `todo`, `done`, and `ans` remain as follows: if `old` is in `done`, then `done` is reduced by `old` if `old` was present, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if the length of `done` is at least `k`. If `old` is not in `done`, `done` remains unchanged, and `todo` now includes `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` was in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`.**
