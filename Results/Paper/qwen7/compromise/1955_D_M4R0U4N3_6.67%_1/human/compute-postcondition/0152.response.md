Postcondition: `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`. If `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) is in `extra`, then `extra` list has the element `old` removed. If `old` is in `done`, then `done` has had the element `old` removed, and `todo` has added the element `old`. If `old` is not in `done`, then the values of `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.
