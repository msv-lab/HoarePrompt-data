Postcondition: `r` is `m + 1`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `old` is either no longer in `extra` or is now `a[r - m]`, `extra` either does not include `a[r - m]` or includes `a[r - m]`, `done` is `done` plus `a[r]` if `a[r]` is in `todo`, otherwise `done` is `done` minus `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` is in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`.
