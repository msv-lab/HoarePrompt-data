Postcondition: `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is in `extra`, then `old` is removed from `extra`, and `a[r - m]` is no longer stored in `old`. If `old` is in `done`, then `done` no longer contains `old`, `todo` contains `old` added, and `a[r - m]` retains its original value. If `old` is not in `done`, then `a[r - m]` retains its original value and `todo` and `done` remain unchanged.
