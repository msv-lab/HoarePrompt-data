Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m`, `n`, `a`, `extra`, `done` now includes `a[r]`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if the length of `done` is at least `k`, `todo` now includes `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` was in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`, and `todo` no longer contains `a[r]`.**

This means that the variable `done` has added the element `a[r]` to itself. If the length of `done` is now at least `k`, the counter `ans` has been incremented by 1. The set `todo` now includes `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` was previously in `done`, or it now includes `a[r]` and possibly `a[r - m]` (if `a[r - m]` was not already included) if `old` was not in `done`. Additionally, `todo` no longer contains `a[r]`. All other variables (`m`, `n`, `a`, `extra`, `old`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
