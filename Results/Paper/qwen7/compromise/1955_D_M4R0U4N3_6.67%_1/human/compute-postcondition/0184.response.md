Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input value, `k` is an integer equal to the third input value, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `todo = set(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a set from these integers. The values of `a`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
