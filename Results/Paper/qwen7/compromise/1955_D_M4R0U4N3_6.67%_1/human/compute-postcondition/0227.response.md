Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; `todo` does not contain `old`; `old` is no longer in `extra`; `todo` has had one element removed, which was `a[r]`; `done` now contains `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code adds `a[r]` to the set `done`. Since the other variables (`ans`, `r`, `todo`, `old`, and `extra`) are not affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged. The only new information is that `done` now includes the element `a[r]`.
