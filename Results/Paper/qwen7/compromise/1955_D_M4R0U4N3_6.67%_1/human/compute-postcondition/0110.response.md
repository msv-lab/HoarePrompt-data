Output State: **`j` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is either the same as before or with `a[0]` removed, `done` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is empty, and `extra` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`, and `extra` now includes `a[1]` if `a[1]` was not previously in `extra`; `extra` is updated to include `a[j]` which is `a[2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `j` remains 2. The list `a` and the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` retain their previous states with the additional condition that `extra` now includes `a[2]` (since `j` is 2).
