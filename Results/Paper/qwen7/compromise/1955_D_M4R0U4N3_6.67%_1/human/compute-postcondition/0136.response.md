Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `extra` contains the element `a[r]`, `old` remains unchanged in `done` if it was there, and `old` is added to `extra` if it was not there.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the set `extra`. Since `r` is equal to `m`, `r` remains `m`. The value of `n` is unaffected and remains greater than `m`. The condition about `old` being in `extra` or `done` does not change because the code only adds an element to `extra` and does not modify `old` or its presence in `done`.
