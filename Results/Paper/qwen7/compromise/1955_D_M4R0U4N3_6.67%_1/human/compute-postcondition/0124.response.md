Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `old` is not in `extra`, and `old` is no longer in `done`.**

Explanation: The code removes the value of `old` from the set `done`. Since `old` was previously in `done`, after executing `done.remove(old)`, `old` is no longer in the `done` set. All other variables remain unchanged.
