Output State: **`j` is 3, `m` is greater than 3, `extra` contains either `a[0]` or `a[1]`, `todo` does not contain `a[j]`, and `done` contains either `a[0]` or `a[1]` depending on whether `a[3]` was in `todo` or not.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `a[j]` from the `todo` list. Given that `j` is 3, the code removes `a[3]` from `todo`. The other variables (`m`, `extra`, `todo`, and `done`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
