Postcondition: `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, else `ans` is 0; `r` is `m`; if `a[r]` is in `todo`, `todo` does not contain `old`, `old` is no longer in `extra`, and `todo` has had one element removed, which was `a[r]`, and `done` now contains `a[r]`; otherwise, `ans` is 0, `todo` does not contain `old`, `old` is no longer in `extra`, and `extra` contains `a[r]`.
