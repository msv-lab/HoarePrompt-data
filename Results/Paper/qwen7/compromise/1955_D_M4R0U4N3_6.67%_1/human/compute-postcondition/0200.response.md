Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[j]` is in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `done` now includes `a[2]` and `todo` has `a[j]` removed. If `a[j]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains `a[2]` and `j` is set to 3.**
