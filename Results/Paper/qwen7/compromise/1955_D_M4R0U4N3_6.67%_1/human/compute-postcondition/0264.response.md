Output State: **`old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`, if `old` is in `extra`, then `old` is removed from `extra`, and `a[r - m]` is no longer stored in `old`. If `old` is in `done`, then `done` no longer contains `old`, `todo` contains `old` added, and `a[r - m]` retains its original value. If `old` is not in `done`, then `a[r - m]` retains its original value and `todo` and `done` remain unchanged; `todo` does not contain `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the set `todo`. The conditions related to `old` and its interactions with `extra`, `done`, and `a[r - m]` remain unchanged unless `old` was specifically `a[r]`. Since `old` is not directly involved in this operation, its state remains as described in the initial postcondition.
