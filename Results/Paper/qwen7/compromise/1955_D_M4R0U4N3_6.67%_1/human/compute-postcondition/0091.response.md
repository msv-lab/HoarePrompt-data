Output State: **`n` is the input integer minus 1, `m` is the input integer `m`, `k` is the input integer `k`, `r` is equal to `n`, `old` is the last element processed in the loop, `extra` contains all elements from `a` that were not in `todo` and hence added to `extra` during the loop, `done` contains all elements from `a` that were removed from `todo`, `todo` is now a set of integers obtained from the input, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it is 0; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `todo = set(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a set from these integers. This set replaces the previous value of `todo`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
