Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input value, `k` is an integer equal to the third input value, `todo` is a set of integers obtained from the input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `extra`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of all variables except for `extra`, which is now an empty set.
