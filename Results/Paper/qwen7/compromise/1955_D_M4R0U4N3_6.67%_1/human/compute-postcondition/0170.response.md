Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `todo` does not contain `a[r]`, `extra` and `done` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code removes `a[r]` from the `todo` list. Since `r` is defined as `m + 1`, `a[r]` is the element at index `m + 1` in the list `a`. The values of `m`, `n`, `extra`, and `done` remain unchanged because the code does not affect them.
