Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable `j` is used in the loop, and the loop iterates over the range from `0` to `m-1`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is currently `0`.
   - If the element at index `j` (which is `a[0]`) is in the list `todo`, then `todo` is updated to remove `a[0]` and `done` contains `a[0]`.
   - Otherwise, `a` is a list of integers where the first element (`a[0]`) is now in `extra`.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `0` and the loop increments `j` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `1`.
   - We need to consider both scenarios (whether `a[0]` is in `todo` or not) to determine the state.

### Scenario 1: `a[0]` is in `todo`
- If `a[0]` is in `todo`, then `todo` is updated to remove `a[0]`, and `done` contains `a[0]`.
- Therefore, `a` will no longer contain `a[0]`, and `extra` will not be affected since `a[0]` was already moved to `done`.

### Scenario 2: `a[0]` is not in `todo`
- If `a[0]` is not in `todo`, then `a` is a list of integers where the first element (`a[0]`) is now in `extra`.

Since we don't know the exact condition at the end of the previous iteration, we need to consider both possibilities. However, the loop will continue as long as `j < m`.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the incremented value of `j`:

**State: **`j` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is either the same as before or with `a[0]` removed, `done` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is empty, and `extra` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`.**
