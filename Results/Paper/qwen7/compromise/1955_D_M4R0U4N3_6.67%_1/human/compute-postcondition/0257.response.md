Output State: **`old` is removed from `extra`, `a[r - m]` is no longer stored in `old`.**

In this scenario, the code removes the value of `old` from the list `extra`. The value of `old` was originally assigned as `a[r - m]`, but after executing `extra.remove(old)`, `old` is no longer stored in `extra`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
