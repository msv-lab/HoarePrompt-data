Postcondition: `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`. If `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) is in `done`, then `done` has had the element `old` removed and `todo` now contains the element `old`. If `old` is not in `done`, then nothing changes regarding `done` and `todo`.
