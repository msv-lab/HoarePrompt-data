Output State: **`j` is 3, `m` is greater than 3, `extra` contains `a[0]` or `a[1]` and now also contains `a[3]`, `todo` does not contain `a[0]`, and `done` contains `a[0]` or `a[1]` depending on whether `a[3]` was in `todo` or not.**

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[j]` to the set `extra`. Given that `j` is 3, `extra` now includes `a[3]` in addition to whatever elements it originally contained (which is either `a[0]` or `a[1]`). All other variables remain unchanged.
