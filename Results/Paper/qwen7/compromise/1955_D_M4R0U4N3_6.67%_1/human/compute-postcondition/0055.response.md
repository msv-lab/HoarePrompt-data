Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `r` is defined in the range `range(m, n)`.
   - The loop head also involves the variables `m`, `n`, `a`, `old`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `r` starting from `m` up to but not including `n`.
   - The loop body is omitted, so we need to focus on how the variables change based on the given postcondition.

3. **Analyze the Postcondition:**
   - After the previous iteration, `r` is `m`.
   - `old` remains in both `extra` and `done`.
   - `todo` either contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]`.
   - If `a[r]` is in `todo` and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `old` is removed from `extra` and added to `done`.
   - Otherwise, `old` remains in `extra` and `done` unchanged, and `extra` includes `a[r]` while `done` includes `old`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `r` starts from `m` and the loop increments `r` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `r` will be `m + 1`.
   - The values of `m`, `n`, `a`, `old`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless the loop body changes them.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `r` will be `m + 1`.
   - `m`, `n`, `a`, `old`, `extra`, `done`, and `todo` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `old` remains in `extra` and `done`, `todo` either contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo` and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `old` is removed from `extra` and added to `done`. Otherwise, `old` remains in `extra` and `done` unchanged, and `extra` includes `a[r]` while `done` includes `old`.**
