Output State: **`r` is `m`, `old` is either in `extra` and `done`, or remains in `extra` and `done` unchanged, `todo` does not contain `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the list `todo`. Since `a[r]` was in `todo` (as per the initial state), it is now removed. The value of `r` remains `m`, and `old` either gets added to `todo` and removed from `extra` and `done`, or remains in `extra` and `done` unchanged, depending on its initial state.
