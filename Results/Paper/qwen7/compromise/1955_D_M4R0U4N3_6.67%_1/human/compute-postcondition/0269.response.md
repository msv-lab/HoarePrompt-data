Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `old` is assigned the value of `a[r - m]`, if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `old` remains unchanged, `a[r - m]` retains its original value, and `todo` and `done` remain unchanged. If `a[r]` is in `extra`, then `old` is removed from `extra`, and `a[r - m]` is no longer stored in `old`. If `a[r]` is in `done`, then `done` no longer contains `old`, `todo` contains `old` added, and `a[r - m]` retains its original value. If `a[r]` is not in `done`, `extra`, or `todo`, then `a[r - m]` retains its original value and `todo` and `done` remain unchanged.**

This means that the `ans` variable has been incremented by 1, while the conditions regarding the `old`, `a[r - m]`, `a[r]`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` variables remain as described in the initial state.
