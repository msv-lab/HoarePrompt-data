Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `extra` list remains unchanged, `done` list may have the element `old` removed and `todo` list has had the element `a[r]` removed.**

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the element `a[r]` from the `todo` list. The values of `r`, `m`, `n`, `extra`, and `done` remain unchanged unless `a[r]` was in `done`, in which case `done` would have the element `old` removed and `todo` would have added the element `old`. Since `old` is only removed from `done` if it is present there, and `a[r]` is being removed from `todo`, the final state reflects these changes.
