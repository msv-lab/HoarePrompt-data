Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `j` will be equal to `m-1`. The variable `todo` will contain the elements of `a` that were not added to `done`. The set `done` will contain all unique elements from `a` that were present in `todo` during the loop's execution. The set `extra` will contain all elements from `a` that were not found in `todo` and were not already in `extra`. The variable `ans` will be 1 if the size of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it will be 0.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `r` is `m`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) remains unchanged in `done` if it was there, and `old` is added to `extra` if it was not there. The length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `extra` list remains unchanged, `done` list has the element `a[r]` added, and `todo` list has had the element `a[r]` removed. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` now contains the element `a[r]`, and `done` and `todo` remain unchanged. Additionally, `ans` is increased by 1 if the condition `len(done) >= k` is met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `done` now contains `a[r]`, and `extra` remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` now contains `a[r]`, and `done` and `todo` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
