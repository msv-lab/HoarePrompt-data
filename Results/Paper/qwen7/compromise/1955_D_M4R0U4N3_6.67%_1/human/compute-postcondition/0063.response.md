Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `old` is either no longer in `extra` or is now `a[r - m]`, `extra` either does not include `a[r - m]` or includes `a[r - m]`, `done` is `done` minus `old` if `old` is in `done`, and `todo` does not contain `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code removes `a[r]` from the `todo` list. The other variables remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.
