Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `todo` is a set of integers, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[j]`, `j` is 0.**

The code adds the element `a[j]` to the `extra` set. Since `a[j]` was not already in `todo`, the values of `a`, `m`, `k`, `todo`, `done`, and `j` remain unchanged. The `extra` set now contains the element `a[j]`.
