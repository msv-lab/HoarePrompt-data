Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` remains the same, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `old` is no longer defined (as it was removed from `done`), `extra` either does not include `a[r - m]` or includes `a[r - m]` (depending on its previous state), `done` is `done` minus `old` if `old` was in `done`, otherwise `done` remains unchanged if `old` is not in `done`, and `todo` either contains `a[r]` and `a[r - m]` if `old` was in `done`, or contains `a[r]` or does not contain `a[r]` if `old` is not in `done`. Additionally, if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1.**

This output state reflects the removal of `old` from the `done` set. The other variables remain unchanged or their states are updated based on the conditions specified.
