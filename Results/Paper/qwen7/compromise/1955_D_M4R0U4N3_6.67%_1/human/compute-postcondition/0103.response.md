Output State: **`j` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `todo` is either the same as before or with `a[0]` removed, `done` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was in `todo`, otherwise `done` is empty, and `extra` contains `a[0]` if `a[0]` was not in `todo`, `todo` has `a[0]` removed**.

Explanation: The code `todo.remove(a[j])` removes the element at index `j` from the `todo` list. Given that `j` is 1, it attempts to remove `a[1]` from `todo`. The conditions for `done` and `extra` remain unchanged unless `a[0]` was specifically noted to be in `todo` or not. The value of `j` remains 1, and the list `a` is not directly modified by this operation, only `todo` is updated by removing `a[1]`.
