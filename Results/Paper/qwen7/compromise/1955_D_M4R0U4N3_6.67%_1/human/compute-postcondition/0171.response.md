Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `todo` does not contain `a[r]`, `extra` remains unchanged, `done` now contains `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code adds `a[r]` to the set `done`. Since `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is some integer, and `n` is some integer greater than `m`, `r` is also an integer. The condition that `todo` does not contain `a[r]` remains unchanged, and `extra` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
