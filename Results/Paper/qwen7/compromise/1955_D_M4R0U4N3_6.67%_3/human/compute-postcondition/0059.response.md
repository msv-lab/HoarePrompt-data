Output State: **`old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `r` is `m + 1`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 1]`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans` remain unchanged except `done` now does not contain the value of `old`.**

Explanation: The code `done.remove(old)` removes the value of `old` from the list `done`. All other variables (`old`, `r`, `a[r]`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. Since the length of `done` was already less than `k`, the condition for `ans` remains unchanged as well.
