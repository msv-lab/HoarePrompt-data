Output State: **`old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `r` is `m + 1`, `todo` does not contain the value of `old`, `done` now contains the value of `a[r]`, `done` either does not contain the value of `old` or contains it, `a[r]` is `a[m + 1]`, `extra`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `done.add(a[r])` adds the value of `a[r]` to the set `done`. Since `r` is `m + 1`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 1]`. All other variables (`old`, `todo`, `a[r - m]`, `extra`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
