Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `old` is removed from the `extra` list, `todo` is updated to remove `a[r]`, `done` now includes `a[r]`, `todo` and `extra` lists remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code adds `a[r]` to the `done` set. All other variables and lists remain unchanged from their previous states.
