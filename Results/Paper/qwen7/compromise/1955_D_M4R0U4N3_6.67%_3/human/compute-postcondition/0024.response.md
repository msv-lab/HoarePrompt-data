Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is a set containing `a[1]` or `a[0]` plus `a[j]`, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 2 or 3 depending on the condition. If `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `todo` has one less element, specifically `a[j]` is removed. Otherwise, `extra` is updated to contain `a[1]` or `a[0]` plus `a[j]`.**
