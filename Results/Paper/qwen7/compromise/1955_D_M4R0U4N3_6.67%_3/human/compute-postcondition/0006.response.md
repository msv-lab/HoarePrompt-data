Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for j in range(m):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.
   - `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split.
   - `done` is an empty set.
   - `extra` is an empty set.
   - `m` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is used as the upper limit for the range in the loop.

3. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop `for j in range(m)` to execute, `m` must be a positive integer (since `range(m)` generates numbers from 0 to `m-1`). If `m` is 0, the loop will not execute.
   - The value of `j` is not specified initially, but it will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `m` and `j`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `m` must be a positive integer, `j` is 0**
