Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The line `extra = set()` creates an empty set named `extra`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `a`, `todo`, or `done`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
