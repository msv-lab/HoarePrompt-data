Output State: **`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `old` is added to `todo`, `done` has had the element `old` removed.**

Explanation: The line `todo.add(old)` adds the variable `old` to the set `todo`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `r` is still `m + 1`, `m` is still less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is still greater than `m`. Additionally, `done` has had the element `old` removed, and `old` is now part of `todo`.
