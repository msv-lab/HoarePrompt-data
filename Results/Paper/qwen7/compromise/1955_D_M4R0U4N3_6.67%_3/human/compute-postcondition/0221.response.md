Output State: **`r` is `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, `n` is greater than `m`, `old` is not in `extra`, and `old` is in `done` and `old` is removed from `done`.**

Explanation: The code removes `old` from the `done` list. Since `old` was previously in `done`, after executing `done.remove(old)`, `old` is no longer in `done`. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged.
