Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split excluding `a[j]`, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is either an empty set or a set containing `a[0]`, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code removes `a[j]` from the set `todo`. Initially, `j` is 1. After executing `todo.remove(a[j])`, `j` increments by 1 (since it is not reassigned within the given code snippet), making `j` equal to 2. The value of `t`, `a`, `done`, `extra`, `m`, and the initial value of `j` are unchanged, but `todo` now excludes the element `a[j]`, which is `a[1]` (since `j` is now 2).
