Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is `m + 1`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `old` is no longer in the `done` list, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` lists remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k**.

This means that the `old` element, which was previously in the `done` list, has been removed from it. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
