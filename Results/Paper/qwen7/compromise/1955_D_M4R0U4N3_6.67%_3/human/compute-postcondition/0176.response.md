Output State: **`ans` is increased by 1, `r` is updated to `m + 2`, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `extra` list now contains the element `a[r]`**.

Explanation: The code `extra.add(a[r])` adds the element `a[r]` to the `extra` list. The other variables (`ans`, `r`, `old`) are updated according to the initial postconditions given. Since `r` is updated to `m + 2`, `old` is set to `a[r - m]`, which simplifies to `a[(m + 2) - m]` or `a[2]`. The `extra` list now includes the element `a[r]`.
