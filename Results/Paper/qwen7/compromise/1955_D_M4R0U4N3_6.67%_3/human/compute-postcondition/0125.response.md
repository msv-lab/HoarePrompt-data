Output State: **`r` is `m`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `old` is the value of `a[r - m]` and is no longer present in `extra`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `old` from the list `extra`. The values of `r`, `n`, `m`, and `old` remain the same, but `old` is no longer present in the list `extra`.
