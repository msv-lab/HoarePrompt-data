Output State: **`r` is `m`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `old` is not in `extra`, and `old` is in `done` but has been removed from `done`.**

Explanation: The code removes the value of `old` from the list `done`. Since `old` was previously in `done`, after executing `done.remove(old)`, `old` is no longer in the `done` list. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
