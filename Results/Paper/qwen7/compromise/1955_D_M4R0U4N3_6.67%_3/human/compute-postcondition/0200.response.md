Output State: **`j` is 1; `m` is greater than 0; `a[j]` is removed from the list `todo`; `done` contains the element `a[j]`.**

Explanation: The code adds the element `a[j]` (which is the same as `a[1]` since `j` is 1) to the set `done`. The list `todo` loses its `j`-th element, and the values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged.
