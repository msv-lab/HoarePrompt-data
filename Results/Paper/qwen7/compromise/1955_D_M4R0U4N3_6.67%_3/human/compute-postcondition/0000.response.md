Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder and typically discarded (not used in the loop body).
   - However, the loop itself depends on the value returned by `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is valid and non-zero.
   - The input value should be an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

3. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - We need to ensure that the input value is a valid integer within the specified range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, ensuring it is a valid integer within the given range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
