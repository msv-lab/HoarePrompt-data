Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0; `j` is equal to `m-1`; `todo` contains elements that were never in `a`; `done` contains elements from `a` that were moved from `todo` to `done`; `extra` contains elements from `a` that were never in `todo`.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; `a[r]` is either in `done` or `extra`; if `a[r]` is in `done`, then `len(done)` is greater than or equal to `k` and `ans` is increased by 1; if `a[r]` is in `extra`, then `a[r]` is not in `todo` and `old` is not in `extra` and `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is `m + 1`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` remains unchanged, `done` now includes the element `a[r - m]`, and `extra` remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` contains `a[r]`, and if `old` (which is `a[r - m]`) is in `extra`, then `extra` does not contain `old`. If `old` is in `done`, then `old` is added to `todo` and `done` has had the element `old` removed. If `old` is not in `done`, no changes are made to `todo` and `done`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than `m`; if `a[r]` is in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain the element `a[r]`, `extra` does not change, and `done` contains the element `a[r]`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `extra` now contains the element `a[r]`, and `ans` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
