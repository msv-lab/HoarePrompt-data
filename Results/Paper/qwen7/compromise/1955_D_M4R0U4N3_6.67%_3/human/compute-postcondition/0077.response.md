Postcondition: `ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`, `todo` now includes `old`, and `old` is removed from the `done` set, if `old` is in the `done` set. Otherwise, `ans` is incremented by 1, `r` is `m + 2`, `a[r]` is `a[m + 2]`, and `extra` may have a new element `a[m + 2]`.
