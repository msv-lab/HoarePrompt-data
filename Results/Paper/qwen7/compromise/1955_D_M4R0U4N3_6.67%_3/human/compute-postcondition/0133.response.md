Postcondition: `r` is `m`, `n` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, `m` is an integer from user input and is greater than 0, and `old` is the value of `a[r - m]`. If `old` is no longer present in `extra`, then `old` is either in `todo` and has been removed from `todo`, or `old` is not in `todo`. If `old` is still in `extra`, then `old` is in `todo`, and `old` is either in `done` but has been removed from `done`, or `old` is not in `done`.
