Output State: **`todo` is the set of integers from user input with `a[j]` removed, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `a` is updated with integers from the input, `m` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `a[j]` was in `todo`.**

This means that the element `a[j]` has been removed from the set `todo`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `ans` still holds based on the length of `done` relative to `k`.
