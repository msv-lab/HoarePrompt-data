Output State: **`ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `ans` is 0; `j` is equal to `m-1`; `todo` contains elements that were never in `a`; `done` contains elements from `a` that were moved from `todo` to `done`; `extra` contains elements from `a` that were never in `todo`.**

This means that the value of `ans` is determined by comparing the length of the list `done` with the integer `k`. If `done` has 5 or more elements (assuming `k` is 5), `ans` will be set to 1; otherwise, it will be set to 0. The values of `j`, `todo`, `done`, and `extra` remain as described in the initial state, with no changes from the provided code snippet.
