Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `todo` is a set containing integers from the input split, `done` is either a set containing `a[0]` or an empty set, `extra` is either a set containing `a[1]` or `a[0]`, `m` is a positive integer, `j` is 1 or 2 depending on the condition.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases: if `a[j]` is in `todo`, then `j` is set to 2 and `todo` excludes `a[j]`; otherwise, `j` remains 1 and `extra` is updated to contain `a[1]`.
