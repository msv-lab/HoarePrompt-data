Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `old` is equal to `a[r - m]`, `r` is `m + 1`, `done` either does not contain the value of `old` or contains it, `a[r]` is `a[m + 1]`, `extra` may have a new element `a[r]`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, then `todo` does not contain the value of `old`; otherwise, `todo` contains the value of `old` if `old` is in `extra`.**

In this output state, `ans` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values as described in the initial state.
