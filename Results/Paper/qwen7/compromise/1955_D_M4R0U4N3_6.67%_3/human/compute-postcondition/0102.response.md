Output State: **`todo` is the set of integers from user input with `a[j]` removed, `done` contains the element `a[j]`, `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, else 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from user input, and `a` is updated with integers from the input, `m` must be greater than 0.**

In this output state, the variable `done` has added the element `a[j]` to itself, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition for `ans` remains the same, depending on the length of `done` relative to `k`.
