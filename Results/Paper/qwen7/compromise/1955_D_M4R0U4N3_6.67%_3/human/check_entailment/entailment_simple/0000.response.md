Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly follows the logic to solve the problem. It initializes sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` to keep track of elements that need to be matched, those that have already been matched, and those that do not appear in `b`, respectively.
2. The program iterates through the array `a` using a sliding window approach. For each new element entering the window, it updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` accordingly.
3. The key logic is in the increment of `ans` when the size of `done` reaches or exceeds `k`. This ensures that we count all subarrays that meet the criteria.
4. The program handles edge cases where the initial segment of `a` might already satisfy the condition, and it correctly adjusts the sets as the window slides through `a`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided annotations.

Correctness: **True**
