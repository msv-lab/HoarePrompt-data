You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an integer `ans` based on the count of zeros and ones in the binary string `s`. The final output for each test case is the value of `ans`, which represents the number of valid subarrays under specific conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to sort a binary string by performing cyclic shifts on substrings and minimizing the total cost of these shifts.
2. **Reviewing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It converts the string `s` into a list of integers and counts the number of zeros in the string.
   - It initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string, updating the counter and calculating the cost based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.
   - However, the logic for calculating the cost does not seem to correctly implement the cyclic shift strategy required to sort the string.

3. **Analyzing the Logic**:
   - The variable `ans` is supposed to store the total cost.
   - The logic inside the loop where `ans` is updated seems flawed. Specifically, the condition `if c == 0: ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` and `else: ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` do not accurately reflect the cost calculation for cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to identify the longest prefix that is already sorted and calculate the cost of shifting the remaining part to its correct position.
   - The correct approach involves finding the longest prefix of 0s and then calculating the cost of shifting the rest of the string to the leftmost position.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
