Output State: **`ans` is 1, `c` is 0, `zeroes` is the count of 0s in the first element of `s`, and `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `ans` by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. Given the initial state, `cnt[c]` (where `c` is 0) is incremented by 1, but the value of `cnt[1]` is not specified and does not affect the increment of `ans` because `c` is 0. Therefore, `ans` remains 1, `c` stays 0, `zeroes` retains its count, and `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.
