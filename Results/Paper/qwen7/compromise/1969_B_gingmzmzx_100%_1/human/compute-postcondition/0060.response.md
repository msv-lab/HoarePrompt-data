Output State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt[0]` is 0, `cnt[1]` is 0, `c` is the last element in `s` after all iterations, `n` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` to 0. No changes are made to `cnt[0]`, `cnt[1]`, `c`, or `n` within the given code snippet. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values. The only change is that `n` is decremented by 1.
