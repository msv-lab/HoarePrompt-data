Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is updated based on whether `c` is 0, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, and `c` is either 0 or not 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. If true, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The values of `zeroes`, `cnt[c]`, `t`, `n`, and `c` are not directly affected by this line of code, so they retain their original conditions.
