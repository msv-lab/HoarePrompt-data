Output State: **`s` is 0**

The code `s = 0` simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `s`. Since no other operations are performed, the only change is to the variable `s`, which is now `0`. All other variables remain in their initial state, but since no other variables are mentioned, we only need to specify the change for `s`.
