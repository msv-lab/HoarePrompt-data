Output State: **`s` is 0, `list2` is [0], `list1` is a non-empty list of words from `b`**

Explanation: The code `list2.append(int(str))` appends the integer value of the string `str` (which is `0`) to the list `list2`. Since `str` is explicitly given as `0` in the initial state, `list2` becomes `[0]`. The values of `s` and `list1` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
