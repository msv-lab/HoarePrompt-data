Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input and returns it stripped of any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()` calls `func_1()` and returns an integer value, which is used to determine the number of test cases (`t`).
   - `func_3()` calls `func_1()` and splits the resulting string into integers, returning a list of these integers. This function is not directly used in the main logic but seems to be intended for parsing the input data.
   - `func_4()` initializes the necessary variables and processes the input for each test case.

2. **Main Logic in `func_4()`**:
   - It correctly initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - It iterates through each move, updating the set `ans` based on the distance `r` and the direction `c` (or '?' indicating both directions).
   - The logic for updating `ans` when `c` is '0' or '?' is correct, as it adds the clockwise and possibly counterclockwise positions to `temp`.
   - Similarly, the logic for updating `ans` when `c` is '1' or '?' is correct, as it subtracts the distance and possibly adds the counterclockwise position.
   - After processing all moves, it ensures that if `0` is in `ans`, it replaces it with `n` (since indices wrap around in a circular manner).
   - Finally, it prints the size of `ans` and the sorted elements of `ans`.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ x ≤ n) are handled appropriately.
   - The use of modulo `% n` ensures that the positions wrap around correctly in a circular manner.
   - The handling of '?' in the direction ensures that all possible positions are considered.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
