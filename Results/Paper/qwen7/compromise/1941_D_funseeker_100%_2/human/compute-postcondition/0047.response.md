Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for q in ans`. The variables involved in the loop head are `q` and `ans`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `ans`. At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `ans` must contain at least one element.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the presence of elements in `ans`, the loop will execute again if `ans` still contains at least one element.
   - For the loop to execute again, `ans` must still contain at least one element. 

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `ans`. It must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` must contain at least one element**.
