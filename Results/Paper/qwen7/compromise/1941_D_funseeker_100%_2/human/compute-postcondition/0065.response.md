Output State: **`ans` is equal to (`q - r`) % `n`, `temp` contains three elements which are (`q - r`) % `n`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()`**

Explanation: The code `r = int(r)` converts the string `r` into an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` is still equal to (`q - r`) % `n`, `temp` still contains three elements which are (`q - r`) % `n`, `r` is now an integer, and `c` is still a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()`.
