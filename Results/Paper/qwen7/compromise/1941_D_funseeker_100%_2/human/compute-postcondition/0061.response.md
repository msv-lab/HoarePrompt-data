Output State: **After all iterations, `ans` is empty, and `temp` contains three elements which are `(q - r) % n`, regardless of the value of `c`.**

Explanation: Given the loop continues to add elements to `temp` based on the value of `c` (either adding `(q - r) % n` or `(q + r) % n`), and since the loop continues to iterate over all elements in `ans`, each iteration adds one more element to `temp`. After the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The variable `temp` will contain three elements, all of which are `(q - r) % n`, as per the last described output state after 3 iterations, and this pattern would continue for any number of iterations, adding `(q - r) % n` each time.
