Output State: **`ans` contains all elements it was initialized with, `temp` is an empty set, `c` is either '1' or '?', `r` is now an integer value converted from the original string `r`.**

Explanation: The line `temp = set()` assigns an empty set to the variable `temp`. This operation does not affect the values of `ans`, `c`, or `r`. Therefore, `ans` retains its initial state, `temp` becomes an empty set, `c` remains either '1' or '?', and `r` stays as the integer value converted from the original string `r`.
