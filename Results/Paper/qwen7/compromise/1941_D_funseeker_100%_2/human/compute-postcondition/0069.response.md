Output State: **`ans` is not an empty set, `q` is the first element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing one element which is `(q + r) % n`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()` and its current value is either '0' or '?'**

Explanation: The code adds an element to the `temp` set, which is the result of `(q + r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `c` is not affected by this operation.
