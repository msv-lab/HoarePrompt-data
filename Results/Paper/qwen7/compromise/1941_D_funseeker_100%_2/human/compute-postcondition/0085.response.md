Postcondition: `ans` is a non-empty set with at least two elements, `q` is the third element in `ans`, `temp` is a set containing the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `r` is an integer, `c` is a string obtained from splitting the result of `func_1()`, and its value is either '1', '?', or '0'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` remains unchanged.
