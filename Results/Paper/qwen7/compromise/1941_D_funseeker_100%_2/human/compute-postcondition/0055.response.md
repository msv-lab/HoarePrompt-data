Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains an additional element which is `(q + r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code adds an element to the set `temp`. This element is the result of `(q + r) % n`, where `q` is the next element in `ans` and `r` is another variable (though its specific value is not given, it is used in the calculation). The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
