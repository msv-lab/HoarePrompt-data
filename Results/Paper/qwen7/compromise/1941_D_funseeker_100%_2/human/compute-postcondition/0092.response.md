Output State: **`ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws, and `temp` is equal to `ans` after the last iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., `m` times), the set `ans` will contain all the unique positions the ball can be in based on the operations performed within the loop. The variable `temp` will be updated in each iteration and will eventually hold the final state of `ans` after the loop ends. Since the loop iterates `m` times, and in each iteration, the ball's position is adjusted based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1()`, the final `ans` will include all possible positions the ball could end up in after `m` throws.
