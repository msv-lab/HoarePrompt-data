Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of cells.
   - It then reads a string of `n` characters where '0' indicates a free cell and '1' indicates a cell with a chip.

2. **Finding Positions of Chips:**
   - The program converts the input string to a single string by removing spaces using `split()` and `join()`.
   - It finds the index of the first '1' (chip) using `arr.find('1')`, storing this in `x`.
   - It finds the index of the last '1' (chip) from the right using `arr[::-1].find('1')`, storing this in `y`. Note that `[::-1]` reverses the string, so `y` is actually the distance from the end of the string to the last '1'.
   - It extracts the substring `z` from `x` to `n - y`.

3. **Counting Free Cells Between Chips:**
   - The program counts the number of '0's (free cells) in the substring `z` using `z.count('0')`.

4. **Output:**
   - The result of `z.count('0')` is printed for each test case.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Chip Positions:**
   - The logic to find the positions of the first and last chips is flawed. The program only considers the first and last chips but does not account for multiple chips in the middle.
   - The program assumes that moving the farthest chip to the left will solve the problem, which is not always true.

2. **Handling Multiple Chips:**
   - The program does not handle cases where there are multiple chips in the middle. It only considers the first and last chips, which might not be optimal.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Operations:**
   - The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. It simply counts the free cells between the first and last chips, which is not the correct approach.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all chips and ensure that they are moved optimally to form a single block. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        chips = [i + 1 for i, x in enumerate(arr) if x == 1]
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of operations
        min_operations = len(chips) - 1
        for i in range(len(chips) - 1):
            min_operations = min(min_operations, chips[i + 1] - chips[i] - 1)
        
        print(min_operations)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
