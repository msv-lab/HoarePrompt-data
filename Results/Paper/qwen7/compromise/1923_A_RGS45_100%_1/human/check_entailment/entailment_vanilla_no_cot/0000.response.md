Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Free Cells:**
   - The code finds the first occurrence (`x`) and the last occurrence (`y`) of '1' in the string representation of the array.
   - It then extracts the substring `z` between these positions and counts the zeros in this substring.
   - This approach is flawed because it doesn't account for the requirement to move chips to the closest free cell to the left. Instead, it just checks the number of zeros between the first and last chip positions.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Chip Movements:**
   - The problem requires moving chips to the closest free cell to the left until all chips are contiguous.
   - Simply counting zeros between the first and last chip positions does not reflect the actual number of moves required.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the first and last chip positions
        first_chip = None
        last_chip = None
        
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == 1:
                if first_chip is None:
                    first_chip = i
                last_chip = i
        
        # Count the number of operations needed
        operations = 0
        for i in range(first_chip + 1, last_chip + 1):
            if arr[i] == 0:
                operations += 1
        
        print(operations)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Finding Chip Positions:**
   - Iterate through the array to find the first and last positions of chips.
   
2. **Counting Operations:**
   - Count the number of free cells between the first and last chip positions, which represents the number of operations needed to move the chips contiguously.

This approach ensures that the solution correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to make all chips contiguous.
