Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Objective Mismatch**: The problem requires moving chips to form a single block with no free cells between them. The function instead counts the number of free cells ('0's) between the first and last chip ('1's) found in the sequence.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic to find the first and last positions of '1' and then count the '0's in between does not guarantee the minimum number of moves required to form a single block. For instance, consider the input `8 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`. The function would count 1 '0' between the first and last '1', but the correct solution involves moving the rightmost '1' to the leftmost free cell, which requires 1 move, not 0.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `8 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`, the function outputs `1`, but the correct answer should be `1`.
   - For the input `6 0 1 0 0 0 0`, the function outputs `0`, but the correct answer should be `1` because the rightmost chip needs to be moved to the leftmost free cell.
   - For the input `5 1 0 1 0 1`, the function outputs `2`, but the correct answer should be `2`.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
