State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute even once, `t` must be at least 1.
3. The initial state mentions that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since the loop head only involves the variable `t`, this is the only state that needs to be adjusted.
