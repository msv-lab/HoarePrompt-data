Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the initial state of the field and the movements. It correctly identifies players, goals, and the Quaffle's position.
2. **Player Movements**: The program updates player positions correctly using the `func_1` function, which adds movement vectors to the player's current position.
3. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is implemented correctly. When a player carries the Quaffle and reaches the opponent's goal, the appropriate team scores a point and the Quaffle returns to the center of the field.
4. **Output Format**: The program prints the correct events in the required format and outputs the final score at the end of the game.
5. **Edge Cases**: The provided examples cover various scenarios, including different team scores, correct and incorrect goals, and multiple steps. The program handles these cases correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
