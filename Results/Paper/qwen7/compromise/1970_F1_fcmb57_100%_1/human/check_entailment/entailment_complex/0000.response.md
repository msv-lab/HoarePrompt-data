Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the field and reads the necessary inputs.
2. The `func_1` function is defined to update the coordinates of a player based on the movement direction provided.
3. The program processes each action in the list of moves, updating the player positions and checking for scoring conditions.
4. The scoring logic is implemented correctly, printing "BLUE GOAL" or "RED GOAL" when a player scores in the opponent's goal.
5. The final score is printed at the end of the game.

Given the provided code and the annotated program, the logic appears to be sound and should work as intended according to the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly updates the player's position, and the main loop processes each action appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
