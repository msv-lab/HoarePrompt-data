Precondition: **a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a 2D list of strings, where each string contains M characters and there are N such strings. The list contains characters representing empty cells ('..'), players ('R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9'), goals ('RG', 'BG'), and the Quaffle ('.Q'). Additionally, the function takes a list of actions, where each action is a string describing the entity performing the action and the action itself (e.g., 'B2 U' for player B2 moving up).**
