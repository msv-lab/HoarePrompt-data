Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three integers n, a, and b. It returns a result based on the conditions specified for n, a, and b.**

This means the function likely takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains three integers (n, a, b), and it processes these test cases according to certain conditions and returns a result for each test case. However, since the exact conditions and the nature of the return value are not specified, the description focuses on the structure and nature of the input and the implied processing.
