Output State: **`cn` is increased by 1, the current value of `num` is such that the element at index `i` is equal to the element at index `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `cn` by 1. The condition that the element at index `i` is equal to the element at index `i + 1` remains unchanged. The value of `n` being greater than 0 is a precondition and is not affected by this line of code.
