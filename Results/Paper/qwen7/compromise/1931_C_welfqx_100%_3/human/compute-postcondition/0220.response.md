Output State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is either 1 or 2, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `ii` is `n-1`, `cn` is `ck + 1`**.

The value of `cn` is incremented by `ck`, which can be either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
