Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for j in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `j` is currently 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `f` is 0.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - `f` remains unchanged and is still 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `f` is 0**.
