Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is a value such that the loop runs `n - 1` times, `cn` is 1, and `num` is a list.**

Explanation: The variable `ck` is incremented by 1. Since `ck` was initially not mentioned, it is assumed to be the same as `cn`. Therefore, `cn` is updated to 1. The values of `ii`, `n`, and `num` remain unchanged.
