Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `n-2`.
   - The loop runs for `n-1` iterations.

3. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition is `range(n - 1)`, which means the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n-2` (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n-2`, after one iteration, `i` should become `n-3`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since `n-1` must be a non-negative integer).

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` should be `n-2` initially.
   - After one iteration, `i` should be `n-3`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 2.

Given these points, the final state to ensure the loop can execute is:

**State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `n` must be at least 2**
