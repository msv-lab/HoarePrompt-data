Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is 0, `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether any two consecutive elements in the list `num` are different, `num` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` remains unchanged, and `onum` is a copy of the original `num` list reversed; `ck` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `ck = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `ck`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
