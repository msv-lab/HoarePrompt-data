Output State: **The loop has executed `n-1` times. The variable `i` is now `n-1`. If any pair of consecutive elements in `num` from index 0 to `n-2` were found to be equal, the variable `cn` holds the count of such pairs. Otherwise, `cn` remains 0. The other variables (`j`, `f`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`) retain their initial values.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has checked each consecutive pair of elements in `num` up to the second last element. The variable `cn` will hold the count of how many times consecutive elements were found to be equal. All other specified variables (`j`, `f`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
