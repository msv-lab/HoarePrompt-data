Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is 0, `f` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether any two consecutive elements in the list `num` are different, `num` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `j` is `n - 2`, `n` remains unchanged, and `onum` is a copy of the original `num` list.**

Explanation: The code `onum = num.copy()` creates a copy of the list `num` and assigns it to the variable `onum`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only new variable introduced is `onum`, which is a copy of `num`.
