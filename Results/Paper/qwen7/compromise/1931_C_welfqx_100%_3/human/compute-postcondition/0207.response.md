Postcondition: `j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is either 1 or 2, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `ii` is `n-2`. If `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, then `ck` is set to 2. Otherwise, `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
