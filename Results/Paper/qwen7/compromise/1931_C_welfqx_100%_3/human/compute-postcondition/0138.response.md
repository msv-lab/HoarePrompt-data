Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `ii` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ii` is `n - 2`
   - `n` is an integer
   - `onum` is a list of integers

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `ii` to `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `ii` must be less than `n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `ii` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `ii` will be `n - 1`.
   - The condition `ii < n - 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Verify the condition**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `ii` is `n - 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `ii` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `ii` will be incremented to `n - 1` in the next iteration, and the condition `ii < n - 1` will still hold true as long as `n > 2`.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `ii` will be updated to `n - 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `onum` remains the same.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ii` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer, `onum` is a list of integers**
