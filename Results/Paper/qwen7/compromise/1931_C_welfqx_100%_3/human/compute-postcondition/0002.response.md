Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer within the specified range, and `r` remains 0 since no operations were performed on it.
