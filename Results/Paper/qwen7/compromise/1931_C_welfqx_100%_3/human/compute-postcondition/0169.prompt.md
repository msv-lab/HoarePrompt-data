Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cn` is incremented by `ck`, `n` is an input integer, `onum` is a list of integers, `ck` is incremented by 1 each time `onum[ii]` is equal to `onum[ii + 1] until a pair of consecutive elements are not equal or the end of the list is reached, and if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is further incremented by `ck`, `r` is `previous_r + 1`, and `r` must be less than `t`; `f` is 1, `num` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1):
    if num[j] != num[j + 1]:
        f = 0
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, and either the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or the first element of `num` is equal to the second element of `num`, and the conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and `f` is 0. If the element at index `j` in `num` is not equal to the element at index `j + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the element at index `j` in `num` is equal to the element at index `j + 1`, the conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `f` is 0. If `num[j]` is not equal to `num[j + 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
