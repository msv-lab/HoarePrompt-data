Output State: **`j` is `n-3`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, and `cn` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cn += 1` increments the value of `cn` by 1. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `j`, `f`, `onum`, `ck`, `symb1`, `symb2`, and the condition for `cn` remain unchanged from the initial state.
