Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - `j` should be initialized to 0 because the loop starts from 0 and goes up to `n-2`.
   - `n` should be at least 2 because `range(n - 1)` requires `n - 1` to be non-negative.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `j` should be set to 0.
   - The value of `n` should be at least 2 to ensure the loop can execute.

4. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - `cn`, `ck`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `r`, `f`, and `num` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
