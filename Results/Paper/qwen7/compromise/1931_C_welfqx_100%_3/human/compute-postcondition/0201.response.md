Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `ii` and `n-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `ii` is initialized to `n-2`.
   - The loop runs from `ii = 0` to `ii < n-1`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `ii` must be less than `n-1`.
   - Initially, `ii` is `n-2`, so the condition `ii < n-1` is true.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `ii` starts at `n-2` and the loop will continue as long as `ii < n-1`.
   - Since `ii` starts at `n-2`, it will increment in the loop body, and we need to ensure that it does not exceed `n-1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `ii` and `n`. Specifically, `ii` should be `n-2`, and `n` should be such that `ii < n-1` holds true initially.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`j` is `n-2`, `f` is 1, `onum` is the reverse of `num`, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is `num[0]`, `symb2` is `onum[0]`, `ii` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 2**
