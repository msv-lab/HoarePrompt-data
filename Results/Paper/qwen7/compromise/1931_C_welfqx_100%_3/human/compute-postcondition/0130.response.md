Output State: **`ii` is `n-1`, `n` must be an integer, and `onum[ii]` is not equal to `onum[ii + 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `ii`, `n`, or `onum`. It only indicates that the program exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
