Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code is flawed and does not ensure that the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal is calculated properly. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Operation of Finding Segments**: The code attempts to find segments where elements are the same but does not handle the operation of changing segments to a single value optimally. The approach to finding `cn` and `ck` does not account for the optimal way to perform the operation.

2. **Reverse Array Handling**: The reverse array handling (`onum`) is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem correctly. The goal is to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal, not to compare forward and backward segments.

3. **Cost Calculation**: The final cost calculation `n - max(cn, ck)` does not reflect the actual cost of operations needed to make all elements equal. This formula assumes that the longest segment of identical values can be changed in one operation, which is not always the optimal strategy.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to identify the most frequent element in the array and calculate the minimum cost to change all other elements to this most frequent element. This involves counting the frequency of each element and determining the minimum cost based on these counts.
