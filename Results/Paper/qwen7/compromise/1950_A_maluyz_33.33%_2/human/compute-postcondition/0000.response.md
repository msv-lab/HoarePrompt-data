Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, after executing the code, `t` will still be within this range, but its specific value will depend on the user's input. The other conditions and constraints on `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged and are not affected by this code snippet.
