Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits (`a`, `b`, `c`).
3. It checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`), a peak (`a < b > c`), and handles the case where all three digits are equal (`a == b == c`).
4. The logic for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak is correct:
   - For a stair, the condition `a < b < c` is checked directly.
   - For a peak, the condition `a < b > c` should be checked, but the current code incorrectly uses `max(a, b, c) == b`. This will not always be correct because it does not account for the strict inequality `a < b > c`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NONE".

However, there is a mistake in the peak condition check. The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` does not correctly represent the peak condition `a < b > c`. To fix this, we need to check both `a < b` and `b > c`.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, the peak condition should be checked as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This corrected version ensures that the peak condition is accurately checked.
