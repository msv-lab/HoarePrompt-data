Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the middle digit \(b\) is greater than both \(a\) and \(c\), which should result in a "PEAK". Specifically, the program checks if the maximum value among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is \(b\), but it does not correctly handle the scenario where \(b\) is the peak. For example, if the input is `4 5 3`, the program will incorrectly output "NONE" instead of "PEAK".
