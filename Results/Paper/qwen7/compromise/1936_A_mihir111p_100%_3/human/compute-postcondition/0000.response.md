Based on the initial state provided, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c, d < n\), where \(n\) is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^4\). The print statement is:

```python
print('?', a, b, c, d)
```

The output will be a string that includes the character '?' followed by the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

Output: **'? [a] [b] [c] [d]' (where [a], [b], [c], and [d] are the respective values of the variables a, b, c, and d, which are non-negative integers less than n)**
