Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

1. **Initialization and Query Handling**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes `ans1` to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) and uses the function `func_1` to compare `(p_ans1 | p_i)` with `(p_ans1 | p_i)`. This is essentially comparing the same values, which doesn't provide useful information. This part seems redundant and incorrect.

2. **Finding Maximum OR Value**:
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to `[0]`.
   - It iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_mx | p_ans1)` with `(p_i | p_ans1)`.
     - If the result is `<`, it resets `v` to an empty list and sets `mx` to `i` and appends `i` to `v`.
     - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `v`.
   - This step aims to find the index `i` that maximizes the OR value with `ans1`.

3. **Selecting Indices for Maximum XOR**:
   - The program selects the first element of `v` as `mx` and `ans` as the first element of `v`.
   - It then iterates through the rest of the elements in `v` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_ans | p_ans)` with `(p_v[i] | p_v[i])`.
     - If the result is `>`, it updates `ans` to `v[i]`.
   - Finally, it prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the result.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Redundant Comparison**:
   - The first loop where `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)` is called is redundant and does not provide any useful information. It should be removed.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Maximum OR**:
   - The logic for finding the maximum OR value is flawed. The program should compare different indices to find the maximum OR value, but the current implementation only compares the same indices repeatedly.

3. **Incorrect XOR Calculation**:
   - The final selection of indices for maximum XOR is based on the OR comparison, which is not directly related to the XOR operation. The program needs to ensure that the selected indices maximize the XOR value.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to find the indices that maximize the XOR value. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
