Output State: **`numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of input integers with the first element removed, `b` is the first element of the original `numbers` list, `suma` is `suma + min(a, b)`, `a` is the second element of the original `numbers` list, `numbers` is a non-empty list, `a` is now the first element of `numbers`.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the `numbers` list and assigns it to `a`. Since `numbers` was a non-empty sorted list before the pop operation, after popping the first element, `numbers` remains a non-empty list. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
