Output State: **`numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of input integers with the first element removed, `b` is the first element of the original `numbers` list, `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `a` is the second element of the original `numbers` list.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the `numbers` list and assigns it to `b`. Since `numbers` was a non-empty sorted list with the first element removed, popping the first element means `b` now holds the first element of the original `numbers` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
