Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` contains at least one less element, `suma` is 0, `a` is the first element of `numbers` before popping, `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping.**

Explanation: The code pops the first element from the list `numbers` and assigns it to `b`. The precondition that `a` is the first element of `numbers` before popping is now updated to say that `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping. All other variables remain unchanged.
