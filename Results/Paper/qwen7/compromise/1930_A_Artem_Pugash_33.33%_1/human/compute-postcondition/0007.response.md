Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list with one less element, `suma` is 0, `a` is the first element of `numbers` before popping.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `a`. The precondition that `numbers` must not be an empty list ensures that there is at least one element to pop. After popping, the length of `numbers` decreases by one. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
