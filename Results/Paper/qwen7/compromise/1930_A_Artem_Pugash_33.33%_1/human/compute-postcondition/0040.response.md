Output State: `numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is the final iteration count, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of `min(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `numbers` will be an empty list since each element was popped off during each iteration. The variable `suma` will hold the cumulative sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers taken from the `numbers` list during each iteration of the loop. The value of `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed, which is determined by the length of the original `numbers` list divided by 2 (since two elements are processed per iteration).
