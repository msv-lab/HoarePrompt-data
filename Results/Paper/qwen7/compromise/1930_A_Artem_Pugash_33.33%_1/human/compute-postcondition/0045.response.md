Output State: **`numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a sorted list of input integers, `suma` is the sum of `min(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop, where `a` and `b` are elements from `numbers`.**

Explanation: The code `numbers.sort(reverse=False)` sorts the list `numbers` in ascending order (since `reverse=False` is the default behavior). The other variables (`numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, and `suma`) remain unchanged.
