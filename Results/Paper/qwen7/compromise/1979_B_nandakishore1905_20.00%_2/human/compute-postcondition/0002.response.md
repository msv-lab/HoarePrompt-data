Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided in the loop body. For each test case, the output will be either `k`, `1`, `2`, or `k - q` depending on the values of `n` and `m`. Here, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `q` is calculated as \(2^{(p-1)}\) where `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
