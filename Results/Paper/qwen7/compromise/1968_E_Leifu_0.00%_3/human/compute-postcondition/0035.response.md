Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - After the if-else block, `j` will be `n + 1`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is determined by the input and not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `t` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer**.
