Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `4` to `n` (inclusive). This means the loop continues as long as `j < n + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 4.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been equal to `n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `n` must still be at least 5 for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be at least 5**
