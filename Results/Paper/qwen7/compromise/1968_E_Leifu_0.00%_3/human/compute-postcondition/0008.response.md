The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer and it is not equal to 3.

The `print('2 4')` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `i`, and `n`. It simply prints the string `'2 4'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2 4**
