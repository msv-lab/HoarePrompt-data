Output State: `n` must be at least 8.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` must be at least 8. This is because the loop starts from `j = 4` and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`. For the loop to execute 3 times (as per the given information), `n` must be at least 5. To find out how many times the loop can execute when `n` is at least 8, we can see that starting from `j = 4`, the loop will execute `8 - 4 + 1 = 5` times. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` must be at least 8.
