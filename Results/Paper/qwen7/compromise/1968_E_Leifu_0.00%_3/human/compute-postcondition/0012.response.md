Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be at least 5.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

However, there is no definition or initialization of the variable `j` in the provided initial state. Since `j` is not defined, it cannot be determined what value it holds. Therefore, the print statement will raise a NameError if executed directly because `j` is not defined.

Given this situation, the precise answer would be:

Output: **NameError: name 'j' is not defined**
