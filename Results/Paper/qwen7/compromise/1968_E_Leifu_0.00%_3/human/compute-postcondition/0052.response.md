Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 50 and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, it performs some unspecified operation and returns the result accordingly.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers (t and n), and validate them against given constraints before processing and returning a result.
