### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step to verify if it correctly maximizes the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all given \(n\).

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` as input, representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, which represents the size of the grid.

2. **Output Generation:**
   - The program always prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - If `n` is 3, it additionally prints `(2, 3)`.
   - For `n > 3`, it prints `(2, 4)` and then a series of coordinates from `(4, 4)` to `(n, n)`.

3. **Analysis for Different Values of \(n\):**

   - **For \(n = 2\):**
     - The program prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
     - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1\}\).
     - This is correct since the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2.

   - **For \(n = 3\):**
     - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.
     - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
     - This is correct since the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3.

   - **For \(n > 3\):**
     - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and then pairs \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).
     - Let's verify if this configuration maximizes \(\mathcal{H}\):
       - Distances involving `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \(\{0, 1\}\).
       - Distances involving `(2, 4)` and other points: \(\{2, 3, 4, \ldots, n-1\}\).
       - Distances involving points \((j, j)\): \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).
     - Combining these, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) includes all distances from 0 to \(n-1\), ensuring the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(n\).

However, upon closer inspection, the configuration provided by the program might not always maximize \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n > 3\). Specifically, consider the following counterexample:

- **For \(n = 4\):**
  - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, `(4, 4)`.
  - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
  - The set \(\mathcal{H}\) only includes \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4, but we can achieve a larger set by using different configurations.

A better configuration for \(n = 4\) would be:
- Print `(1, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, `(4, 1)`, `(4, 3)`.
- The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 2, 3, 4\}\), which has a size of 4.

Thus, the program does not always generate the optimal configuration for maximizing \(\mathcal{H}\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not always generate the optimal configuration to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).
