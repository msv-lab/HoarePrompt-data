Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the maximum number of points you can get by making optimal moves, given that Nene will also make optimal moves to maximize her score and minimize yours.
2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - The function `func_1` is called to compute the result for each test case.
   - In `func_1`, a dictionary `count_a` is used to count the occurrences of each card in your hand.
   - The function then iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if they exist in `count_a`. If a number exists and its count is 2, it increments the `max_score`.
3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly counts how many unique numbers are present in your hand with two cards.
   - However, this approach does not account for the optimal strategy of both players. Specifically, it assumes that you can always play a card that will give you a point, which is not necessarily true because Nene will try to minimize your score.
   - The current implementation does not simulate the turns or consider Neneâ€™s optimal strategy. Instead, it only checks the initial distribution of cards in your hand.

Given the problem statement, the provided solution does not correctly simulate the game or account for Nene's optimal strategy. Therefore, the code does not accurately determine the maximum number of points you can get.

Correctness: **False**
