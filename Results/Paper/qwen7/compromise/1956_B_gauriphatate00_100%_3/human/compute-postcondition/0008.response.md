Output State: **The program returns max_score, which is the number of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly twice in the list 'a'.**

This means the program returns the value of `max_score`, which was calculated as the count of integers from 1 to n that appeared exactly twice in the list `a`. The variable `count_a` remains unchanged, still holding the counts of how many times each unique integer appears in the list `a`.
