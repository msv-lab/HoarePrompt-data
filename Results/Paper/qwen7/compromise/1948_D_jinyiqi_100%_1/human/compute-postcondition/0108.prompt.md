Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is the length of the list `s`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n - j):
        if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        if count == j:
            print(count * 2)
            return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop has completed all its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop will continue executing as long as `n` is greater than `j + count - 1`. Once `count` equals `j`, it prints `count * 2` and returns, thus ending the loop. If the loop completes without hitting the condition `count == j`, then `count` will be equal to `n - j` if all characters from `k` to `n-1` satisfy the conditions in each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `n` is `N`, `j` is `J - 1`, `count` is either incremented by 1 each time the conditions `s[k] == '?'`, `s[k + j] == '?'`, or `s[k] == s[k + j]` are true, or reset to 0 if none of these conditions are met during any iteration of the loop, and `N - (J - 1)` is greater than 0.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` remains `N`, `j` remains `J - 1`, and `count` will reflect the total number of times the conditions `s[k] == '?'`, `s[k + j] == '?'`, or `s[k] == s[k + j]` were true across all iterations of the loop. The variable `count` is reset to 0 whenever it reaches `j`, at which point `count * 2` is printed and the function returns, effectively stopping the loop. If `N - (J - 1)` is still greater than 0, the loop continues until there are no more elements to check.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
