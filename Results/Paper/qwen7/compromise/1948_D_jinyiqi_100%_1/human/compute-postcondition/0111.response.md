Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It may return `None`, count which is 2, k which is 1, and n which is greater than j, or count which is 3, depending on the internal logic of the function. If there is no return statement, it does not return any value.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any parameters. Depending on the internal logic of the function, it might return specific values like `count` being 2, `k` being 1, and `n` being greater than `j`, or simply `count` being 3. If the function does not contain a return statement, it will not return any value.
