Postcondition: `k` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `j` must be at least 1, and `count` is 0 because the character at index `k` in string `s` is neither a question mark nor is the character at index `k + j` in string `s` a question mark, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`.
