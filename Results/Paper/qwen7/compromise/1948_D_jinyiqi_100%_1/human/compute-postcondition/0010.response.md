Postcondition: `k` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `j` must be at least 1, and `count` is 1 if the character at index `k` in string `s` is either a question mark or the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is a question mark or the character at index `k` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`. Otherwise, `count` is 0.
