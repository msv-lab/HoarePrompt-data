The function `func_1` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The function checks for pairs of characters in the string that are either equal or both question marks, starting from the middle of the string and moving towards the beginning. For each possible pair distance (from half the string length down to 1), it counts how many such valid pairs exist. If it finds a valid pair distance where the count equals the distance, it prints the count doubled and exits. If no such distance is found, it prints 0.
