The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, where each test case consists of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (with \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\)). For each test case, it calculates the value of \(ans\) as \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2\) and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated value for each case.
