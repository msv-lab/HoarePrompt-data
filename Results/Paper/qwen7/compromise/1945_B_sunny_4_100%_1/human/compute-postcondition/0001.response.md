Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and t is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is preserved, and now we know the exact value of `t` after the input operation. All other variables (`A`, `B`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `m/a`, `m/b`) are not yet defined or modified, so their states remain as part of the initial conditions.
