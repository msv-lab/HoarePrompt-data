### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, given the launch frequencies of two installations and the visibility period of each firework.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` representing the frequency of launching for the first and second installations and the visibility time of each firework, respectively.
   - The calculation of the number of fireworks visible is done using the formula `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`.

3. **Formula Analysis**:
   - `m // a` gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period.
   - `m // b` gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period.
   - Adding `+2` accounts for the possibility of fireworks being launched exactly at the start and end of the visibility period, ensuring that these fireworks are counted even if they overlap at the boundaries.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The formula handles edge cases where the visibility period might align perfectly with the launch intervals.
   - The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that we get whole numbers of fireworks, which is appropriate since we cannot have a fraction of a firework.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Let's verify the formula step-by-step:
     - Consider the visibility period `m` and the launch intervals `a` and `b`.
     - The number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period is `m // a`.
     - Similarly, the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period is `m // b`.
     - Adding `+2` accounts for the possibility of fireworks being launched exactly at the start and end of the visibility period, ensuring that these fireworks are counted even if they overlap at the boundaries.
     - This formula correctly accounts for the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time because it considers all possible overlaps and boundary conditions.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example input:
     - Test Case 1: `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`
       - `m // a = 4 // 6 = 0`
       - `m // b = 4 // 7 = 0`
       - `ans = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2`
     - Test Case 2: `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `m = 10`
       - `m // a = 10 // 3 = 3`
       - `m // b = 10 // 4 = 2`
       - `ans = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7`
     - Test Case 3: `a = 7`, `b = 8`, `m = 56`
       - `m // a = 56 // 7 = 8`
       - `m // b = 56 // 8 = 7`
       - `ans = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17`
     - Test Case 4: `a = 5`, `b = 6`, `m = 78123459896`
       - `m // a = 78123459896 // 5 = 15624691979`
       - `m // b = 78123459896 // 6 = 13020576649`
       - `ans = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630`
     - Test Case 5: `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `m = 1`
       - `m // a = 1 // 1 = 1`
       - `m // b = 1 // 1 = 1`
       - `ans = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`
     - Test Case 6: `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `m = 1000000000000000000`
       - `m // a = 1000000000000000000 // 1 = 1000000000000000000`
       - `m // b = 1000000000000000000 // 1 = 1000000000000000000`
       - `ans = 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002`
