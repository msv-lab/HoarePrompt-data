Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. This involves understanding the timing of the fireworks from both installations and their visibility period.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` which represent the frequency of launching for the first and second installations and the visibility time of each firework, respectively.
   - The calculation of the number of fireworks visible is done using the formula `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`.

3. **Formula Analysis**:
   - `m // a` gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period.
   - `m // b` gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period.
   - Adding `+2` accounts for the possibility of fireworks being launched exactly at the start and end of the visibility period, ensuring that these fireworks are counted even if they overlap at the boundaries.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The formula handles edge cases where the visibility period might align perfectly with the launch intervals.
   - The use of integer division (`//`) ensures that we get whole numbers of fireworks, which is appropriate since we cannot have a fraction of a firework.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided example outputs match the expected results based on the given logic.
   - The formula accounts for all possible overlaps and boundary conditions correctly.

Conclusion:
The given program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
