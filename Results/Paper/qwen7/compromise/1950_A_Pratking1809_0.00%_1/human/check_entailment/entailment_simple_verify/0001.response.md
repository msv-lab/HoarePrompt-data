### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `q` from the input.
   - The variable `mn` is initialized to 100 but is not used in the logic. This variable can be safely removed as it does not affect the program's functionality.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - The loop iterates `q` times, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.
   - The conditions to check whether the digits form a stair or a peak are correctly implemented.

3. **Conditions for Stair and Peak**:
   - The condition `if a < b < c:` checks if the digits form a stair.
   - The condition `if a < b > c:` checks if the digits form a peak.
   - However, the order of these conditions is problematic. The second condition `if a < b > c:` should come after the first condition `if a < b < c:` because the first condition already checks if `a < b`. If the first condition is true, there is no need to check the second condition again since `a < b` is already satisfied.

4. **Output**:
   - The output for each test case is correctly printed according to the conditions, but the order of the conditions can lead to incorrect results if both conditions are false.

### Analysis:
- The logic for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak is almost correct.
- The issue lies in the order of the conditions. If both conditions are false, the program should print "NONE". However, due to the order of the conditions, if the first condition is true, the second condition is not checked, and vice versa. This can lead to incorrect outputs in certain cases.

### Example:
Consider the input `1 2 3`:
- The first condition `if a < b < c:` is true, so it prints "STAIR".
- The second condition `if a < b > c:` is not checked because the first condition is true.

Now consider the input `1 2 1`:
- The first condition `if a < b < c:` is false.
- The second condition `if a < b > c:` is true, so it prints "PEAK".
- However, this input should print "NONE" because it does not satisfy either condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the order of the conditions, which can lead to incorrect outputs in some cases.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
