### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to determine if three digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a stair, a peak, or neither.
- A stair is defined as \(a < b < c\).
- A peak is defined as \(a < b > c\).

#### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It checks if \(a < b < c\) and prints 'STAIR' if true.
- It checks if \(a < b > c\) and prints 'PEAK' if true.
- If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.

#### Original Assessment:
- The assessment states that the program does not handle the case where `b` is equal to either `a` or `c`.
- This leads to incorrect outputs for certain inputs, such as `1 5 3`, which should be classified as "PEAK".

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment is inaccurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Stair Condition**: The program correctly checks \(a < b < c\) and prints 'STAIR' if true.
2. **Peak Condition**: The program correctly checks \(a < b > c\) and prints 'PEAK' if true.
3. **Else Condition**: The program prints 'NONE' if neither of the above conditions is met.

In the case of `1 5 3`:
- \(a = 1\)
- \(b = 5\)
- \(c = 3\)

The program checks:
- \(1 < 5 < 3\) is false.
- \(1 < 5 > 3\) is true.

Since the second condition is true, the program correctly prints 'PEAK'.

The program does not need to check for equality conditions (`b == a` or `b == c`) because the problem description explicitly states strict inequalities (`<` and `>`). Therefore, the program behaves as expected according to the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the given function summary.
