Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` takes an integer `q` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It initializes `mn` with a value of 100, but this variable is never used within the function, so it can be safely ignored.
3. The function then iterates over `q` test cases.
4. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
5. It checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is true.
6. It checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is true.
7. If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

Given the problem statement, the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK" are correctly implemented:
- A stair is determined by `a < b < c`.
- A peak is determined by `a < b > c`.

The logic in the code matches the problem requirements. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code based on the provided problem description and example.

Correctness: **True**
