Output State: **`k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp`**.

Explanation: The variable `sp` is incremented by the value of `a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
