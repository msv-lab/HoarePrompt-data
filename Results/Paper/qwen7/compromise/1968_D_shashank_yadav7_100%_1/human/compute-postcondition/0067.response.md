Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop will iterate from `0` to `n-1`. Therefore, `i` will start at `n` and decrement by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `0`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n`, the loop will not execute because `i` is already `n` and the loop condition `i < n` will be false initially.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must start at `0` or less than `n`.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `i` starts at `0` and `n` remains as an input integer.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer**
