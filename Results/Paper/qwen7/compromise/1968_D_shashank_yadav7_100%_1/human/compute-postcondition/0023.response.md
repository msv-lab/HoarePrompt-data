Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is -1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `s` is `p[s]` - 1
   - `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`
   - `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`
   - `sp` is `sp` + `a[s]`
   - `bp` is `bp` + `a[b]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was -1 at the end of the previous iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - The states of `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain the same since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `sp` + `a[s]`, `bp` is `bp` + `a[b]`**
