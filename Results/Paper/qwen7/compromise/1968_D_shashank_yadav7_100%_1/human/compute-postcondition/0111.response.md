Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an integer.
- `b` is defined as `p[b] - n`.
- `s` is defined as `p[s] - n`.
- `bm` is updated to be the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`.
- `sm` is updated to be the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.
- `sp` is updated to be `a[s] + sp + n * a[s]`.
- `bp` is updated to be `a[b] + bp + n * a[b]`.
- `i` is set to `n`.
- `(bm >= sm)` is a boolean condition.

The `print('Draw')` statement simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
