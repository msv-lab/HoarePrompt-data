Output State: **`i` is 1; `k` is decreased by 1**

The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `k` is decreased by 1, but since `k` was not initially defined, we can only say that `k` is decreased by 1 without specifying its exact value. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
