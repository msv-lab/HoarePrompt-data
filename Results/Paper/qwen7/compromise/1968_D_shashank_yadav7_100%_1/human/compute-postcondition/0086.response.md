Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by taking the maximum value between its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. Given the initial conditions, the values of `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sp`, `bp`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `sm` is updated based on the new expression `a[s] * k + sp`. The other variables and the condition of being broken out of the most internal loop or if statement remain the same.
