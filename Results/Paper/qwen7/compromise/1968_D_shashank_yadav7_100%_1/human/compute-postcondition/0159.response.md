Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`, `sp` is `sp + 2 * a[s]`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be incremented to `n + 1` because it starts at `n` and increments by 1 each iteration until `k` reaches 0. The variable `k` will be 0 since it decreases by 1 each iteration and the loop breaks when `k` equals 0. The variable `b` will be `p[b] - 2` and `s` will be `p[s] - 2` because they are decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The variables `sm` and `bm` are updated in each iteration, with `sm` being the maximum of itself and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, and `bm` being the maximum of itself and `a[b] * k + bp`. The variable `bp` is updated by adding `a[b]` twice (once per iteration) and `sp` is updated by adding `a[s]` twice (once per iteration).
