Output State: **`i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `bm` is the maximum value of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` after `n` iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` after `n` iterations, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` added `n` times to `sp`, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` added `n` times to `bp`, `t` must be greater than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers and splits them into a list using `map(int, input().split())`. This changes the value of `p` to a list of integers. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `t`, and `n`) are updated to new values (either an input integer or 0), except for `i` which remains unchanged as it was already set to `n`.
