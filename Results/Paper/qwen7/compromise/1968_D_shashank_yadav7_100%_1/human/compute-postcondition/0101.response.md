Output State: `k` is -`n`, `b` is `p[b] - n`, `s` is `p[s] - n`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + n * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + n * a[b]`, `i` is `n`.

In this final state after all iterations of the loop, `k` has been decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `-n`. The indices `b` and `s` have been updated `n` times according to the rules inside the loop, resulting in `p[b] - n` and `p[s] - n` respectively. The variable `bm` keeps track of the maximum value between its current value and `a[b] * k + bp` after each iteration, and similarly, `sm` tracks the maximum value between its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. The `sp` variable accumulates the sum of `a[s]` `n` times, and `bp` accumulates the sum of `a[b]` `n` times. The loop counter `i` starts from `n` and gets incremented by 1 for each iteration, reaching `n` after `n` iterations.
