Output State: **`k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + 2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + a[b]`, `i` is `i_prev + 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the loop or conditional block it is inside. Therefore, the values of `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only effect is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block it was in.
