Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 1`, where `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is 0.
- `b` is `p[b] - 2`, but since `b` is not defined in terms of any other variables, we cannot determine its exact value without knowing `p[b]`.
- `s` is `p[s] - 2`, similarly, we cannot determine its exact value without knowing `p[s]`.
- `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, but since `k` is 0, this simplifies to `sm` being the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] + sp + a[s]` or `sm` and `2 * a[s] + sp`.
- `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, which simplifies to `bm` being the maximum of `bm` and `bp` since `k` is 0.
- `bp` is `bp + 2 * a[b]`, so `bp` increases by `2 * a[b]`.
- `sp` is `sp + 2 * a[s]`, so `sp` increases by `2 * a[s]`.
- The condition `bm < sm` is true.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('Sasha')
```

The output will be the string 'Sasha'.

Output: **Sasha**
