Output State: **`k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`).**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sm` to be the maximum value between its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. Given that `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[s] * 0 + sp`, which is just `sp`. Therefore, `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `sp`. The other variables (`k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
