Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1**.

This means that the value of `k` is decremented by 1 from its previous value. All other variables retain their previous relationships and values as described in the initial state, with the additional detail that `sp` is now increased by the value of `a[s]`.
