Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n)` statement. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial values of `i` and `n`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop condition is `i < n`, the next value of `i` will be `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **State the new state**: Based on the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
