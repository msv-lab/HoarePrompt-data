Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is the same as before, `sm` is the same as before, `bm` is the same as before, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`.**

Explanation: The code `b = p[b] - 1` updates the value of `b` by subtracting 1 from `p[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
