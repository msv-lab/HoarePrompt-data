Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n + t - 1`, `k` will be 0, `b` will be `p[b] - 2^t`, `s` will be `p[s] - 2^t`, `bm` will be the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` after `n * t` iterations, `sm` will be the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` after `n * t` iterations, `sp` will be the sum of `a[s]` added `n * t` times to `sp`, `bp` will be the sum of `a[b]` added `n * t` times to `bp`, and either `bm` will be greater than `sm` or `bm` will be greater than or equal to `sm` after the if-else block executes.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will have incremented by one for each iteration of the outer loop, resulting in `i` being `n + t - 1`. The variables `k`, `b`, and `s` will have been adjusted according to the operations within the inner loop, specifically `b` and `s` will be reduced by `2^t` due to the repeated decrement by `1` in the inner loop for `n * t` times. The variables `bm` and `sm` will hold the maximum values calculated during the iterations, considering the contributions of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, while `sp` and `bp` will accumulate the sums of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, scaled by the number of iterations. The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` will determine the outcome of the loop, printing 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the result.
