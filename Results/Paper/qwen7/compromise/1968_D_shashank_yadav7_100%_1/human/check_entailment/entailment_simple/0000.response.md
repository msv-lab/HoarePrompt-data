Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are correctly initialized and adjusted to zero-based indexing. This is important because the indices in the lists `p` and `a` are expected to be zero-based.

3. **Game Logic**: The core logic of the game is implemented in the nested loop. The program calculates the scores for both players after `k` turns. Here's a breakdown of the logic:
   - `bm` and `sm` store the best possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - The loop iterates up to `k` times, updating the positions of both players (`b` and `s`) and recalculating their scores.
   - The maximum possible scores are updated using the formula `a[x] * (k - remaining_turns) + current_score`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where the game ends early (`k == 0`). In such cases, it directly compares the initial scores.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm`.

6. **Final State**: The final state of the program matches the expected behavior. The variables `b` and `s` will be out of bounds after `2^t` iterations due to the nested loop structure, but this does not affect the correctness of the output since the game logic is based on the scores calculated within the loop.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
