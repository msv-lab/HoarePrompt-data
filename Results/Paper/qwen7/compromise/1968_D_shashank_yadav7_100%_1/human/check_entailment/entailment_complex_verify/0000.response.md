### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Initial Assessment Breakdown:

1. **Score Calculation**:
   - The original assessment claims that the program incorrectly updates the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha.
   - The assessment states that the program uses `bm` and `sm` to store the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, but the way these scores are updated is incorrect.

2. **Position Update**:
   - The assessment mentions that the program subtracts 1 from the positions before updating the scores, which is unnecessary and incorrect because the positions are already 0-indexed.

3. **Score Calculation Logic**:
   - The assessment notes that the program incorrectly multiplies the remaining turns by the current score, which is not the correct approach for simulating the game.

#### Corrected Version Provided:

The corrected version provided in the original assessment is as follows:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        
        # Calculate initial scores
        bodya_score = a[b]
        sasha_score = a[s]
        
        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k):
            # Bodya's move
            b = p[b]
            bodya_score += a[p[b-1]]
            
            # Sasha's move
            s = p[s]
            sasha_score += a[p[s-1]]
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

#### Analysis of the Corrected Version:

1. **Initial Scores**:
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are correctly calculated using `a[b]` and `a[s]`.

2. **Position Update**:
   - The positions are updated correctly using `p[b]` and `p[s]`. There is no need to subtract 1 since the positions are already 0-indexed.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The scores are updated correctly for each turn. The score for Bodya is updated by adding `a[p[b-1]]`, and the score for Sasha is updated by adding `a[p[s-1]]`.

4. **Game Simulation**:
   - The game is simulated for `k` turns, and the final scores are compared to determine the winner.

Given the analysis, the corrected version provided in the original assessment accurately simulates the game according to the problem description. The original assessment was correct in identifying the issues with the initial program, and the provided corrected version addresses those issues effectively.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program, when corrected as provided, is now correct and accurately simulates the game as described in the problem statement.
