Output State: **`b_freq` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in list `b`, `a` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length m such that m <= n, `k` is an integer satisfying 1 <= k <= m, `good_subarrays` is 0.**

The code `b_freq = Counter(b)` creates a `Counter` object that stores the frequency of each element in the list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
