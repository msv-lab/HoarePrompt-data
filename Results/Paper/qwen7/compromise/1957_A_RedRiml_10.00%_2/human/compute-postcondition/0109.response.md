Output State: **`shapes` is increased by the number of times the condition `d[j] >= 3` is satisfied for each `j` in `pl` during the previous iteration, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `pl` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `pl`. This does not affect the values of `shapes`, `w`, `ln`, or `palka`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
