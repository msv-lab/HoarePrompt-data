Output State: **`shapes` is increased by the number of times the condition `d[j] >= 3` is satisfied for each `j` in `pl` during the previous iteration, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers named `palka`. The values of `shapes`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged from their initial state.
