Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the last element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the last element of `palka`, `d[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the index `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `i` is the last element of the list `palka`, `d[i]` is now 1. The other variables (`palka`, `i`, and `pl`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
