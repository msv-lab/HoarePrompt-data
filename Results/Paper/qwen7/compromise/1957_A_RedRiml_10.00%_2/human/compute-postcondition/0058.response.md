Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in palka:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `palka` is a list of integers entered by the user split from input().
   - `i` is the variable used to iterate over each element in `palka`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `palka`. If `palka` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `palka` is a list of integers, we need to ensure that it contains at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will be the first element of `palka` when the loop starts.

5. **Consider other relevant states**:
   - `shapes` is 3, but this is not directly related to the loop execution.
   - `d` is an empty dictionary, which is not relevant to the loop execution.
   - `pl` is an empty list, which is not relevant to the loop execution.
   - `w` must be greater than 3, which is not directly related to the loop execution.
   - `ln` is an input integer, which is not directly related to the loop execution.

Based on the above analysis, the only states that need to be adjusted are those related to `palka` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `palka`**
