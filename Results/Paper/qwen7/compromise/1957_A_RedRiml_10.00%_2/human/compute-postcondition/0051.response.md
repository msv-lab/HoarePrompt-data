Output State: `shapes` is 3, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` is a list of all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `shapes` will retain the value it had after the last iteration, which is 3. The list `palka` remains empty because the loop does not add any elements to it. The dictionary `d` is also empty since the loop does not modify it. The list `pl` contains all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered, as no elements are added or removed from `pl` during the loop's execution.
