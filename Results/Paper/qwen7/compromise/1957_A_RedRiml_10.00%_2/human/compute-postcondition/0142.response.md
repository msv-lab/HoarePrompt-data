Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `d` contains the count of each unique element in the list `palka` after all iterations, `pl` contains all elements from `palka` that were not already in `pl` during the loop's execution, `w` remains greater than 0, `ln` remains as the input integer, and `palka` is an empty list.**

This output state reflects that the variable `shapes` has been initialized to 0, while the dictionary `d`, list `pl`, variable `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged from their previous states, and `palka` is now an empty list.
