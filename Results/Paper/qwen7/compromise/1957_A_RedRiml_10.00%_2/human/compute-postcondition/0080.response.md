Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `palka` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is the last element of `palka`.
   - `pl` is a list containing the last element of `palka`.
   - If `i` is not in `pl`, then `d[i]` is either incremented by 1 (if it was not None) or set to 1 (if it was None).

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `palka`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is the last element of `palka` at the end of the previous iteration, the next element in `palka` (if it exists) will be the new value of `i`.
   - `pl` will be updated to contain this new value of `i`.
   - The condition `if i not in pl` will be checked with the new value of `i`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `palka` will lose its last element since `i` is now being used for the current iteration.
   - `i` will be the new last element of `palka`.
   - `pl` will be updated to include this new `i`.

5. **Post-Iteration State:**
   - `palka` will have at least 1 element (since it had at least 2 elements initially and lost one).
   - `i` will be the new last element of `palka`.
   - `pl` will contain the new last element of `palka`.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is the last element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the last element of `palka`.**
