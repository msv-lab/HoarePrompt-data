Postcondition: `palka` contains at least one element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`. After executing the if-else block, the condition `i not in pl` no longer holds true as `i` is now added to `pl`.
