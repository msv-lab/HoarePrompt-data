Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the list `d`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the list `pl`, which means `j` takes on each value in `pl` in sequence.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `shapes` is increased by 1.
   - `d[j]` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `d` is a list of integers.
   - `j` is an index within the range of the list `d`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by the loop, it will take the next value in `pl`.
   - `shapes` will be increased by 1 again.
   - `d[j]` must still be an integer greater than or equal to 3.
   - `d` remains the same list of integers.
   - `j` will be the next index in `pl`.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`shapes` is increased by 1, `d[j]` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `d` is a list of integers, and `j` is an index within the range of the list `d` but now `j` is the next index in `pl`**.
