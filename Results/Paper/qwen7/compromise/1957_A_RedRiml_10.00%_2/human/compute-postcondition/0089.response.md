Output State: **All elements in `palka` are appended to `pl`, `d` contains each unique element from `palka` as a key with its value being the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`, and `shapes` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `shapes = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `shapes`. It does not affect the lists `palka` and `pl`, nor does it modify the dictionary `d`. Therefore, the state of `palka`, `pl`, and `d` remains unchanged from their initial state, and only `shapes` is now set to 0.
