Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `pl`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - `pl` must have at least one element.
   - `j` must be the next valid element in `pl` if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `shapes` is 2.
   - `palka` is an empty list.
   - `d` is an empty dictionary.
   - `pl` must have at least one element.
   - `j` must be the next valid element in `pl` if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since `pl` must have at least one element, it implies that `pl` had at least one element at the start of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `pl` must still have at least one element.
   - `j` must be the next valid element in `pl` based on the condition `d[j] >= 3`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `shapes` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `palka` remains an empty list as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `d` remains an empty dictionary as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `pl` must still have at least one element.
   - `j` must be the next valid element in `pl` based on the condition `d[j] >= 3`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`shapes` is 2, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `pl` must have at least one element, and `j` must be the next valid element in `pl` if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**
