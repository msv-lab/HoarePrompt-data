Output State: **`palka` is not empty, `i` is the first element of `palka`, `d[i]` is set to 1, and `pl` contains the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `palka` is not empty, `i` is the first element of `palka`, and `d[i]` is set to 1, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `pl` now contains the value of `i`.
