Output State: **`t` must be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` is 1 or greater than or equal to 195, `s` is a string containing characters from 'ù' to 'ý', `j` is 195, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial values of `t`, `i`, `k`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` is 1 or greater than or equal to 195, `s` is a string containing characters from 'ù' to 'ý', and `j` is 195 at the start of each iteration is still valid.
