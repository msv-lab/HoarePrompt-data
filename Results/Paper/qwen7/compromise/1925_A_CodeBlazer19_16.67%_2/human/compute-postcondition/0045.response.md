Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 676.
- `i` is 3.
- `k` must be greater than 99.
- `s` is a string consisting of 95 '没' characters.
- `j` is 291.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer, and the condition `k` equals 1 holds true.

The `print(n * s)` statement will print the result of multiplying the input integer `n` by the string `s`, which consists of 95 '没' characters.

Therefore, the output will be a string consisting of `n * 95` occurrences of the character '没'.

Output: **a string consisting of [n * 95] '没' characters**
