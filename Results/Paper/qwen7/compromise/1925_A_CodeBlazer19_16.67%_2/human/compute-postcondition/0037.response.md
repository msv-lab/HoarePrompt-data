Output State: **`t` must be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` must be at least 98, `s` is the character 'ù', `j` is 195, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Given that `j` is 195, the character appended to `s` is 'ù'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
