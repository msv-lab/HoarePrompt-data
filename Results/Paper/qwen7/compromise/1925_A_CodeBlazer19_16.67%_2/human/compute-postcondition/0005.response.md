Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` + 97 is a valid upper bound, `s` is 'a', `j` is 97**.

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Given that `j` is initially 97, which corresponds to the character 'a', `s` is updated to 'a'. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
