Reasoning:

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_14()**: This function correctly generates a sequence `a` based on the given `n` and `k`. It handles two cases:
     - When `k == 1`, it generates a sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8]` if `n == 2`, otherwise, it generates a sequence of powers of 2 up to `n`.
     - When `k > 1`, it generates a sequence that includes `k+1`, `2*k+1`, and additional powers of 2 to ensure that all numbers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.
   - **func_15()**: This function correctly calls `func_14()` for each test case and prints the results. It ensures that the sequence `a` meets the required conditions for each test case.

2. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
     - For all `1 \le v \le n` where `v \ne k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

3. **Execution States**:
   - The provided functions `func_14()` and `func_15()` correctly implement the logic to generate and print the required sequences for each test case. The sequence generation logic in `func_14()` ensures that the conditions are met.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
