Output State: The output consists of lines printed to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write`, with each line containing a string returned by `func_14()` during each iteration of the loop. The number of iterations is determined by `func_10()`. Without knowing the exact implementations of `func_10()` and `func_14()`, we can only describe the general form of the output state. Each line will contain a string value produced by `func_14()` during each call within the loop.
