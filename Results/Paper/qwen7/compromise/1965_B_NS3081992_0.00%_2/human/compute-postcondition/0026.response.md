Output State: b is the binary representation of n without the '0b' prefix, k is an integer between 1 and n but not equal to 1, bk is the binary representation of k without the '0b' prefix, l is the length of b, ans is a list containing [2, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** (lk), 2 ** (lk + 1), ..., 2 ** (l - 1)].

Explanation: The loop iterates from `lk` to `l-1` and appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans` for each iteration. Therefore, the final list `ans` will contain the initial elements `[2, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` followed by powers of 2 starting from `2 ** lk` up to `2 ** (l - 1)`.
