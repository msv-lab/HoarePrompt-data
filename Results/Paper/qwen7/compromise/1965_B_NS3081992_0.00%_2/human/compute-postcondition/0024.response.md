Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` but not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is a list containing `[2, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`**

Explanation: The code appends `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains `[2, k + 1]`. After appending `2 * k + 1`, `ans` becomes `[2, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
