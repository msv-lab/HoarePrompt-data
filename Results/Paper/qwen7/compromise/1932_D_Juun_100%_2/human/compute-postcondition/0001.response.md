Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, and we read an input but did not process it yet.**

The code `trump = input()` assigns the value entered by the user to the variable `trump`. Since no specific value is provided, `trump` is now a string containing the user's input. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
