Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data through a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t, followed by two integers n and k, then n integers a_1 to a_n, and finally n integers x_1 to x_n. It returns a result based on the given conditions and calculations for each test case.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases, each containing an integer t, two integers n and k, a list of n integers a_i, and another list of n integers x_i. The function processes these inputs according to specified rules and returns a result for each test case.
