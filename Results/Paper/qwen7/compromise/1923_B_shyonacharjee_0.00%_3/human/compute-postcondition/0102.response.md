Output State: **`position` is assigned the value of `monsters[i][0]`; `health` is assigned the value of `monsters[i][1]`; `distance` is the absolute value of `position`.**

This means that the `distance` variable is now holding the absolute value of the `position` variable, which was originally assigned the value of `monsters[i][0]`. The `health` and `position` variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
