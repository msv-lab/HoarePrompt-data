Output State: **`bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `position` is `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is `distance`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`, and `success` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code `distance = abs(position)` updates the value of `distance` to be the absolute value of `position`. Since `position` was already defined as `monsters[i][0]`, `distance` now holds the absolute value of `monsters[i][0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
