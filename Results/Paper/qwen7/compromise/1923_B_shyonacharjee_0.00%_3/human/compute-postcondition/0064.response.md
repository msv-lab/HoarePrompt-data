Output State: **`distance` is `abs(position)`, `success` is False, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters plus `bullets_needed`, `i` is `i-1`, `bullets_needed` is the `health` of the current monster, `position` is the `position` of the current monster, `health` is the `health` of the current monster, `time_available` is now equal to `distance`, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions, the current `position` and `health` are assigned from the tuple `monsters[i]`, `bullets_needed` is updated to be equal to the `health` of the current monster.**

Explanation: The line `bullets_needed = health` updates the value of `bullets_needed` to be the `health` of the current monster. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
