Output State: **`i` is `t-1`, `distance` is `abs(position)'`, `time_available` is `abs(position)'`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`, `position` and `health` are assigned the values from `monsters[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` increments the value of `total_bullets_used` by the value of `bullets_needed`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, including `i`, `distance`, `time_available`, `bullets_needed`, and the assignment of `position` and `health` from `monsters[i]`. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement as mentioned in the precondition.
