Output State: **`success` is False, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `i` is `n-2`, `bullets_needed` is the `health` of the current monster, `position` is the position of the current monster, `health` is the health of the current monster, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is `distance`, `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions.**

Explanation: The line `success = False` sets the variable `success` to `False`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
