#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a parentheses sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance attribute of infoA and the balance attribute of infoB.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a parentheses sequence. The balance of `infoA` is equal to the balance of `infoB`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position attribute of infoB and the position attribute of infoA.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, infoA and infoB, which are objects with attributes `balance` (an integer) and `position` (an integer). It returns the difference between the `balance` attribute of `infoA` and the `balance` attribute of `infoB` if their balances are not equal. If their balances are equal, it returns the difference between the `position` attribute of `infoB` and the `position` attribute of `infoA`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects where each object contains the balance value, index `i`, and character `s[i]` for each iteration; `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is a string containing the characters from the `character` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object in the `balance_info` list, sorted by balance value in ascending order and by position in descending order for objects with the same balance value)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", verifies that it forms a valid balanced parentheses sequence, and prints a new string where the characters from `s` are rearranged according to their balance value and position. Specifically, the characters are sorted first by their balance value in ascending order and then by their original positions in descending order among those with the same balance value.
