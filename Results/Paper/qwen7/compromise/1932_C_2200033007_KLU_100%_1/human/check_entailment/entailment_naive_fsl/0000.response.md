Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not calculate the product of the array elements before taking the remainder when divided by `m`. Instead, it incorrectly appends either the leftmost or rightmost element of the array to the list `b` based on the command, which does not align with the requirement to output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array at each step.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

Expected Output:
```
0 2 4 1
```

However, the program's output is:
```
0 2 4 4
```

This discrepancy occurs because the program appends the elements to `b` without calculating the product of the remaining elements of the array. For instance, after the first command 'L', the program appends `a[0]` (which is 3) to `b` instead of calculating the product of the remaining elements `[1, 4, 2]` modulo `m`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
