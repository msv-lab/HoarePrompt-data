Reasoning:
1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( m \), the array \( a \), and the string of commands \( s \).
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of the array `a` based on the commands in `s`.
   - It uses two pointers `l` and `r` to traverse the array from both ends. For each command in `s`, it appends the corresponding element from `a` to `b` and updates the pointers accordingly.
   - After constructing `b`, it calculates the product of its elements in reverse order, taking the result modulo \( m \) at each step, and stores these intermediate results in the list `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed list `ans`.

3. **Reversal of `ans`**:
   - The function `reversed(ans)` is used to reverse the list `ans` before returning it. This ensures that the results are in the correct order as required by the problem statement.

Given the problem requirements and the steps performed in the function `func_1`, the program correctly processes each command, updates the array, and computes the required remainders in the specified order.

Correctness: **True**
