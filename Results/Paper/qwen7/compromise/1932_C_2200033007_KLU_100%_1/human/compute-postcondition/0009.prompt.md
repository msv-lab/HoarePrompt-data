Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p` is 1, `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `a[l]` (if corresponding `s[i]` is 'L') or `a[r]` (if corresponding `s[i]` is 'R'), with `l` starting at 0 and `r` starting at `n-1`, and moving towards each other based on the characters in `s`. The final positions of `l` and `r` will be `n` (after the loop) since `l` will be incremented until it reaches `n` and `r` will be decremented until it becomes -1; `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v in reversed(b):
    p = p * v % m
    ans.append(p)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
