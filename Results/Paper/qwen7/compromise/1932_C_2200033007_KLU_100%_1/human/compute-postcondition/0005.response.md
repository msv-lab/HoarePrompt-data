Output State: `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `a[l]` (if corresponding `s[i]` is 'L') or `a[r]` (if corresponding `s[i]` is 'R'), with `l` starting at 0 and `r` starting at `n-1`, and moving towards each other based on the characters in `s`. The final positions of `l` and `r` will be `n` (after the loop) since `l` will be incremented until it reaches `n` and `r` will be decremented until it becomes -1.
