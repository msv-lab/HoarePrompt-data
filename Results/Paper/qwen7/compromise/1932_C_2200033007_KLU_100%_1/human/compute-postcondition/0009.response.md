Output State: `p` is the product of all elements in the reversed list `b` modulo `m`, `b` remains as the list of integers initialized based on the characters in `s`, `l` is `n`, `r` is -1, and `ans` is a list containing all intermediate values of `p` computed in each iteration of the loop, starting from the initial value of `p` up to the final value after reversing and multiplying all elements of `b`.
