Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `match_a_b` is False**

Explanation: The line `match_a_b = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `match_a_b`. This does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `i` and `n`, and adds the new condition for `match_a_b`.
