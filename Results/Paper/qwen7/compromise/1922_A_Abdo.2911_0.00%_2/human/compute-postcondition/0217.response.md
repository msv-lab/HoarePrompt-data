Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `4 * n`, `match_c` remains `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited regardless of the values of `template[i]` or `c[i]`.**

Explanation: Given the loop iterates `n` times, and based on the provided output states after the first three iterations, we can infer the behavior of the loop. After each iteration, `i` increases by `n`, starting from `2 * n + (n - 1)` which simplifies to `3 * n - 1` for the first iteration. The output state after 3 iterations shows that `i` becomes `3 * n` and `match_c` remains `False`. Following this pattern, after all `n` iterations, `i` will be `4 * n`. Since the loop exits when it encounters a mismatch or when it has iterated through all elements, `match_c` remains `False` throughout the loop's execution.
