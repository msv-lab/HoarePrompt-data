Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive), as indicated by `range(n)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is 4 * `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Check if the loop can continue:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 4 * `n`, and `i` must be less than `n`, this condition cannot be satisfied because `4 * n` is always greater than `n` for any positive integer `n`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the condition `i < n` is not met, the loop will not execute any further iterations.

5. **Adjust the states:**
   - No changes are needed to `i` or `n` since the loop will not execute again.
   - The postconditions and other states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which won't occur) remains the same as the current state.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 4 * `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be less than `n`.**
