Output State: **`i` is `3 * n - 1`, `match_c` is `False`**

Explanation: The line `match_c = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `match_c`. The initial values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them. Therefore, `i` is still `3 * n - 1` and `match_c` is set to `False`.
