Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of string `a`, `match_a_b` is False**

The code `match_a_b = False` does not change the values of `i` or `n`. It only updates the value of `match_a_b` to `False`, which was already `False` in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.
