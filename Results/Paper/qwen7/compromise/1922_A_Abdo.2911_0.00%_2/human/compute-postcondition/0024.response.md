Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is the length of string `a`.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `match_a_b` is `True`.
   - `n` is the length of string `a`.
   - `a` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces.
   - `b` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces.
   - `c` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces.
   - `template` is a list containing elements based on the comparison of characters in strings `a` and `b`.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, the initial state of `i` should be set to 0.
   - The value of `n` is already given as the length of string `a`, so no adjustment is needed here.

6. **Final State Before the Loop Starts**:
   - `i` must be 0.
   - `n` must be the length of string `a`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `i` is 0 and `n` is the length of string `a`.

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of string `a`**
