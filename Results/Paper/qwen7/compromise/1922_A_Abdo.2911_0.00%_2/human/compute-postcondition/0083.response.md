Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `n` is greater than 0, and `template[i+1]` is not a lowercase character**

Explanation: The line `match_c = False` changes the value of `match_c` from `True` to `False`. The other variables (`match_a_b`, `n`, and `template[i+1]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
