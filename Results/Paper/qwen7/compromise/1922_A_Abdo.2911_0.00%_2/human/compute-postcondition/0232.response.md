Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `4 * n`.
   - `n` is not explicitly given its value in the state, but it is used in the initialization of `i`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to `4 * n`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n` for the loop to execute. This means `4 * n` should be less than `n`, which is not possible unless `n` is 0 or negative. However, typically `n` would be a positive integer, so we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 0 and `i` to be less than `n`.
   - We don't need to adjust `match_c`, `match_a_b`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `template` because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 4 * n, `n` must be greater than 0 and i must be less than n**
