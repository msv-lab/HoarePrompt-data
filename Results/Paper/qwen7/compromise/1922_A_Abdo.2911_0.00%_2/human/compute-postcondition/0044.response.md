Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is the length of string `a`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the condition `a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]` is not met, the variables remain unchanged.
