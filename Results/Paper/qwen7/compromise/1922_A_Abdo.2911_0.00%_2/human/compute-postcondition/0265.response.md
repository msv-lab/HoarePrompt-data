Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter. If `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, then `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If neither condition is met, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
