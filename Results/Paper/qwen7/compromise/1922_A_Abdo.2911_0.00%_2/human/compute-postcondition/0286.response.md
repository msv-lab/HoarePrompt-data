Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `match_a_b` is False**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `match_a_b`. This does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. Therefore, the initial conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `match_a_b` is set to `False`.
