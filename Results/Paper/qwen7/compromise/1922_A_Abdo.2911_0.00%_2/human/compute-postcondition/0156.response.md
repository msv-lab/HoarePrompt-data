Output State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `match_a_b` is `False`, `template[i]` is the character at index `i` in `template`**

Explanation: The line `match_a_b = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `match_a_b`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
