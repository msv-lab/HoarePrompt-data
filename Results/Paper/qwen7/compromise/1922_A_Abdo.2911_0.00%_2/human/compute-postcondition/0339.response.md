Output State: `match_a_b` is either `True` or `False`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `i` is `3`, and `n` is greater than `3`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `i` will always be `3` because the loop increments `i` within its body but stops after three iterations as per the given conditions. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` will depend on the inputs provided throughout the iterations. Since the loop exits after 3 iterations, it means that the conditions inside the loops were checked up to the third element of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` will reflect whether the respective conditions were met during these iterations.
