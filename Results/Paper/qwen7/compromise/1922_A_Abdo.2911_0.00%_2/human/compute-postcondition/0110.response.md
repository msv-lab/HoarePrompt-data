Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False`, `match_c` is `False`, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the stripped input string to the variable `c`. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain unchanged from their initial state. The input string is stripped of any leading and trailing whitespace before being assigned to `c`.
