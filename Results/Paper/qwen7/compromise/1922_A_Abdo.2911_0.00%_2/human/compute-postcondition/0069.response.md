Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character, and the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `template[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c`, nor does it modify the characters in `template[i]` or `c[i]`. It simply exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within.
