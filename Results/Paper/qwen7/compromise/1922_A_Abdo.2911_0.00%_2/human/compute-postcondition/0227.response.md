Output State: **`i` is `4 * n`, `match_c` remains `False`, `match_a_b` is `True` if the if condition is met, otherwise `match_a_b` is `False`, `t` is reduced by 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `n`. The other variables (`i`, `match_c`, `match_a_b`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
