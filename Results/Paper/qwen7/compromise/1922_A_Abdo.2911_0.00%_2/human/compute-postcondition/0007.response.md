State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `c` is the string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `template` is an empty list, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
2. The loop condition `range(n)` means that the loop will run as long as `i < n`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.
4. The initial state of `t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `template` does not affect the loop's execution directly, but they are part of the overall program state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (though its value is not critical for the loop to start), `n` (it must be greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute), and `i` (it is set to 0 at the start of the loop).
