Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the string input by user without leading or trailing spaces, `c` is the string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `template` is a list containing one element which is `a[0]`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `template.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `template`. Given that initially `i` is 0 and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`, `template` now contains `a[0]`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1.
