Postcondition: `i` is `2 * n + (n - 1)`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is a lowercase letter. If the character at index `i` in `template` is not a lowercase letter, then `match_c` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the character at index `i` in `template` is a lowercase letter, then no changes are made to `match_c` and the loop continues.
