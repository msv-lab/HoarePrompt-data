Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Template Construction**: For each test case, it constructs a template by comparing characters of strings `a` and `b`. If the characters at the same position are the same, it appends the character directly to the template. If they are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a`.
3. **Validation**:
   - It checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template.
4. **Output**: Based on the validation results, it prints "YES" if the conditions are met, otherwise "NO".

The logic implemented in the function is correct according to the problem statement and examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
