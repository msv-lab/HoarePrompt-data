You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: Output State: `match_a_b` is either `True` or `False`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `i` is `3`, and `n` is greater than `3`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` will depend on the conditions checked within the loops. The variable `i` will be set to `3` because it is incremented in the innermost loop, which runs up to `n-1`, and the loop iterates `t` times. Since `t` is the input integer and we know it is between 1 and 1000, `n` (which is the length of string `a`) will be greater than `3` as per the given conditions after three iterations. The final values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` will reflect whether the conditions specified in the loop were met for all inputs processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where both `a` and `b` can match the template but `c` can also match the template under certain conditions.

Consider the following test case:
```
n = 3
a = "abc"
b = "Abc"
c = "ABC"
```

In this case, the program will generate the template as follows:
- For `i = 0`: `a[0] = 'a'` and `b[0] = 'A'`, so the template will have `A`.
- For `i = 1`: `a[1] = 'b'` and `b[1] = 'b'`, so the template will have `b`.
- For `i = 2`: `a[2] = 'c'` and `b[2] = 'c'`, so the template will have `c`.

Thus, the generated template is `"Abc"`. Both `a` and `b` match this template, but `c` also matches the template because it is composed entirely of uppercase letters which do not conflict with the template's constraints.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that `c` does not match the template. This can be achieved by checking if `c` matches the template after generating it. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that `c` does not match the template, thus addressing the issue.
