Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where both `a` and `b` can match the template but `c` can also match the template under certain conditions.

Consider the following test case:
```
n = 3
a = "abc"
b = "Abc"
c = "ABC"
```

In this case, the program will generate the template as follows:
- For `i = 0`: `a[0] = 'a'` and `b[0] = 'A'`, so the template will have `A`.
- For `i = 1`: `a[1] = 'b'` and `b[1] = 'b'`, so the template will have `b`.
- For `i = 2`: `a[2] = 'c'` and `b[2] = 'c'`, so the template will have `c`.

Thus, the generated template is `"Abc"`. Both `a` and `b` match this template, but `c` also matches the template because it is composed entirely of uppercase letters which do not conflict with the template's constraints.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that `c` does not match the template. This can be achieved by checking if `c` matches the template after generating it. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that `c` does not match the template, thus addressing the issue.
