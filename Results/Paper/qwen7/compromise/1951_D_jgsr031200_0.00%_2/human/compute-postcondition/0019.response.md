Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`
     - Given `n = 0`, `costs` becomes `[0 - k + 1, 1]` which simplifies to `[1 - k, 1]`.
   - `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each value in `costs` (ignoring the last element since it's always 1).
     - Since `n = 0`, `h` is `0 / (1 - k) + 0 / 1` which simplifies to `0 / (1 - k) + 0 = 0`.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given the above breakdown, the print statement will simply output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
