### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).

2. **Base Case**: If `n` equals `k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is correct because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels if the price is 1 coin per jewel.

3. **Case When `n < k`**: If `n` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO" and returns. This is correct because Alice cannot buy even one jewel if she has fewer coins than the desired number of jewels.

4. **Case When `n >= k`**: 
   - The program initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall using `curr = n // i` and accumulates the total number of jewels bought (`h`).
   - If the total number of jewels bought (`h`) is less than `k`, the program prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels if the total number of jewels bought is less than `k`.
   - If `h` is at least `k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

However, there are some issues with the logic and output formatting:

- **Incorrect Output Formatting**: The program should print the number of stalls and the prices for each stall only when the answer is "YES". Currently, it prints "2" and "YES" unconditionally, which is incorrect.

- **Logic for Multiple Stalls**: The logic for setting up multiple stalls is incomplete. The current implementation only handles the case where `n` is exactly `k` plus a small remainder. It does not handle more complex scenarios where multiple stalls are needed.

### Corrected Program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))

    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
    elif n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
        h = 0
        for i in costs:
            curr = n // i
            h += curr
            n -= i * curr
        
        if h < k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(len(costs))
            print(*costs)
```

### Correctness:

Given the corrected program, the logic is now correct and follows the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the original program as annotated is **incorrect** due to the issues mentioned above.

**Correctness: **False**
