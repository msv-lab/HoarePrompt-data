Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 1, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, `k` is 2, `j` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `k = j` simply assigns the current value of `j` (which is 2) to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` now holds the value 2, while `j` also remains 2, and the rest of the conditions and values for the other variables stay the same.
