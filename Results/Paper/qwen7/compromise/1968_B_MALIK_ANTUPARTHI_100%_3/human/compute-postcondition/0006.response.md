Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the value `b` used in the `range(b)` function.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a`: An integer obtained from input
   - `i`: 0
   - `b`: An integer obtained from input
   - `c`: An integer obtained from input
   - `d`: An input string
   - `e`: A string obtained from input
   - `k`: 0

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `b`. Therefore, the initial value of `j` should be 0 (as given), and `b` must be a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` is initialized to 0, so no adjustment is needed for `j`.
   - `b` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute. Since `b` is obtained from input, we need to ensure that `b` is greater than 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `b` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer obtained from input, `i` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer obtained from input, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string obtained from input, `k` is 0**
