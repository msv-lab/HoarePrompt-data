Output State: **`k` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. The original expression for `k` (`e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`) is no longer relevant since it has been explicitly overwritten. The other variables (`e`, `d`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
