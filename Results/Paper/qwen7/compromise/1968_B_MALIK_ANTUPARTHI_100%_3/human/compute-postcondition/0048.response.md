Output State: **`d` is a list, `j` is an index within the range of `d`, `e` is a list, `k` is `j + 1 + e[k:].index(d[j])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block that was checking the condition involving `k` and `c`, or the condition involving `j` and `b - 1`. The values of `d`, `j`, `e`, and `k` remain unchanged after the `break` statement is executed.
