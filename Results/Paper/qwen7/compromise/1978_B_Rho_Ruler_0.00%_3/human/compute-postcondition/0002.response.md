Output State: **`ans` is `k * b + (n - k) * a`, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b), `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the usual price and the modified price of the first k buns respectively, and `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of buns.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `(n - k) * a` to its current value. Since `ans` was initially `k * b`, after the operation, `ans` becomes `k * b + (n - k) * a`. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
