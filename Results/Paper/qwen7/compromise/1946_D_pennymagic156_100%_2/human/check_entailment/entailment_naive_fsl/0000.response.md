Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where the array `a` contains only zeros, which should result in the maximum number of segments being equal to the length of the array. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
3 0
0 0 0
```

The expected output is `3`, as we can create three segments `[1, 1]`, `[2, 2]`, and `[3, 3]`, each containing a single zero, and their XOR value will be `0`, which satisfies the condition. However, the provided program returns `-1` because it does not handle the case where all elements in the array are zeros correctly.

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description, hence the correctness is **False**.
