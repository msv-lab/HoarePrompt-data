Postcondition: `i` is 28, `u` is 1, `v` is even, and `v` is not 0, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation over the i-th bit of each element in `a`, `cnt` is the total number of times `op` became `False` during the loop execution, `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `v` is odd, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
