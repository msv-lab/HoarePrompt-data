Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with `val`, `op` is False, `t` is a list containing one element which is the same as `ai`, `ai` is 0**.

Explanation: The code assigns `0` to `ai`. Since `ai` was previously a reference to an element in the list `a`, this assignment does not change the elements in `a` or `t`, but it updates `ai` to be `0`. The other variables (`a`, `op`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
