Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with one less element, `val` is the third element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` XOR the i-th bit of `val`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. No other variables are affected. The initial conditions of `a`, `val`, and `op` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables along with the updated value of `cnt`.
