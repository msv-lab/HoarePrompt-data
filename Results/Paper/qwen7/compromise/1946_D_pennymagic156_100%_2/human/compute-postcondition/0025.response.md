Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers; `ai` is `ai` XOR (val right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1); `t` is a list containing one additional element which is `ai`; `val` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Given the initial state, `ai` is defined as `ai` XOR (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1). Since `val` is the next element in the list `a`, after executing the line `t.append(ai)`, `t` will contain one more element, which is the current value of `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their definitions.
