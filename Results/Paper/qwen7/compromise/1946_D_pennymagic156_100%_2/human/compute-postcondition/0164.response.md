Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with the next `val`, and `val` is the next element from `a`; `ai` is updated to be the current `ai` XORed with the next `val` and then XORed with `op` right-shifted by `i` and ANDed with 1; `t` is a list containing one additional element which is the updated `ai`; if `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.
