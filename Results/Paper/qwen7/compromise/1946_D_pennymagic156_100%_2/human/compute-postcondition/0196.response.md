Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `a` is an empty list, `val` is undefined (since `a` is empty), `op` is the final result of XORing the i-th bit of each element in `a` with itself, and `cnt` is the total number of times `op` became `False` during the loop executions.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all iterations, `a` will be an empty list since all elements have been processed. The variable `val` will be undefined as there are no more elements in `a`. The variable `op` will hold the result of XORing the i-th bit of each element in `a` with itself. If `op` becomes `False` (0) during any iteration, `cnt` is incremented; thus, `cnt` will be the total count of such occurrences.
