Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op`. It performs a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the result of `val >> i & 1`. Since the initial values of `val`, `i`, and `op` are not provided, we express the new value of `op` as `op ^ (val >> i & 1)`. The list `a` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
