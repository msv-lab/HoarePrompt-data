Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element; `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then bitwise AND with 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `op` using the expression `op ^= val >> i & 1`. This means `op` is first right-shifted by `i` bits (which effectively divides `val` by \(2^i\) and truncates the result to an integer), then bitwise ANDed with 1 (which leaves only the least significant bit of the result), and finally XORed with the current value of `op`. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged.
