Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for val in a:`. The only object involved here is `val`, which is being iterated over each element in the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `val`**: Since `val` is being assigned the value from the list `a` in each iteration, we need to consider the initial state of `val` before the loop starts. However, the initial value of `val` itself is not specified; rather, we need to focus on the state of the list `a`.

3. **Analyze the given states**:
   - `i` is 28.
   - `u` is `x` >> 28 & 1.
   - `v` is the sum of [(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a].
   - `op` is 0.
   - `ai` is 0.

4. **Focus on the loop condition**: For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**: We need to ensure that the list `a` is not empty for the loop to execute. The other variables (`i`, `u`, `v`, `op`, `ai`) do not directly affect the loop's execution and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the list `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must be a non-empty list**
