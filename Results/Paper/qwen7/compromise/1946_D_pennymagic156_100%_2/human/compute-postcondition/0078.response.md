Output State: **`i` is 28, `u` is `x` >> 28 & 1, `v` is the sum of [(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a], `op` is 0, `ai` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `op` and `ai` to 0. It does not modify the existing values of `i`, `u`, and `v`. Therefore, the values of `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
