Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for val in a:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `val` is the first element of `a`.
   - `op` is the result of `op` XOR the i-th bit of `val`.
   - If the result of `op` is `False`, the variable `cnt` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop will take the next element from the list `a` in each iteration.
   - After processing the current `val`, the loop will move to the next element in `a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `val` was the first element of `a` in the previous iteration, the next element in `a` will be the new `val`.
   - The list `a` will now have one less element because the first element has been processed.

Given this information, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `a` will now be a list with one less element than before (since the first element has been processed).
- `val` will be the second element of the original list `a`.
- `op` will be the result of `op` XOR the i-th bit of the new `val`.
- `cnt` will remain unchanged unless the new `op` is `False`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `a` is a non-empty list with one less element than before, `val` is the second element of the original list `a`, `op` is the result of `op` XOR the i-th bit of the new `val`, and `cnt` remains unchanged unless the new `op` is `False`.**
