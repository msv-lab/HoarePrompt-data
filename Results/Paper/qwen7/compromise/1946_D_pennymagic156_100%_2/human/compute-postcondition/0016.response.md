Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with each element modified by `val`, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` modifies the `i-th` element of the list `a` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `ai` and `val`. The value of `op` is updated according to the expression `op ^= val >> i & 1`, which means `op` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation between its current value and the `i-th` bit of `val`. The initial state of `a` being a non-empty list of integers and `op` being the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1` remains valid after the code execution.
