Postcondition: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been updated by performing XOR operation with `val`, `op` is now `val >> i & 1` (where `i` is the current index during the iteration), and `t` is a list with one additional element which is the XOR of the next element of `a` with `val`, and `ai` is 0. If `op` is `False`, the values of `a`, `op`, `t`, and `ai` remain unchanged.**
