Output State: **`a` must not be an empty iterable, `op` is the result of `val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1, and the current value of `op` is false, `cnt` is increased by 1**.

The code increments the variable `cnt` by 1. Since `a`, `op`, and the initial value of `op` are unchanged, they remain as described in the initial state. The value of `cnt` is now one more than its previous value.
