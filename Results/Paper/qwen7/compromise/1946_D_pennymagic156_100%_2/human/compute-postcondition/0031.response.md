Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers (with one element processed), `ai` is `val` ^ 0, `t` is a list containing three elements where the first two are 0 and the third is `ai`, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> ai & 1`**

Explanation: The code `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Initially, `t` contains two elements both equal to 0. After appending `ai`, `t` now contains three elements: the first two are 0 and the third is `ai`. The other variables remain unchanged.
