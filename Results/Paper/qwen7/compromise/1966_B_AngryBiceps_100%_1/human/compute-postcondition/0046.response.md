Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing the integer `n`, `first_row` is equal to `n`, `last_row` is equal to `n`**.

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments `last_row` by the last element of the last sublist in `a`. Since `a` is a list containing a single sublist which is `[n]`, `a[-1][-1]` is `n`. Therefore, `last_row` is updated to be `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
