Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is a valid integer (we don't know its exact value, but it is valid)
   - `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user
   - `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in the list `a`
   - `last_row` is the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be 1.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - Since the loop body is omitted, no changes are made to `n`, `a`, `first_row`, or `last_row` within the loop.
   - These variables remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` should be 1.
   - `n` remains a valid integer.
   - `a` remains a list containing one element which is the input from the user.
   - `first_row` remains equal to the first element of the only element in the list `a`.
   - `last_row` remains the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a`**.
