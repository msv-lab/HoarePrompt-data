Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the last element of the original input and the first element of the new input, `last_row` is increased by the last element of the new input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the original input, the second element is the original input, and the third element is the new input from the user, `first_row` is the sum of the last element of the original input and the first element of the new input, `last_row` is increased by the last element of the new input, `last_row` is further increased by the last element of the last sublist of `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
