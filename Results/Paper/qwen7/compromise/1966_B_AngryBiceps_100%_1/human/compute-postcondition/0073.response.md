Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user
   - `first_row` is the sum of the last element of the original input and the first element of the new input
   - `last_row` is increased by the last element of the new input

3. **Determine if the loop can execute again**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` becomes 2
   - `n` remains greater than 0 (since it was greater than 0 at the start and no operation changes its value within the loop head)

6. **Other variables (`a`, `first_row`, `last_row`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head**.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
