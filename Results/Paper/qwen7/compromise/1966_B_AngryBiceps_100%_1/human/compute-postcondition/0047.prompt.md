Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, and the conditions regarding the sets of characters in `first_row` and `last_row` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `last_row` is now the last character of the only element in the list `a`, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing the first character of the only element from the user's input, `first_row` is the first character of the only element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `last_row` is now the concatenation of its original value and the last character of the newly added element in the list `a`; `i` is 1; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list containing one more element than before, which is the input from the user; `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the original element and the first character of the new element in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing the integer `n`, `first_row` is equal to `n`, `last_row` is equal to `n`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
