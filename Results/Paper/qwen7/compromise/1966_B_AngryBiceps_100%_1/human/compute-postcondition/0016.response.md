Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is `first_row + a[-1][0]`, the second element is the input from the user, and the third element is the input from the user, `last_row` is equal to the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a` plus `a[-1][-1]` plus `a[-1][-1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `last_row` by adding `a[-1][-1]` to it. Given the initial state, `last_row` was equal to the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a` plus `a[-1][-1]`. After executing the code, `last_row` becomes the previous value of `last_row` plus `a[-1][-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
