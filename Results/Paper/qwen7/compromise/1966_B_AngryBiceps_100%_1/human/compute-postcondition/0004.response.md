Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space; `a` is an empty list; `first_row` is an empty string; `last_row` is an empty string.**

The code simply assigns an empty string to the variable `last_row`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `first_row` remain unchanged.
