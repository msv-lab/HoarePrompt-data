Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the corresponding input from the user, `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of all elements in the list `a`, and `last_row` is the concatenation of the last characters of all elements in the list `a`. The first element of `a` and the last element of `a` either do not consist of a single unique character or they are the same. If the first element of `a` consists of the same character and the last element of `a` consists of the same character, and the first and last elements of `a` are different, then the condition holds. Otherwise, the condition does not hold.
