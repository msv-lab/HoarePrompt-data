Output State: **`last_row` is now the last character of the only element in the list `a`, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing one more element than before, which is the input from the user, `first_row` is the first character of the only element in the list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `a`. Since `a` was initially a list containing one element (the first character of the only element from the user's input), after appending the new input, `a` now contains two elements. The `last_row` remains the last character of the only element in the list before the append operation, and `first_row` remains the first character of the only element in the list before the append operation. The values of `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
