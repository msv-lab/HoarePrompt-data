Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list with one element which is the input integer `n`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the input value (which is an integer) to the list `a`. Since `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, it is appended to the list `a`. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 2.
