Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input received during the corresponding iteration of the loop. The variable `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`. The variable `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in `a`, and each character appears twice. The length of the set of the first character of the first element in `a` is 1, the length of the set of the last character of the last element in `a` is 1, and the first and last elements in `a` are not the same.**
