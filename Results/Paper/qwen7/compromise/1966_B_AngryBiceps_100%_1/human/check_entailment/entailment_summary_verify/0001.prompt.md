You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1]):
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of size n × m filled with 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. For each test case, it checks if the first and last rows of the grid are uniform (all 'W' or all 'B') and distinct from each other. If any test case fails this condition, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' for all passing test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations. An operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and changing the color of all squares within the subrectangle defined by those two squares.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the first row and the last row are different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color because no operation can change the color of the boundary rows.
   - Similarly, if any two adjacent rows or columns have different colors, it's also impossible to make the entire grid the same color because no operation can bridge the gap between these differently colored rows or columns.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It stores the first and last rows of the grid in `first_row` and `last_row`.
   - It checks if the first and last rows are different colors (`a[0] != a[-1]`) and if the sets of unique characters in the first and last rows are not singletons (`len(set(a[0])) != 1` or `len(set(a[-1])) != 1`). If either condition is true, it prints "NO".
   - If the conditions are not met, it prints "YES".

4. **Flaws in the Given Code**:
   - The code only checks the first and last rows, but it should check all rows and columns.
   - The logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color is incomplete. It doesn't account for the possibility of making all squares the same color if the grid has uniform rows or columns.

### Correctness:
The given code is incorrect because it fails to consider the possibility of making all squares the same color if the grid has uniform rows or columns. It only checks the first and last rows, which is insufficient.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if all rows or all columns are the same color. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        if all(row == a[0] for row in a):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Check if all columns are the same
        if all(a[row][col] == a[0][0] for row in range(n) for col in range(m)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        print('NO')

```

Correctness: **False**
