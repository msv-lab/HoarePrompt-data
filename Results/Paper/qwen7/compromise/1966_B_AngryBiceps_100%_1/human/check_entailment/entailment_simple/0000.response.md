Reasoning:
1. The program iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of the grid and the grid itself.
2. It then checks if the first and last row of the grid are different from each other and if they are not uniform (all 'W' or all 'B'). If this condition is met, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to make all squares the same color.
3. Similarly, it checks if the first and last column of the grid are different from each other and if they are not uniform. Again, if this condition is met, it prints 'NO'.
4. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make all squares the same color through the allowed operations.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The check for the first and last column should also consider whether the entire column is uniform.
- The current implementation only checks the first and last elements of the rows and columns, which is insufficient to determine if the entire column is uniform.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check if the entire first and last columns are uniform and different from each other.

Given the corrected logic, the program should be able to correctly determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks the first and last elements of the rows and columns, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire column is uniform. A more robust approach would be to check if the entire first and last columns are uniform and different from each other. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
        
        # Check if the first and last columns are uniform and different
        first_column = all(a[i][0] == a[0][0] for i in range(n))
        last_column = all(a[i][-1] == a[0][-1] for i in range(n))
        
        if first_column and last_column and a[0][0] != a[0][-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

With this correction, the program should correctly determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color.
