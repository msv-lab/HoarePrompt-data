The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid of size n Ã— m filled with 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. For each test case, it checks if the first and last rows of the grid are uniform (all 'W' or all 'B') and distinct from each other. If any test case fails this condition, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' for all passing test cases.
