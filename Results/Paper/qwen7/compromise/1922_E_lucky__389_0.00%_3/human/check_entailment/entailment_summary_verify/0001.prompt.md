You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a single test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range of 2 to 10^18. It calculates a sequence of integers and prints the count of unique integers in this sequence followed by the integers themselves. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The program attempts to generate such an array by breaking down `X-1` into powers of 2, which represent the lengths of segments of the array where the elements are strictly increasing.

2. **Key Logic in `func_1()`**:
   - The program subtracts 1 from `X` because the empty subsequence is not counted.
   - It then iteratively finds the largest power of 2 that fits into `X`, constructs the corresponding segment of the array, and updates `X`.
   - The segments are stored in `subseq_lens` and the maximum length among these segments is stored in `mx`.

3. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The array is constructed using the lengths in `subseq_lens`. For each segment, the program appends the appropriate number of elements to the array.
   - The first segment is filled with consecutive integers starting from 0 up to `mx-1`.
   - Subsequent segments are filled with the values from `subseq_lens`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `X` is 2, the array `[0]` is generated, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just `0`).
   - If `X` cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, the program will terminate early and return `-1`.

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the construction of the array based on the given constraints.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
