Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The solution uses a mathematical approach to construct such an array based on the binary representation of `X`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes an integer `x` and constructs an array with the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - It uses the binary representation of `x-1` to determine the structure of the array.
   - For each bit position `i` in the binary representation of `x-1`, if the bit is set, it adds `i` to the `subseq_lens` list multiple times, depending on the bit's significance.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum length of the increasing subsequences.
   - The `subseq_lens` list stores the lengths of the required segments.
   - The final array `ansv` is constructed by repeating the elements of `subseq_lens` in a specific pattern to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Output Verification**:
   - The function correctly prints the length of the array and the array itself.
   - Given the constraints and the logic, the function should produce the correct array for the given `X`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `X` is 2 by returning `[0]`.
   - For larger values of `X`, the function constructs the array based on the binary representation, ensuring the correct number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the provided code and the explanation, the function appears to correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
