Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Subsequence Length Calculation**: 
   - The program calculates the necessary lengths of the subsequence using powers of 2. Specifically, it finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x + 1` and subtracts the appropriate value from `x`.
   - This process ensures that the sum of the lengths of the subsequences equals `x`.

3. **Array Construction**:
   - The program constructs the array `ansv` by appending the calculated subsequence lengths multiple times.
   - For each subsequence length `i` in `subseq_lens`, it appends `i` twice to `ansv`.
   - This construction ensures that the number of increasing subsequences of the constructed array matches the input `x`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the constructed array followed by the array itself.
   - This matches the required output format.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct for generating arrays with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
