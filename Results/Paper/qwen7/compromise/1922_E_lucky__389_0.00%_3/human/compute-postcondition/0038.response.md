Output State: **`mx` is the maximum of 6 and `i`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is at least 29 - (2).**

Explanation: The line `mx = max(mx, i)` updates `mx` to be the maximum value between its current value (which is 6) and the value of `i`. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so `mx` will be updated to the maximum of 6 and `i`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the condition for `x` also remains unchanged.
