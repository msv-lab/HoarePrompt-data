Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `len(ansv)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `ansv`.

2. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `mx` is 6.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `x` is 13.
   - `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6, 4, and 4.
   - `i` is 1.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(ansv)`.

4. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

5. **Next Iteration Check**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and checked against `len(ansv)`.
   - If `i` is 1, then `i + 1` will be 2.
   - The condition for the next iteration is `i < len(ansv)`. Since `i` will become 2, we need to check if `2 < len(ansv)`.

6. **Determine `len(ansv)`**: The value of `len(ansv)` is not explicitly given, but it must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

7. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `len(ansv)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(ansv)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 13, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6, 4, and 4, `i` is 2, `len(ansv)` must be at least 2**
