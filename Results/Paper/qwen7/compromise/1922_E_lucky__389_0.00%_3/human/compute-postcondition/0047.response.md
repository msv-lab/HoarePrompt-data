Output State: **`mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is at least 15, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value 6, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`mx`, `t`, `x`, `subseq_lens`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
