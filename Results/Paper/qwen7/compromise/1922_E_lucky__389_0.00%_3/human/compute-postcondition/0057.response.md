Output State: `mx` is 6, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is 13, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the values 6 and 4, and `i` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop executes three times, we know that `x` has been reduced to 13, and `subseq_lens` contains the values 6 and 4. The loop will continue to run as long as `x` is not zero. Since `x` is now 13, which is less than \(2^4 - 1 = 15\), the inner while loop will not increment `i` further and will eventually break when `i` is 0. At this point, the loop will terminate, and the final state will be as described.
