The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) and another positive integer \( n \). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is even. If \( n \) is odd, it prints 'NO'. If \( n \) is even, it constructs a string \( s \) consisting of '110' repeated \( n/2 \) times. If the length of \( s \) is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by \( s \); otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
