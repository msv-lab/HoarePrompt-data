Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and calculating the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. However, there are some issues with the logic used to determine the maximum number of draws.

1. **Total Points Calculation**: The program correctly checks if the total points are even, which is necessary because each match can contribute at most 2 points (either 2-0 or 1-1).

2. **Total Matches Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of matches from the total points. This part is correct as well, since the total number of matches must be half of the total points.

3. **Validation of Total Matches**: The program correctly checks if the total number of matches is reasonable (i.e., not more than 3) and if the highest score is within the range of possible matches.

4. **Calculation of Draws**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws (`egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and `egalites // 2`) is incorrect. This formula does not account for the fact that each match can only contribute to the scores in specific ways (either 2 points to one player, or 1 point to each player in a draw).

To fix the calculation of draws, we need to consider the following:
- Each match can result in either 2 points to one player (win/loss) or 2 points split between two players (draw).
- The difference in scores between players can help us determine how many matches resulted in draws.

A correct approach would be:
- Calculate the number of win/loss matches needed to achieve the differences in scores.
- Subtract these from the total matches to find the number of draws.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        total_matches = total_points // 2
        
        if total_matches > 3 or p3 > total_matches:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the number of win/loss matches
        win_loss_matches = (p3 - p1) + (p3 - p2)
        
        if win_loss_matches > total_matches:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the number of draws
        draws = total_matches - win_loss_matches
        
        resultats.append(draws)
    
    return resultats
```

With this corrected logic, the program should now correctly determine the maximum number of draws for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
