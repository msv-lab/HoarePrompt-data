### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players.
   - Each game can either be a win/loss (2 points for one, 0 for the other) or a draw (1 point for each).
   - The scores are given in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code is designed to handle multiple test cases, but the input `t` is hardcoded to 7, and the test cases are also hardcoded in `cas_de_test`.
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the maximum number of draws.

3. **Key Steps in `func_1`:**
   - Calculate the total points scored by all players combined (`total_points`).
   - Check if the total points are even; if not, it's impossible to have such scores, so append `-1`.
   - Calculate the total number of matches (`total_matchs`), which is half of the total points.
   - Ensure the total number of matches does not exceed 3 (since only 3 pairs of players exist).
   - Calculate the number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{egalites} = \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p2}) - 2 \times (\text{p3} - \text{p1})
     \]
   - If the calculated number of draws is negative, it means the scores are inconsistent, so append `-1`.
   - Otherwise, append the number of draws divided by 2 (since each draw is counted twice).

4. **Checking the Example Cases:**
   - The provided examples match the logic in the code.
   - For instance, in the case `(0, 0, 0)`, no games were played, so no draws, resulting in `0`.
   - In the case `(0, 1, 1)`, one draw between the second and third player, resulting in `1`.
   - However, the original assessment does not consider the possibility of having more than 3 matches, which is a critical constraint.

5. **Critical Constraint:**
   - The code checks if `total_matchs > 3` and `p3 > total_matchs`, but it does not check if the number of matches exceeds the total possible matches among the three players. Since there are only three players, the maximum number of matches is 3 (each player plays against the other two).

6. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the case `(1, 1, 2)`, the total points are 4, and the total number of matches is 2. The calculation for draws is:
     \[
     \text{egalites} = 4 - 2 \times (2 - 1) - 2 \times (2 - 1) = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0
     \]
     This is correct, and the number of draws is 0.
   - For the case `(3, 3, 3)`, the total points are 9, and the total number of matches is 4.5, which is not an integer, so it should be `-1`. However, the code incorrectly calculates it as 0 because it does not enforce the constraint that the number of matches must be an integer.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The code fails to correctly handle the constraint that the total number of matches must be an integer and cannot exceed 3.
   - The hardcoded values for `t` and `cas_de_test` do not affect the logical flaw in the code.
