Output State: **The program returns a list of integers called 'resultats', where each element is either -1 or the result of 'egalites // 2' after passing all conditions in the loop.**

Explanation: The given code snippet does not provide the exact logic inside the loop or the value of `egalites`. However, based on the initial state, `resultats` is a list of integers where each element is either -1 or the result of `egalites // 2` after passing all conditions in the loop. Since no specific operations or values for `egalites` are provided within the loop, we can only describe the structure and possible values of the `resultats` list as mentioned.
