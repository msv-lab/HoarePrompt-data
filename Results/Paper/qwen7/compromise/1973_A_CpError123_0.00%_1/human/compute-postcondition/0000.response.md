Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `resultats` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `resultats`. This does not change the values of `t` or `cas_de_test`, but it does add a new piece of information about the `resultats` list being initialized as an empty list.
