### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
The code provided does not seem to address the problem statement correctly. Here is the breakdown:

1. **Function Definition**:
   ```python
   def func_1():
       n, k = map(int, input().split())
       ans = n
       root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
       for i in range(2, root + 1):
           cnt = i * i
           ans += (n + i) // cnt
       print(ans)
   ```

2. **Key Issues**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes `n` and `k` as inputs but only uses `n`. The variable `k` is never used.
   - The logic inside the function does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Instead, it calculates \(ans = n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{root}} \left(\frac{n + i}{i^2}\right)\), which is unrelated to the problem requirements.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state before and after the function call, but it does not reflect the intended logic for solving the problem.
   - The state after the function call shows that `ans` is calculated using a square root-based approach, which is not relevant to the problem.

Given these observations, the provided code does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate because the code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem.
