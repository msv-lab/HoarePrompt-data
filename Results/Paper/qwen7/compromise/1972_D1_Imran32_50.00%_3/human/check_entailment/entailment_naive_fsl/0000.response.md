Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the program attempts to solve a different problem related to counting pairs based on a square root-based approach, which is not relevant to the given problem.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple test case:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

Expected output:
- Pairs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 1)\) satisfy the condition.
- Output should be 4.

However, the program outputs 3, which is incorrect. This discrepancy indicates that the program does not handle the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
