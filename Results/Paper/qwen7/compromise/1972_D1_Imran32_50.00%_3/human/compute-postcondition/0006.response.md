Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `ans` is calculated as \( n + \sum_{i=2}^{root} \left(\frac{n + i}{i \cdot i}\right) \), where \( root = \text{int}(\sqrt{n}) + 1 \).

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` after the summation has been computed.

To break it down further:
- `root` is defined as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, which means it is the integer part of the square root of `n` plus one.
- The summation part of `ans` involves calculating \(\frac{n + i}{i \cdot i}\) for each `i` in the range from 2 to `root`.

Given these details, the exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `n` and `i` within the specified range. However, since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe the calculation process.

Output: **n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))**
