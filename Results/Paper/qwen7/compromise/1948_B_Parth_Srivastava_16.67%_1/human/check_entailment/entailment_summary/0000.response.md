Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `m` from the input.
2. It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results for each test case.
3. The program iterates over each test case, but it calls `func_1()` without passing any arguments, which is incorrect because `func_1()` expects the size of the array `k` and the array itself as inputs.
4. Inside `func_1()`, the program processes the array by splitting numbers greater than 10 into their digits and appending them to a new list `c`.
5. After processing all elements, it sorts the list `c` and checks if it matches the original list `c`. If it does, it means the array can be sorted using the allowed operations, and it appends 1 to `b`; otherwise, it appends 0.
6. Finally, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

However, the main issue is that the program does not correctly handle the input for each test case. It should read the size of the array `k` and the array itself within the loop that iterates over the test cases.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, you need to modify the loop that iterates over the test cases to correctly pass the size of the array and the array itself to `func_1()`. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
m = int(input())
b = []

for i in range(m):
    k = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    b.append(func_1(k, a))

for result in b:
    if result == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1(k, a):
    c = []
    n = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    return c == d
```

This corrected version ensures that `func_1()` receives the correct parameters and processes each test case properly.
