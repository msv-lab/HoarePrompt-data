Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99). It validates that the first integer n is within the range [2, 50] and each of the following n integers a_i is within the range [0, 99], and 1 <= t (the number of test cases) <= 10^3. The function does not return any value explicitly but processes and validates the input according to the specified constraints.**
