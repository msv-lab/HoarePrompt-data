Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99). For each integer greater than 10 in the input list, it extracts the last digit and the remaining part, then appends these parts to a new list c based on certain conditions. After processing all test cases, it checks if the list c is sorted. If c is sorted, it appends 1 to a list b; otherwise, it appends 0 to b. The function does not return any value but modifies the list b according to the sorting condition of the processed list c.**
