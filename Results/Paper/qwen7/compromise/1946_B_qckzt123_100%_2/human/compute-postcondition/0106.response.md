Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `x`, which is iterating over the list `a`. Other relevant variables are `tmp` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - **`x`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the first element of the list `a`. For the next iteration, `x` will be the second element of the list `a`.
   - **`tmp`**: The value of `tmp` depends on the first element of the list `a`. If the first element is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0; otherwise, it remains the same as its initial value.
   - **`t`**: The value of `t` is updated to be the maximum value between `tmp` and `t` during each iteration.

Given the information at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `x` is the first element of the list `a`.
- `tmp` is 0 if the first element of `a` is less than 0, otherwise `tmp` remains the same as its initial value.
- `t` is the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`.

For the next iteration:
- `x` will be the second element of the list `a`.
- `tmp` will still be the same as its value from the previous iteration (since `x` is now the second element and hasn't been checked yet).
- `t` will be updated to be the maximum value between `tmp` and `t` based on the new value of `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
- `x` is the second element of the list `a`.
- `tmp` is the same as its value from the previous iteration.
- `t` is the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the second element of the list `a`, `tmp` is the same as its value from the previous iteration, `t` is the maximum value between `tmp` and `t`**
