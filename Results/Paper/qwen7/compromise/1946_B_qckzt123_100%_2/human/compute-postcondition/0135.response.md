Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a constant, `t` is equal to `t % MOD`, `ans` is equal to `ans % MOD`, `t` is now `t % MOD`**.

Explanation: The line `ans %= MOD` updates `ans` to be the remainder when `ans` is divided by `MOD`. Since `t` is already set to `t % MOD`, its value remains unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `t`) remain in their initial or updated states as described.
