Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the last element of the list `a`, `tmp` is the maximum cumulative sum of `x` values without going below 0 during any iteration, `t` is the maximum value between `tmp` and `t` after processing all elements in `a`, and `ans` is (((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` using the formula `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. Here, `s` and `t` are variables that were previously updated within the loop. The values of `a`, `x`, `tmp`, and `t` remain unchanged from their previous states. The new value of `ans` is calculated based on the given formula, ensuring it is within the range defined by `MOD`.
