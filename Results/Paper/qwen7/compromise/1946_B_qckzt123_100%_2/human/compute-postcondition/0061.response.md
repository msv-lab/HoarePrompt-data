Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is 0, `ans` is 48 modulo MOD, `k` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `tmp` is `tmp + x`, `x` is the second element of `a`**.

Explanation: The code `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`. Since `x` is the second element of the list `a`, `tmp` is updated to be its current value plus the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
