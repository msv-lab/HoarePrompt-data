Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the first element of the list `a`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `tmp += x` adds the value of `x` (which is the first element of the list `a`) to `tmp`. Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers and `x` is the first element of the list `a`, after executing the code, `tmp` will hold the value of the first element of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
