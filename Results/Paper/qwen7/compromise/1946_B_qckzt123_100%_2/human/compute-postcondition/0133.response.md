Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a constant, `t` is equal to `t * 2 % MOD`, `ans` is equal to `ans % MOD`, `t` is now `t % MOD`**

Explanation: The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t % MOD`. This means that `t` is now equal to its remainder when divided by `MOD`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
