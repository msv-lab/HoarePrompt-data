Output State: **`t` is `max(0, t)`, `tmp` is 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining, `s` is the sum of all elements in the remaining list `a`**.

Explanation: The line `tmp = 0` sets the variable `tmp` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
