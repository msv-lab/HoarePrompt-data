Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 4.
   - `k` is an integer input from stdin.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially 4, for the loop to execute, `i` must eventually become less than `k - 1`.
   - Therefore, `k` must be greater than 5 (since `i` starts at 4 and the loop continues until `i < k - 1`).

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `k` is greater than 5 and `i` is 4.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 4, `k` must be greater than 5**
