Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 8 modulo MOD, `ans` is 0 modulo MOD, `t` is now 8 modulo MOD**

Explanation: The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t` modulo `MOD`. Since the initial value of `t` is 8 modulo `MOD`, `t` remains 8 modulo `MOD` after the operation. The other variables (`i` and `ans`) are not affected by this operation.
