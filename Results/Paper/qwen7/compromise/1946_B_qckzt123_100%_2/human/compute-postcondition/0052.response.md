Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is 0, `ans` is 48 modulo MOD, `k` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `tmp` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `t` and `tmp` to 0. The values of the other variables (`i`, `ans`, `k`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
