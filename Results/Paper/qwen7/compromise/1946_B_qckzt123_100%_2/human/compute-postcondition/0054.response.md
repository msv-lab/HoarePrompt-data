Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is 0, `ans` is 48 modulo MOD, `k` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is the sum of the list `a`, `tmp` is `x`, `x` is the first element of `a`.**

Explanation: The line `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by the value of `x`, which is the first element of the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
