Output State: `i` is `k`, `k` must be greater than or equal to the maximum value between 7 and the number of iterations, `t` is `t % MOD`, `ans` is the sum of `ans` initialized as `(48 + t) % MOD` plus the cumulative values of `t` multiplied by the iteration index, all taken modulo `MOD`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` must be at least as large as the number of iterations performed, `t` will be the last computed value of `t` which is `2^(k-1) % MOD`, and `ans` will be the initial value `(48 + t) % MOD` plus the sum of `t` multiplied by `2^j` for each iteration `j` from 0 to `k-2`, all taken modulo `MOD`.
