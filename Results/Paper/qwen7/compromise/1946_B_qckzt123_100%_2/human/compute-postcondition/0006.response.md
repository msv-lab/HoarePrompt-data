Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `t` and `tmp` with the values 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. `T` is also not affected by this code.
