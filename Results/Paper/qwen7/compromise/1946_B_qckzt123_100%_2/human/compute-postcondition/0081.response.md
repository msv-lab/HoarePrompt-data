Output State: **`i` is 5, `k` must be greater than 5, `t` is twice its original value.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is multiplied by 2, but since the initial value of `t` is not specified, we only know that `t` is now twice its original value. The variables `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
