Output State: **`t` is `max(0, t)`, `tmp` is `tmp + x`, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element remaining, `s` is the sum of all elements in the remaining list `a`**

Explanation: The code `tmp += x` increments the value of `tmp` by `x`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
