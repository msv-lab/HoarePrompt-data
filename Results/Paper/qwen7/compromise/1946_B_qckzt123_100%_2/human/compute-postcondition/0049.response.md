Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is 32 modulo MOD, `ans` is 48 modulo MOD, `n` is an integer input from stdin, `k` is an integer input from stdin**

The code reads two integers from standard input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. However, the initial values of `i`, `t`, and `ans` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains 4, `t` remains 32 modulo MOD, and `ans` remains 48 modulo MOD. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers read from the input, but their specific values are not provided in the initial state.
