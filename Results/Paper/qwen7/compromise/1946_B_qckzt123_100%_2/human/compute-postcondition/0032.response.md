Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2 modulo MOD, `i` must be less than `k - 1`**

The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t` modulo `MOD`. Given that `t` was initially 2, after executing this line, `t` becomes `2 % MOD`. The values of `i` and the condition `i must be less than k - 1` remain unchanged.
