Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic in both `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem statement and the expected behavior of the pinball movement.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` is designed to return a specific calculation involving the last element of a list `arr` and an integer `times`.
- The formula used in `func_1` seems to be a bit complex but is correctly implemented. It ensures that if `times` is non-positive, it returns zero; otherwise, it performs a subtraction based on the indices and values in `arr`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` processes the string `s1` to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
- The function uses two lists: `pre` and `suffZero` to keep track of positions of '>' and '<' characters respectively.
- It uses `preOne` and `suffZero` to perform cumulative operations which help in calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
- The core logic involves comparing the number of '>' and '<' characters to the left and right of the current position and using these counts to compute the time taken.

### Verification:
- The overall logic in `func_2` appears to correctly simulate the pinball movement and calculate the time taken for each cell.
- The use of cumulative sums (`preOne`) and the dynamic adjustment of `totalOne` and `suffZero` seem appropriate for tracking the positions of characters.
- The final computation of `ans[i]` seems to correctly reflect the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.

Given the detailed analysis, the implementation of both functions seems to correctly simulate the pinball movement and calculate the required times.

Correctness: **True**
