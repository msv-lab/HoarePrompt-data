Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 representing the length of the array, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `results` is a list to store the maximum beauty for each test case, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the `data` list (which is expected to be a string) to the variable `t` after converting it to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
