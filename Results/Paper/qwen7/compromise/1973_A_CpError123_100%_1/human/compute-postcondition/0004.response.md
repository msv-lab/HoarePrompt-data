Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the constraints where t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers between 0 and 30, with the condition that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.**

This means the function does not take any direct input parameters but operates within specific constraints for variables `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. It evaluates these variables according to their defined ranges and conditions.
