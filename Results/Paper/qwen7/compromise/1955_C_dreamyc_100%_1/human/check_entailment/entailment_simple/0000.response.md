Reasoning:
1. The problem involves simulating the attacks of the Kraken on a sequence of ships with varying durability. The Kraken attacks in a specific pattern: first the first ship, then the last, and continues alternating until all ships are sunk or there are no more attacks left.
2. The given solution attempts to solve this by calculating the cumulative sums from both ends of the list and determining how many ships can be sunk based on these cumulative sums.
3. However, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. Specifically, the approach of using cumulative sums to determine the number of ships that can be sunk is incorrect because it does not accurately simulate the alternating attack pattern of the Kraken.
4. The current implementation incorrectly counts the number of ships that can be sunk by comparing cumulative sums to `a` and `b`. This does not account for the alternating nature of the attacks and the fact that ships sink when their durability reaches zero.
5. A correct approach would involve simulating the attacks directly, keeping track of the durability of each ship and updating the count of sunk ships accordingly.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
