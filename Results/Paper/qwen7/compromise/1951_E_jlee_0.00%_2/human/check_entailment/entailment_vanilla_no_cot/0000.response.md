Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The program correctly handles single-character strings by printing "NO". However, the logic should be simplified and more straightforward.

2. **General Partition Logic**: The logic for partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings is flawed. The program tries to find a single non-palindromic substring or splits the string at certain points, which doesn't cover all possible cases.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle edge cases properly. For instance, it incorrectly prints "YES" for some cases where the string can be split into non-palindromic substrings, and it doesn't handle all possible valid partitions.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input().strip()
        n = len(string)
        
        # Check if the string itself is a palindrome
        if string == string[::-1]:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # If the string is not a palindrome, it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings
        print("YES")
        print(1)
        print(string)
```

This simplified version checks if the string is a palindrome and directly outputs the result without unnecessary complexity. If the string is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" with the entire string as a single partition. This approach covers all the required cases based on the problem statement.
