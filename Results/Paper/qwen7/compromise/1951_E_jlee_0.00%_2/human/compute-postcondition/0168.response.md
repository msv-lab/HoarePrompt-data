Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `True`
- `i` is `1`
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string
- `n` is `1`
- `x` is the first character of the input string
- `count` is updated to `j`, where `j` is `1`
- `count2` is either `0` or `1`
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

Here, `j` is `1`. Therefore, the slice operations will be:

- `string[:1]` will return the first character of the string.
- `string[1:]` will return the substring starting from the second character to the end of the string.

So, the print statement will output the first character of the string followed by the rest of the string.

Output: **first character of string, rest of the string**
