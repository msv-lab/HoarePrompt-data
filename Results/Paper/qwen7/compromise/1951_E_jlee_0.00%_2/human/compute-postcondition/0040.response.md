Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the input string, and the current value of `x` is not equal to the last element of `s`. If the count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n`, then `s` remains unchanged and the loop continues. Otherwise, if the count of `x` in `s` is 0 and either the current value of `n` is odd and the middle element of `s` is not equal to `x`, or the current value of `n` is not odd or the middle element of `s` is equal to `x`, then the loop continues.
