Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `done` is `True`.
- `count` is either `j` or `j + 1`.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the loop or if statement breaks.

The `print` statement is `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the conditions:

1. Since `done` is `True`, it means the loop or if statement did not break prematurely due to the inequality check.
2. This implies that for all `k` from `0` to `j - 1`, `s[k]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - k]`.
3. Therefore, the substring `string[:j]` is a palindrome up to the `j`-th character, and `string[j:]` is the remaining part of the string after the `j`-th character.

Given this, the print statement will output two parts of the string: the substring up to index `j` and the substring starting from index `j`.

Output: **string[:j], string[j:]**
