Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- `j` and `n` are integers.
- `done` is `True`.
- `count` is greater than 1.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- Either `count2` is less than or equal to 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`.
- The value of `count2` is equal to `count`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables since the print statement does not reference any of them.

Output: **YES**
