Output State: **`done` is True, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `x` is the first character of the input string, `count` is 1, `count2` is 0, `j` is 1, and the first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables in their initial or unchanged states.
