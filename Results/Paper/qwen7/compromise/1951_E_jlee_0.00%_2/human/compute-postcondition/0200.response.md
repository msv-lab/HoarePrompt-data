The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not have any direct impact on the variables outside of the loop. All variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of the new input string, `count` is 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and the first element of `s` is now the first character of `string`.**
