Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` is the same, `done` is True. `count` is either the same as the original `count` (if we break out of the loop or if statement when `count > 1`) or `j` (if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or `count` reaches 1). `count2` is either the same as the original `count2` (if we break out of the loop or if statement when `count > 1`) or 0 (if we continue the loop).
