Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` is `True`
- `i` is `1`
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string
- `n` is `1`
- `x` is the first character of the input string
- `count` is `1`
- `count2` is either `0` or `1`
- `j` is `1`
- The first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`

We need to determine what will be printed when the following code snippet executes:

```python
print('YES')
```

Given the information, the only thing being printed is the string `'YES'`. The values of the other variables (`done`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `x`, `count`, `count2`, `j`) are not relevant to the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **YES**
