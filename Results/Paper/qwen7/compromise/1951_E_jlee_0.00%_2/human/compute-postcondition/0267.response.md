Postcondition: **`count2` is either 0 or equal to `count`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the new input string, `n` must be at least 1, `done` is True, `x` is the first character of the new input string, `j` is 1, the first element of `s` is now the first character of `string`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, `s[j]` is equal to `x` if `count2` is equal to `count`, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, none of the changes specified in the if part occur.**
