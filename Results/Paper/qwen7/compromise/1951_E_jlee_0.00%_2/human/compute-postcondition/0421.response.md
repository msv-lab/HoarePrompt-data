Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `j` and `n` are integers, `done` is True, and `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, either `count2` is less than or equal to 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. The value of `count2` is equal to `count`, and `count` is less than or equal to 1**
