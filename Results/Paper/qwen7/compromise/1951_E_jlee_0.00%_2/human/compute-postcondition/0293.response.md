Output State: **`done` is True, `count` is `j`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block defined in the snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `done` and `count`. It only indicates that if it were within a loop or conditional structure, the execution would exit that structure. Therefore, the values of `done` and `count` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement is noted as having been executed.
