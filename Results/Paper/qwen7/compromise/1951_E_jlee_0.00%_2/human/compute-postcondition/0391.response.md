Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- `j` and `n` are integers.
- The character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` of `s`.

The print statement is simply `print(1)`. This statement will print the integer `1` regardless of the values of `s`, `j`, and `n`, as long as the condition about the characters at the specified indices holds true.

Output: **1**
