You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the sequence of integers can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence by ensuring no two consecutive elements violate a specific order condition. If any changes are needed, it makes the necessary adjustments. After processing all test cases, it outputs "YES" if the sequence can be transformed as required, otherwise "NO".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Specifically, the program checks if the current element is less than the previous element and attempts to split the larger element to see if sorting is possible. However, it does not properly handle the case where the array can still be sorted after splitting elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program should correctly identify that by splitting `45` into `[4, 5]`, the array can be sorted to `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario. It only checks if the split array is sorted but does not update the original array correctly.

A more appropriate approach would involve attempting to split elements and checking if the resulting array is sorted. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        
        def can_sort(arr):
            for i in range(1, len(arr)):
                if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                    return False
            return True
        
        def split_and_check(arr):
            for i in range(len(arr)):
                num = arr[i]
                if num >= 10:
                    split_arr = [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
                    if can_sort(split_arr + arr[:i] + arr[i+1:]):
                        arr[i] = split_arr[0]
                        return True
            return False
        
        while not can_sort(arr):
            if not split_and_check(arr):
                ans = False
                break
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the array is checked and split correctly to determine if it can be sorted.
