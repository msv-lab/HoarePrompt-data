Output State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, and `ans` is `False`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `arr`, `i`, `nums`, and `ans`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. The values of `arr`, `i`, `nums`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
