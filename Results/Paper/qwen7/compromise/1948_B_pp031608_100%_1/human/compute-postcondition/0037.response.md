Output State: `ans` is False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, and the final value of `arr[0]` is the first digit of the original `arr[0]` if no further conditions in the loop were met to change it.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `ans` will remain `False` because the loop breaks when the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true and the list `nums` is not sorted. The loop iterates backward from `m-1` to `1`, and if it finds any pair where the current element is less than the previous one and the constructed list `nums` is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds such a pair, `i` will be set to the index just before the found pair, which means `i` will be `0` after the loop ends. The value of `arr[0]` will be the first digit of the original `arr[0]` unless another condition in the loop changes it, but since we know `ans` is `False`, no further changes were made to `arr`.
