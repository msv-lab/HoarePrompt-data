Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `m - 1` to `0` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` will take values from `m-1` down to `0`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `0`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since the loop starts from `m-1` and goes down to `0`, `i` must initially be set to `m-1` for the loop to start executing.

5. **Determine the state of `m`**: The value of `m` should remain as it is because the loop itself does not change the value of `m`.

6. **Other variables**: The variables `arr`, `arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i]`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the only adjustments needed are for the variables `i` and `m` to ensure the loop can start executing.

**State:**
**`i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than 0**
