Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be 0, `m` will be less than or equal to 1, `arr[i - 1]` will be equal to `nums[0]` if no swap was made during the last iteration, and `arr[i]` will be unchanged or adjusted according to the loop conditions. `ans` will be `False` if any swap was made during the iterations that caused `nums` to be unsorted, otherwise, `ans` will remain `True` if no such condition was met.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached 0, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the array `arr` from `m-1` down to 1. The variable `m` will be reduced to a value less than or equal to 1, as the loop decrements `m` by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 1. The element `arr[i - 1]` will be updated to the first digit of `nums` if a swap was necessary to ensure the digits of `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` are in non-decreasing order. The `ans` variable will be `False` if any swap led to `nums` being unsorted, meaning the digits were not in ascending order after the swap. Otherwise, `ans` will remain `True` if all swaps maintained the order of the digits.
