Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that the element at index `i-1` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order and `ans` is `True`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `False` and `nums` is not sorted in non-decreasing order.
