Output State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, and `arr[i-1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr[i]` is the last element in `nums`; `ans` is False.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect any of the other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the conditions and values of `arr`, `i`, `nums`, `arr[i-1]`, and `arr[i]` remain unchanged.
