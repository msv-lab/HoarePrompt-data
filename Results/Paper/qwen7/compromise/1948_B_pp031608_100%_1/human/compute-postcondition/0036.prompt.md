Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is True, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` is False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, assuming the if condition `arr[i] < arr[i-1]` is true. If the if condition is false, `ans` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` remains False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, and `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by the current value of `arr[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` remains False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, and `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` and the current value of `arr[i]` converted to integers, and if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be the first digit of `nums`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
