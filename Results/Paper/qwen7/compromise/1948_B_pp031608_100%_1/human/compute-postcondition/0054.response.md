Postcondition: `i` is between 1 and `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and if the elements of `nums` are sorted, the conditions remain the same as the precondition; if the elements of `nums` are not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
