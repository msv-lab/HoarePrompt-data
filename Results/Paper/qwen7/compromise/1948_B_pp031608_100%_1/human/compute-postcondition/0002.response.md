Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive); `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input to the variable `m`. The precondition that `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive) remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new variable `m` with the value of the integer input, while the range constraint for `n` is still valid.
