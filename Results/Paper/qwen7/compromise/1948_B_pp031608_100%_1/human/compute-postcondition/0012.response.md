Output State: **`ans` is False, `m` must be a positive integer, `i` must be at least 0, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the last digit of `arr[i-1]`, and the list `nums` contains the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned in the initial state, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
