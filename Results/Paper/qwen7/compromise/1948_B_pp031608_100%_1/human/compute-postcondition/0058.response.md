Output State: **`i` is between 1 and `m-2`, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first element of `nums`, `arr[i]` is the second element of `nums`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to `False`. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the conditions and values of `i`, `m`, `arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i]`, and `nums` remain unchanged from the initial state.
