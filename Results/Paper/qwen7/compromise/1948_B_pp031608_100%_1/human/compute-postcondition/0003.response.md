Output State: **`n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive); `m` is an input integer; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by splitting the input string using spaces and converting each element to an integer. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
