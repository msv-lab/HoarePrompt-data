Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to make the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters such that the string no longer contains the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The program counts the number of times the substring "map" appears in the string `s`.
   - It then removes all instances of "map" from the string.
   - Finally, it counts the number of times the substring "pie" appears in the modified string and prints the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie".

3. **Flaws in Current Logic**:
   - Removing all instances of "map" does not guarantee that the resulting string will not contain "pie". For example, in the string "mappie", after removing "map", the remaining string is "pie", which still contains "pie".
   - The program does not account for overlapping occurrences of "pie" and "map". For instance, in the string "mappie", removing "map" leaves "pie", which still needs to be removed.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The program should iterate through the string and remove characters to ensure that neither "pie" nor "map" remains in the string.
   - A more effective approach would involve iterating through the string and skipping characters when "pie" or "map" is encountered, ensuring the minimal number of deletions.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
