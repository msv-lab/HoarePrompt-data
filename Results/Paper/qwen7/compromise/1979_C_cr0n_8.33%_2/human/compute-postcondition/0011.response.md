Based on the initial state provided:

- `vals` is a list of integers.
- `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `vals`.
- `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
- `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`, and it is stated that `den` is greater than 0.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process:

1. Each element in `vprod` is calculated as `prod / val[i]` where `val[i]` is the i-th element in the list `vals`.

2. The `print` statement uses a list comprehension to convert each element in `vprod` to a string and then joins them with spaces.

Given this, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod`.

Output: **what is printed** (where "what is printed" is a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod`, each element being `prod / val[i]` for each `val[i]` in `vals`).
