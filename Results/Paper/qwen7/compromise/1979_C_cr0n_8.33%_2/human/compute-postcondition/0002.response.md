Output State: **`prod` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, the list `k` contains `N` integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The line `prod = 1` initializes the variable `prod` to 1. No other changes are made to the other variables (`t`, `N`, `k`, `vals`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
