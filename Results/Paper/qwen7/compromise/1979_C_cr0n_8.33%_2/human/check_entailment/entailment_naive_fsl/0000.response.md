Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program attempts to distribute the coins based on the product of all multipliers, which is not a valid approach according to the problem description.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
3
3 2 7
```

According to the problem description, we need to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. However, the program calculates the product of all multipliers and then distributes the coins based on that product, which does not guarantee that the condition will be met for all outcomes.

A correct approach would involve finding a distribution of coins such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the reward for each outcome. The provided solution does not ensure this condition is met for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
