Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1()` is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `vprod`:**
   - The program calculates `vprod` as `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`. This means it divides the product of all multipliers by each individual multiplier. However, this does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.
   
2. **Incorrect Determination of `den`:**
   - The variable `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`. This calculation is not relevant to the problem's requirements. The goal is to find a distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome, not to subtract something from the product.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Cases:**
   - The program prints `-1` if `den` is less than or equal to 0, but this condition is not correctly checking whether a valid distribution of bets exists. It should check if the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to find a way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. One approach is to use a binary search or a greedy algorithm to find such a distribution. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    max_val = max(vals)
    lower_bound = 1
    upper_bound = 10**10  # A large enough upper bound

    while lower_bound < upper_bound:
        mid = (lower_bound + upper_bound) // 2
        total_bet = sum(mid // val for val in vals)
        if total_bet < mid * min(vals):
            upper_bound = mid
        else:
            lower_bound = mid + 1

    if lower_bound == 10**10:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(str(lower_bound // val) for val in vals))

cases = int(input())
for _ in range(cases):
    func_1()
```

This code uses a binary search to find the smallest possible total bet that is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. If no such distribution exists, it prints `-1`.
