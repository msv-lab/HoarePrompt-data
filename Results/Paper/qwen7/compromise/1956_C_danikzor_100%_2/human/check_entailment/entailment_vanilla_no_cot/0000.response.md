Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum of the matrix. Additionally, performing the same permutation twice (once for rows and once for columns) will not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix. The problem requires setting specific values in the matrix to maximize its sum, not just applying permutations.

The correct approach involves setting the diagonal elements of the matrix to the highest possible values using at most 2n operations. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print(n * n, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Set the i-th row to [i, i+1, ..., n, 1, 2, ..., i-1]
        print(1, i, *[j for j in range(i, n + 1)] + [*range(1, i)])
        # Set the i-th column to [i, i+1, ..., n, 1, 2, ..., i-1]
        print(2, i, *[j for j in range(i, n + 1)] + [*range(1, i)])
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum sum of the matrix and performs the required operations to achieve it.
