Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, the program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix, which is \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \).
- The program also correctly prints the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \).
- For each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), the program performs two operations:
  - A Type 1 operation where the elements in the \( i \)-th row are set to the permutation from \( n \) down to 1.
  - A Type 2 operation where the elements in the \( i \)-th column are set to the permutation from \( n \) down to 1.
- These operations ensure that the sum of the matrix is maximized as each element \( a_{i, j} \) will be assigned the largest possible values.

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the program correctly implements the solution as described.

Correctness: **True**
