Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, and the following outputs are produced:
- For each i from 1 to n (inclusive), two lines are printed:
  1. A line starting with 1, followed by i and then the numbers from n down to 1.
  2. A line starting with 2, followed by i and then the numbers from n down to 1.
