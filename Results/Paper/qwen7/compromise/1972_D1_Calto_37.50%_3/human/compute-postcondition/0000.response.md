Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while b:`. The only variable involved here is `b`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `b` is non-zero (`b != 0`).

3. **Current State Before the Loop**: According to the given state, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). However, the specific values of `a` and `b` do not affect the condition for the loop to execute the first time because the loop depends solely on `b`.

4. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute the first time, `b` must be non-zero. Since `b` is a positive integer and \(1 \leq b \leq m\), it is already guaranteed that `b` is non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `b`.

5. **Conclusion**: The state right before the loop remains unchanged because the loop will execute as long as `b` is non-zero, which is already satisfied by the given conditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\)**
