Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic in `func_1` correctly implements the game rules and determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
1. **Sum of Lengths Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total length of the numbers in the list by converting each number to a string and summing their lengths.
   - This part is correct because the length of the string representation of a number directly corresponds to the number of digits in that number.

2. **Zero Count Calculation**:
   - The function uses `zerocnts` to count the number of trailing zeros in each number.
   - These counts are then sorted in descending order and every second count is subtracted from the total length.
   - This step is intended to simulate the effect of Anna's moves (reversing digits) and Sasha's moves (concatenating two numbers).

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - If the resulting total length is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), the function returns 'Sasha'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'Anna'.

### Game Rules Recap:
- **Anna's Move**: Reverse the digits of a chosen number. This operation does not change the number of digits but may affect the order of digits.
- **Sasha's Move**: Concatenate two different numbers. This operation reduces the number of elements in the list by one.

### Key Insight:
- The critical insight is that the total length of the numbers in the list after optimal play should be considered. If this length is large enough, Sasha can force a win by concatenating numbers to form a large number.
- The logic of subtracting every second zero count is a heuristic to approximate the effect of Anna's reversals on the total length.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the provided logic, the function `func_1` correctly implements the game rules and the winning condition. The heuristic used to approximate the effect of Anna's moves on the total length is reasonable and aligns with the optimal play strategy.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
