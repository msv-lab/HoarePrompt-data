You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, nums):

    tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)

        tot += 1
    return tot



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, nums))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of integers in the list, m is an integer representing the parameter determining when Sasha wins, and nums is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `cntvals` is a list of the sorted counts of zeros in each integer of `nums`, excluding every second count in descending order; `tot` is the sum of the lengths of the string representations of each integer in `nums` minus the counts at even indices; `n` is an integer representing the number of integers in the list; `m` is an integer representing the parameter determining when Sasha wins; `nums` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #The program returns 'Sasha' if the sum of the lengths of the string representations of each integer in `nums` minus the counts at even indices is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n`, representing the number of integers in the list `nums`; `m`, representing the threshold for Sasha to win; and `nums`, a list of integers between 1 and 10^9. It calculates the sum of the lengths of the string representations of each integer in `nums`, subtracting the counts of zeros at even indices. If this result is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, it returns 'Sasha', otherwise it returns 'Anna'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer in the range 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9.
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':

    #State: Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer in the range 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9; `tot` is the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.
    return tot
    #The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `num` in the range 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9, converts it to a string, and counts the number of trailing zeros. It then returns this count.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves Sasha and Anna taking turns to modify a list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of an integer.
   - Sasha concatenates two integers.
   - The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, and the remaining integer is checked against \(10^m\).
   - The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to determine the winner based on the total length of the numbers and their zero counts.
   - `tot` calculates the total length of the numbers after reversing Anna's moves.
   - `cntvals` sorts the zero counts of the numbers in descending order.
   - The loop subtracts every other zero count from `tot`, effectively simulating Sasha's moves where he can concatenate smaller numbers to form larger ones.
   - The condition `tot >= m + 1` determines the winner.

3. **Analyzing `zerocnts`:**
   - This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number.
   - It converts the number to a string, iterates backward to find the first non-zero digit, and counts the zeros before it.

### Checking the Logic

1. **Zero Counts Calculation:**
   - The `zerocnts` function correctly calculates the number of trailing zeros.
   - This information is used to simulate Sasha's strategy of concatenating numbers to form larger ones.

2. **Total Length Calculation:**
   - The `tot` variable sums the lengths of the numbers after reversing Anna's moves.
   - Subtracting every other zero count simulates Sasha's moves, but this logic might be flawed because it doesn't fully capture the complexity of the game.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - The condition `tot >= m + 1` checks if the remaining number is large enough for Sasha to win.
   - However, this condition only considers the total length and zero counts, ignoring the actual values and the strategic nature of the game.

### Testing with Example Cases

Let's test the function with the provided examples to see if it behaves as expected:

```python
# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (2, 2, [14, 2]),
    (3, 5, [9, 56, 1]),
    (4, 10, [1, 2007, 800, 1580]),
    (4, 5, [5000, 123, 30, 4]),
    (10, 10, [6, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1, 10, 9, 10, 7]),
    (1, 1, [6]),
    (1, 10, [10]),
    (8, 9, [1, 2, 9, 10, 10, 2, 10, 2]),
    (4, 5, [10, 10, 10, 10])
]

# Expected results
expected_results = ["Sasha", "Anna", "Anna", "Sasha", "Sasha", "Anna", "Anna", "Anna", "Sasha"]

# Running the tests
results = []
for n, m, nums in test_cases:
    result = func_1(n, m, nums)
    results.append(result)

print(results == expected_results)
```

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and testing, the provided function does not correctly simulate the game's logic. The function incorrectly determines the winner by only considering the total length and zero counts, without accounting for the actual values and strategic moves.
