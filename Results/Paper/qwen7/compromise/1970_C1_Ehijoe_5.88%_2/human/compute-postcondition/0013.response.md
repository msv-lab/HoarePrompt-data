Based on the initial state provided:

- `empty` is `False`
- `t` remains the same input integer
- `u` and `v` are integers that were processed during the loop
- `n` remains an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5`
- `tree` is a deque containing integers `u` and `v` from the input
- `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`
- `moves` is a list containing two elements, each element being the minimum of `t` and either `idx` or `n - idx - 1`. All elements in `moves` are even.

The print statement is simply printing the string `'Hermione'`.

Output: **Hermione**
