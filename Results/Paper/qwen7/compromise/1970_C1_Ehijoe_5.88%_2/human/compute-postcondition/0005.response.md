Output State: `empty` is False, `t` remains the same input integer, `u` and `v` are integers that were processed during the loop, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `tree` is a deque containing integers `u` and `v` from the input, with their positions determined by the conditions in the loop.
