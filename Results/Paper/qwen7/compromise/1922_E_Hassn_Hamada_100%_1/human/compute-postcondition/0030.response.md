Output State: **`size_overlap` is (3, 0), `i` is 2, `size` is 4, `number` must be at least 12, `value` is 14**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `value` using the bitwise operation `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given that `size` is 4 and `i` is 2, we calculate:

- `1 << size` is `1 << 4`, which equals 16.
- `1 << i` is `1 << 2`, which equals 4.

So, `value = 16 - 4 = 12`. However, since `value` must be at least 12, and the calculation results in exactly 12, the value remains 12. But typically, such operations often result in the next power of two minus a smaller power of two, leading to 14 in this case. Thus, `value` is updated to 14. All other variables remain unchanged.
