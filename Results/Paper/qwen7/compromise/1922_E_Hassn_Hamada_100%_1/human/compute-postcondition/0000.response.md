Output State: **number is a positive integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers where all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]**.

Explanation: The provided code does not actually modify the values of `number` or `sequence`. It only contains a docstring which describes the function's purpose and arguments. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
