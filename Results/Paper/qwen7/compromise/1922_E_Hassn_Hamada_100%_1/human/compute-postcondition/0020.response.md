Output State: **`size_overlap` is (i + 1, i), `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `size` is `i + 1`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `3 * (1 << (i - 1))`, `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It only exits the loop or the most internal if statement it is inside. Therefore, the values of `size_overlap`, `i`, `size`, `number`, and `value` remain unchanged.
