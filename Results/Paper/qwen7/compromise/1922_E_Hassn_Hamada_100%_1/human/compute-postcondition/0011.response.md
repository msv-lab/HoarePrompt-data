Output State: **`size_overlap` is (2, 0), `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `3 * (1 << i)`**

Explanation: The line `size += 1` increments the first element of the tuple `size_overlap` by 1. Initially, `size_overlap` is `(1, 0)`. After executing the code, `size_overlap` becomes `(2, 0)`. The other variables (`i`, `size`, `value`, and `number`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
