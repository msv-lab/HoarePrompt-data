Output State: `size` is 25, `overlap` is 3, `i` is 25, `sequence` contains [6, 7, 8, ..., 30].

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = size - overlap`, which is `25 - 3 = 22`. Therefore, the loop will execute 22 times. Starting with `i = 3`, each iteration increments `i` by 1, so after 22 iterations, `i` will be `3 + 22 = 25`. Each iteration also appends `i + overlap` (which is `i + 3`) to the `sequence` list, starting from 6 and ending at 30. Thus, the final `sequence` will contain all integers from 6 to 30.
