Output State: **`size` is 25, `overlap` is 3, `i` is 25, `sequence` contains [6, 7, 8, ..., 30], `number` is number - (1 << 25) + (1 << 3)**.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = 22`, appending `i + 3` to the `sequence` list each time. After the loop, the function `func_1` is called with the arguments `number - (1 << 25) + (1 << 3)` and `sequence`. Since the values of `size` and `overlap` are unchanged, they remain as `25` and `3` respectively. The value of `i` remains `25` because the loop does not modify it further. The `sequence` list is updated to contain all integers from `6` to `30`. The variable `number` is modified by the function call to `number - (1 << 25) + (1 << 3)`.
