Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the parameters passed to `range()`. Specifically, the loop runs from `max(sequence, default=0)` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `size_overlap` is (21, 2)
   - `i` is 2
   - `size` is 21
   - `number` must be at least 2044
   - `value` is 2046

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `max(sequence, default=0)` to `-1` in steps of `-1`. This means `i` starts from the maximum value of `sequence` (or 0 if `sequence` is empty) and decrements until it reaches `-1`.

4. **Check the current value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

5. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `2 - 1 = 1`.

6. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than or equal to `max(sequence, default=0)`. Given that `i` is now 1, `max(sequence, default=0)` must be less than or equal to 1 for the loop to continue.

7. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `size_overlap`, `size`, `number`, and `value` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`size_overlap` is (21, 2), `i` is 1, `size` is 21, `number` must be at least 2044, and `value` is 2046**
