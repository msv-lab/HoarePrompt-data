Output State: **`size_overlap` is (21, 2), `i` is 2, `size` is 22, `number` must be greater than or equal to 4194296, `value` is 2, `value` is 4194294**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `value` to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given `size` is 22 and `i` is 2, `1 << size` equals \(2^{22}\) which is 4194304, and `1 << i` equals \(2^2\) which is 4. Therefore, `value` becomes \(4194304 - 4 = 4194294\). All other variables remain unchanged.
