Output State: `size_overlap` is (3, 0), `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `size` is `i + 1`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `3 * (1 << (i - 1))`, `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be incremented until the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number` is no longer satisfied. From the given information, we can see that after 3 iterations, `i` is at least 2. The loop will continue to increment `i` as long as the condition holds. However, since the exact value of `number` is not provided, we know that it must be less than `3 * (1 << (i - 1))` when the loop terminates. Given that `i` is at least 2, the final state will have `size` as `i + 1`, which means `size` is at least 3. The `value` is updated to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, which simplifies to `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)` when `i` is at least 2. The `size_overlap` remains (3, 0) as it was not affected by the loop.
