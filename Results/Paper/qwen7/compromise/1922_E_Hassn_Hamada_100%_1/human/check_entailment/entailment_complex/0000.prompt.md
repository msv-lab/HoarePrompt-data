Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #
    #This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `size_overlap` has been updated to (25, 3). This means that the final values of `size` and `i` that satisfy the condition within the loop are 25 and 3, respectively. The variable `i` is set to 3 after the loop completes, and `size` is calculated as `i + 1`, which equals 25. Additionally, the condition for `number` must be met, which is being greater than or equal to 4194296. The value of `value` is 33554430, which is the result of the calculation `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` when `size` is 25 and `i` is 3.
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: Output State: `size` is 25, `overlap` is 3, `i` is 25, `sequence` contains [6, 7, 8, ..., 30].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = size - overlap`, which is `25 - 3 = 22`. Therefore, the loop will execute 22 times. Starting with `i = 3`, each iteration increments `i` by 1, so after 22 iterations, `i` will be `3 + 22 = 25`. Each iteration also appends `i + overlap` (which is `i + 3`) to the `sequence` list, starting from 6 and ending at 30. Thus, the final `sequence` will contain all integers from 6 to 30.
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `number` (where \(2 \leq number \leq 10^{18}\)) and a list of integers `sequence`. It generates a new sequence based on the input `number` and updates the `sequence` list. If `number` is 0, it returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a pair of values (`size` and `i`) and uses them to fill the `sequence` list with specific integers. Finally, it recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. The function ultimately returns two zeros, regardless of the input values.
