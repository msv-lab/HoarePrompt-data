### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The solution uses a recursive function `func_1` to generate this array.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bit manipulation to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The goal is to create a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the target `X`.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When `number == 0`, the function returns immediately, indicating the base case of the recursion.

4. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function iterates backward from the maximum value in the current sequence to 0.
   - For each value `i`, it calculates the size and value of the next segment of the sequence.
   - It checks if the calculated value fits within the remaining `number` and updates the sequence accordingly.
   - The function recursively calls itself with the updated `number` and appends the generated segment to the sequence.

5. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values that ensure the number of increasing subsequences matches the target `X`.
   - The sequence is constructed using powers of 2, which helps in ensuring the correct count of increasing subsequences.

6. **Output**:
   - The length of the generated sequence is printed first.
   - Then, the sequence is printed as space-separated integers.

### Verification:

- The function correctly handles the base case when `number == 0`.
- The recursive function ensures that the sequence is built in a way that matches the target number of increasing subsequences.
- The sequence generation logic is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

### Correctness:

**True**
