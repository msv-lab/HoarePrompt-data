Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the decoding process. Here's why:

1. **Mapping Construction**: The function attempts to construct a mapping from characters in the encoded string to characters in the alphabet. However, the logic for constructing this mapping is flawed. Specifically, it tries to find the next available character in the alphabet that is not already used in the mapping. This approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that the mapping is consistent with the original encoding process.

2. **Decoding Process**: After constructing the mapping, the function tries to decode the `encoded` string using this mapping. However, since the mapping is constructed incorrectly, the decoded string will not match the original string `s`.

To correctly decode the string, we need to follow these steps:
- Construct the auxiliary string `r` (which consists of all distinct letters of the string `s` in alphabetical order).
- Create a reverse mapping from `r` to the original characters in `s`.
- Use this reverse mapping to decode the `encoded` string.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    # Step 1: Construct the auxiliary string r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    
    # Step 2: Create a reverse mapping from r to the original characters in s
    mapping = {char: r[i] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    
    # Step 3: Decode the encoded string using the reverse mapping
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    
    return decoded
```

Given the above reasoning, the provided function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
