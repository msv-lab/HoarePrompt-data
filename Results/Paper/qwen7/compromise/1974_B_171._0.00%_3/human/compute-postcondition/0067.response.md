Output State: **The dictionary `mapping` contains mappings for all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z', with each letter being mapped to a unique character, and the variable `c` is equal to 122.**

Explanation: The loop iterates through all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', assigning each letter to `chr(c)`, where `c` starts from the ASCII value of 'a' and increments by 1 for each iteration. After completing the loop, `c` will be equal to the ASCII value of 'z', which is 122. The dictionary `mapping` will contain mappings for all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', with each letter mapping to a unique character.
