Output State: **`c` is 97, `mapping` is a dictionary with key 'a' and value `char`, the character corresponding to `c` is not in the values of `mapping`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this scenario, since there is no loop or match-case structure present, the `break` statement does not alter any variable values or the state of the dictionary. Therefore, the values of `c`, `mapping`, and the condition regarding the character corresponding to `c` remain unchanged.
