Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):`. The variable being iterated over is `c`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `c` is 98 and the character 'b' is not in the values of `mapping`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `c`**: The `range` function generates values from `ord('a')` (which is 97) to `ord('z')` (which is 122). Since `c` is currently 98, the next value in the sequence would be 99.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to update the state such that `c` is set to the next value in the sequence, which is 99. The condition about the character 'b' not being in the values of `mapping` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`c` is 99, and the character 'b' is not in the values of `mapping`**.
