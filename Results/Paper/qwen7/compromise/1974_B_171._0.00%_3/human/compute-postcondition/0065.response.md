Output State: The dictionary `mapping` contains mappings for all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z', with each letter being mapped to a unique character in the `decoded` list, except for the first two characters of the original `encoded` string which were not included in the mappings.

Explanation: Since the loop continues to execute for each character in the sequence from 'a' to 'z', it will eventually map every lowercase Latin letter to a unique character in the `decoded` list. This process ensures that by the end of the loop, `mapping` will have entries for all 26 lowercase letters, and the `decoded` list will contain all characters from the original `encoded` string, except the first two characters which were not included in the mappings.
