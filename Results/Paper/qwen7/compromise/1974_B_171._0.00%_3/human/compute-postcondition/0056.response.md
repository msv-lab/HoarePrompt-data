Output State: **`c` is the ASCII value of the next character in the sequence from 'a' to 'z', and the character represented by `chr(c)` is now mapped to `char` in the dictionary `mapping`.**

Explanation: The code `mapping[chr(c)] = char` updates the dictionary `mapping` by setting the key as the character represented by the ASCII value `c` (which is the next character in the sequence from 'a' to 'z') and the value as `char`. The initial state of `c` remains unchanged, and the character corresponding to `c` is now stored in the dictionary with the key `char`.
