Output State: **`c` is the ASCII value of the next character in the sequence from 'a' to 'z'; `mapping[chr(c)]` is assigned the value of `char`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the dictionary `mapping`. Here, `c` is the ASCII value of the next character in the sequence from 'a' to 'z', and `chr(c)` is the corresponding character. The variable `mapping` is updated with this assignment, but no other variables are affected.
