Output State: **`c` is an integer; `mapping` is a dictionary where the key `chr(c)` is associated with the value `char`; the character represented by `chr(c)` is not in the values of the dictionary `mapping` before the assignment but is after the assignment.**

This means that the dictionary `mapping` now contains the key `chr(c)` with the value `char`. All other conditions remain the same as the initial state, with `c` being an integer and the character represented by `chr(c)` not previously in the values of `mapping`.
