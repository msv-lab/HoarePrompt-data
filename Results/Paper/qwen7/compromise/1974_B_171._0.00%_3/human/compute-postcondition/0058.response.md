Postcondition: `c` is the ASCII value of the next character in the sequence from 'a' to 'z', and the character represented by `chr(c)` is either not in the values of the dictionary `mapping` or is mapped to `char` in the dictionary `mapping`. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
