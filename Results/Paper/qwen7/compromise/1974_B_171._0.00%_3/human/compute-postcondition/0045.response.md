Output State: **`c` is 122, `decoded` contains the character 'z', and 'z' is added to the `mapping` dictionary if it does not already exist.**

Explanation: The code `decoded.append(chr(c))` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `c` to the list `decoded`. Given that `c` is 122 (which is the ASCII value for 'z'), the character 'z' is appended to `decoded`. Additionally, the condition for adding 'z' to the `mapping` dictionary is met, assuming it does not already exist in the values of `mapping`.
