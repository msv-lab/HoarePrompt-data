Output State: **`c0` is 1 + `coef0[j]`, `c1` is 1 + `coef1[j]`, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1, `j` is the next element in `nodes` (after the previous `j`), `nodes` has one less element**.

Explanation: The variable `c0` is updated by adding `coef0[j]` to its current value. Given that `c0` was initially 1, the new value of `c0` becomes `1 + coef0[j]`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
