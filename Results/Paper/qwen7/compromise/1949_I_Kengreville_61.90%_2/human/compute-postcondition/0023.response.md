Output State: **`dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `j` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`, `visited[j]` must be false.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `y[i] - y[j]` to `dy`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `dx` remains `x[i] - x[j]`, `j` remains `k + 1`, `n` must still be greater than `k + 1`, and `visited[j]` must still be false.
