Output State: **`nodes` is an empty list, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in the original `nodes`, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The `dfs(i)` function call is made with `i` being 2. However, without the definition of the `dfs` function, we cannot determine the exact changes to the variables. Since no modifications to `nodes`, `c1`, `ok`, `i`, `coef0[1]`, or `coef1[1]` are mentioned within the given code snippet, these variables retain their initial states. The `dfs` function might modify the state of the program further, but since the function definition is not provided, we can only state that the variables remain unchanged based on the provided information.
