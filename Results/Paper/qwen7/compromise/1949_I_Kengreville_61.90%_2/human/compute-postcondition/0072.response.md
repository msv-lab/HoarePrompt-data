Output State: **`c0` is 1, `c1` is 1, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1, `j` is the next element in `nodes`.**

Explanation: The code updates `c0` by adding the value of `coef0[j]` to it. Given that `c0` was initially 0, after adding `coef0[j]`, which is 0, `c0` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
