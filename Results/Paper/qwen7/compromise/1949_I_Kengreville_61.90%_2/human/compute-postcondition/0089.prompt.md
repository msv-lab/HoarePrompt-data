You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, x and y are lists of n integers each, representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks respectively, and r is a list of n integers, representing the radii of the disks respectively.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is an integer value input by the user. The variable `i` is equal to `n`. `coef1` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `None`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values with all elements set to `False`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x`, `y`, and `r` will contain the integer values provided by the user for each index up to `n-1`. The loop has incremented `i` to `n`, indicating that all elements in `x`, `y`, and `r` have been populated. All other variables (`coef1`, `coef0`, `nodes`, and `visited`) remain in their initial state as they were not modified within the loop.
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: All elements in `coef0` and `coef1` are either 0 or 1, `nodes` contains a list of all nodes that were visited during the execution of the loop, `c0` and `c1` are sums of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` for each node `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is True if the sum of `coef1[j]` for any `j` in `nodes` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 1000), `x` (a list of `n` integers representing x-coordinates), `y` (a list of `n` integers representing y-coordinates), and `r` (a list of `n` integers representing radii). The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
