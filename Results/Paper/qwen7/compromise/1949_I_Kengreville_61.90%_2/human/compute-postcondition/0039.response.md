Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `ok` is now `ok or (coef1[0] + coef1[1] + ... + coef1[k]) != 0`, `coef0[0]` is 0, `coef1[0]` is 1, `nodes` is a list containing node 0, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`.
