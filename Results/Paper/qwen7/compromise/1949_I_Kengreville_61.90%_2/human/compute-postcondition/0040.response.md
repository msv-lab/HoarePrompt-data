Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `ok` is `ok or (coef1[0] + coef1[1] + ... + coef1[k]) != 0`.
   - `coef0[0]` is 0.
   - `coef1[0]` is 1.
   - `nodes` is a list containing node 0.
   - `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`.
   - `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will increment `i` by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant defined before the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` remains the same (a positive integer).

6. **Post-Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The postcondition for the next iteration should reflect the updated state of `i` and the unchanged state of `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `ok` is `ok or (coef1[0] + coef1[1] + ... + coef1[k]) != 0`, `coef0[0]` is 0, `coef1[0]` is 1, `nodes` is a list containing node 0, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` values for each node `j` in the list `nodes`.**
