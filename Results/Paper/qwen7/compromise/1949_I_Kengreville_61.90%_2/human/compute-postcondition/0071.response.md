Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `j` and it iterates over `nodes`.

2. **Determine the initial states at the start of the loop**: 
   - `c0` is 0
   - `c1` is 1
   - `ok` remains unchanged (no specific value given, so we keep it as is)
   - `i` is 2
   - `coef0[1]` is 0
   - `coef1[1]` is 1

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `nodes` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is iterating over `nodes`, the only variables that change are `j` itself and potentially the length of `nodes`.
   - `c0`, `c1`, `ok`, `i`, `coef0[1]`, and `coef1[1]` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be the next element in `nodes` (assuming `nodes` is not empty).
   - `nodes` will have one less element since `j` is being processed.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`c0` is 0, `c1` is 1, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1, `j` is the next element in `nodes`, `nodes` must have at least one less element than before**. 

However, since the exact value of `j` and the updated length of `nodes` are not provided, we can only express it in a general form:

State: **`c0` is 0, `c1` is 1, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1, `j` is the next element in `nodes`, `nodes` must have at least one less element than before**.
