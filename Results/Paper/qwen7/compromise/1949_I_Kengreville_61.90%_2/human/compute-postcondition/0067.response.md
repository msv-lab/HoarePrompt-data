Output State: **`nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0, `c1` is 0, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `c1 = 0` assigns the value 0 to `c1`. Since `c1` was previously the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in the original `nodes`, and `nodes` is an empty list, the sum was already 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
