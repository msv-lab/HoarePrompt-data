Postcondition: **`nodes` must contain at least three elements, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in `nodes`, `ok` is True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.**

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `nodes` will still contain at least three elements, `c1` will be the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` will be True if `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` will remain unchanged.
