Output State: **`nodes` must have at least two elements, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` where `j` is the first element in the updated `nodes` list.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `c1` by adding `coef1[j]` where `j` is the first element in the `nodes` list. The initial state of `nodes` having at least two elements and `c0` being increased by `coef0[j]` where `j` is the first element in the updated `nodes` list remains unchanged except for the new value of `c1`.
