Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` and `y` are lists of length `n` containing the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the centers of the disks respectively, `r` is a list of length `n` containing the initial radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`, `nodes` is a list with the element `i` appended, and `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length `n` initialized to zeros.**

The code `nodes.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `nodes`. Since `i` is not defined in the context of the initial state, it is assumed to be a variable that holds a specific integer value. After appending, the list `nodes` now contains the element `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
