Postcondition: **All elements in `coef0` and `coef1` are either 0 or 1, `nodes` contains a list of all nodes that were visited during the execution of the loop, `c0` and `c1` are sums of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` for each node `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is True since the sum of `coef1[j]` for any `j` in `nodes` is not equal to 0.**
