Output State: **`coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`, `j` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `k + 1`, `visited[j]` is false, `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`, the function `dfs(j)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `dfs(j)` calls the function `dfs` with the argument `j`. This function call does not directly modify the values of the variables `coef0[j]`, `dx`, `dy`, `j`, `n`, `visited[j]`, or `coef1[j]`. Instead, it performs operations within the function `dfs`. Since no specific details about what `dfs(j)` does are provided, we can only state that the function has been called with the given argument. All other variables retain their previous states.
