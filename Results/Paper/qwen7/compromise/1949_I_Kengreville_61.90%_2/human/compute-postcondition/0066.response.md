Output State: **`nodes` is an empty list, `c0` is 0, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for every `j` in the original `nodes`, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `c0 = 0` initializes `c0` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
