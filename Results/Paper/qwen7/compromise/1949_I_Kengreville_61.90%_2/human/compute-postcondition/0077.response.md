Output State: `c0` is the sum of all values in `coef0` for each `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all values in `coef1` for each `j` in `nodes`, `ok` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `coef0[1]` is 0, `coef1[1]` is 1, `nodes` is an empty list.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `c0` will hold the sum of all coefficients from `coef0` corresponding to the indices present in `nodes`, and `c1` will hold the sum of all coefficients from `coef1` corresponding to the same indices. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 2, `coef0[1]` and `coef1[1]` remain as initially given, and `nodes` becomes an empty list since all elements have been iterated over.
