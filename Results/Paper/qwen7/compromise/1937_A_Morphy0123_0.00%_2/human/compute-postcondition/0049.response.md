Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`.
2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is greater than 2, and `power` has been increased by 1.
3. **Analyze the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.
   - Since `power` has been increased by 1 in the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `power` must still be less than `log2(n)` in this iteration.

Given that `power` has been increased by 1, the new value of `power` is `power + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `power + 1` must be less than `log2(n)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `power` must be adjusted to reflect its new value after the increase.
   - The variable `n` must be adjusted to ensure that the loop condition `power < log2(n)` holds true for the next iteration.

Since `power` was increased by 1 in the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `power` as `power_new = power + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the end of the current iteration should be:

- `power` is now `power + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than 2 (as given in the initial state).

So, the final state to proceed to the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`power` is `power + 1`, `n` is greater than 2**
