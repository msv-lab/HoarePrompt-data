The variables in the loop head are `power` and `log2(n)`, so we can only adjust these two variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `power < log2(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is `power + 2`, and `n` is greater than 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < log2(n)` must be true. Since `power` is incremented by 2 in each iteration, we need to ensure that `power` is still less than `log2(n)`.

Given that `power` was `power + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `power` is still less than `log2(n)`. This means `log2(n)` must be greater than the new value of `power`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `log2(n)` is greater than the new value of `power`.

State: **`power` is `power + 2`, `log2(n)` must be greater than `power`**
