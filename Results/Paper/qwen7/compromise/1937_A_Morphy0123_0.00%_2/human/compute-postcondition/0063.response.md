Postcondition: `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is incremented by either 1 or 2, and `n_cases` remains unchanged. `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. If `n` is 1, then `power` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `power` is adjusted based on whether it equals `n` or is greater than or equal to 16384, ensuring it is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.
