Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `power` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `power` is currently 1.
   - `n` is an integer input by the user.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.

4. **Analyze the current values**:
   - Since `power` is 1, the condition `1 < log2(n)` must be true for the loop to execute the first time.
   - This means `log2(n)` must be greater than 1, which implies `n > 2`.

Given the current state:
- `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (this does not affect the loop condition).
- `i` is either `i + 1` (if it was 2) or `i + 2` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15) (this does not affect the loop condition).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure `log2(n) > 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2**
