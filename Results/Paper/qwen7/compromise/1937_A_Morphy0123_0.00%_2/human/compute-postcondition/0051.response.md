Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `power` is `power + 2`
   - `n` is greater than 2

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < log2(n)` must be true.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `power` is less than `log2(n)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `power` is `power + 2` (which means `power` has increased by 2 from the previous value).
   - For the loop to execute again, `power` must still be less than `log2(n)`.

Given that `power` has increased by 2, we need to ensure that `power` is still less than `log2(n)`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `power` has increased by 2, we need to ensure that `power` is still less than `log2(n)`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be such that `log2(n)` is greater than the new value of `power`.

Since `power` is `power + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `power` is the old value plus 2. To ensure the loop continues, `log2(n)` must be greater than this new value.

5. **Final state**:
   - The variable `power` has increased by 2, so we need to ensure that `n` is such that `log2(n)` is greater than the new value of `power`.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 2 (as given in the current state).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `n` must be such that `log2(n)` is greater than the new value of `power`.

**State**: **`power` is `power + 2`, `n` must be such that `log2(n)` is greater than the new value of `power`**
