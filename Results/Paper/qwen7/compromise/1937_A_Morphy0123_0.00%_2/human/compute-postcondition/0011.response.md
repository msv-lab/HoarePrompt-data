The variables in the loop head are `power` and `log2(n)`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `power` and `log2(n)`. If `power` is less than `log2(n)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 4. Since `n` is greater than 4, `log2(n)` will be greater than 2 (because \( \log_2(4) = 2 \)). Therefore, `power` must be less than this value for the loop to execute again.

Given that `power` is currently 3, it is already greater than 2, which means `log2(n)` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`power` is 3, `log2(n)` must be greater than 3**
