Output State: `power` is 15, `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2 (if it was 1) or `i + 1` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15), and `n` must be greater than 16384.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` until it reaches 15. Given that the loop increments `power` by 1 each iteration and the conditions provided, we can deduce that the loop will run until `power` is 15. At this point, `n` must be greater than \(2^{14}\) (which is 16384) because the loop starts when `power` is less than \(\log_2(n)\). Therefore, for the loop to continue running until `power` reaches 15, `n` must be greater than 16384.
