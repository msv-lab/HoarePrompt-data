Given the initial state:
- `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`, and currently equals `n`.
- `i` has been incremented by either 1 or 2.
- `n_cases` remains unchanged.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(2 ** power)` is executed.

From the precondition, we know that `power` is equal to `n`. Therefore, the expression `2 ** power` translates to `2 ** n`.

Output: **2 ** n**
