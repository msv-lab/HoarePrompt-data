Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input. 

- If `k` is 5999999999, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
- If `n == 2` and `k == a[0] - 1` and `k == a[1] - 2`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
- If `k` is 3000000000, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of elements in `a`, then `k` is 0, `d` is the length of `a` minus `k`, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, and `g` is the maximum index where `a[g]` is greater than 0, with `a[g]` being `int(a[g]) - 1` if `k % 2 == 1`. Otherwise, `k` is 0, `d` is the length of `a`, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, and `a` remains unchanged.
