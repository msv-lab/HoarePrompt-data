Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `z` is 0, `a` is an input string, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in `a`, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the substring after the first space in `a` to `k` after converting it to an integer. The positions of the other variables remain unchanged.
