Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is the first element of `a`, and `k` is the second element of `a`. If `n == 1`, `k == 10000000000000`, and `a[0] == 1`, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `k == 9999999999`, `k` is set to 9999999999. If `k` is 100000000000, it remains unchanged. If `k` is 10000000000000, it remains unchanged. If `k` is 99999999999999, it is set to 99999999999999. If `k` is an even number, each element in `a` (except possibly at indices `g` and `d`) is decremented by 1, and if an element at index `g` or `d` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1 or `d` is decremented by 1, respectively. If `k` is an odd number, `a[g]` is decremented by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `k` remains unchanged.
