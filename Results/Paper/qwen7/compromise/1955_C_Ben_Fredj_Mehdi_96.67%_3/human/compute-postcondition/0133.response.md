At which points in the program could an exception occur?
- An exception could occur if `a[d]` or `a[g]` cannot be converted to an integer using `int()`, or if `a[d]` or `a[g]` is 0 (which would cause an attempt to decrement it further, leading to an invalid operation).
- The `break` statement in the `except` block indicates that if any exception occurs, the program will exit the most internal loop or if statement.

Summarizing what the try except statement accomplishes:
- The `try` block attempts to decrement the elements at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` by 1 after converting them to integers. If `a[g]` or `a[d]` equals 0, `g` is incremented by 1 and `d` is decremented by 1.
- If any exception occurs during these operations, the `except` block is executed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`a` is a list where the element at index `d` is reduced by 1, `i` is `m + 1`, and `k` remains the same. If an exception occurs (such as an invalid conversion to integer or an attempt to decrement an already zero element), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
