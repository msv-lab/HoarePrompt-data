Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element (except possibly at indices `g` and `d`) has been decremented by 1 for every iteration of the loop until `i` reaches `k // 2`. If an element at index `g` or `d` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1 or `d` is decremented by 1, respectively. The loop breaks if an exception occurs during any iteration. If `k` is an odd number, `a[g]` is decremented by 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `k` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that all conditions and modifications are clearly described.
