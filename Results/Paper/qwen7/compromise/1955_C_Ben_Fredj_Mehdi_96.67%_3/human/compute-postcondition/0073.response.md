Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the first element of `a` and its value is 5.
- `k` is the second element of `a` and its value is 2147483648.
- `a` is not equal to \([1000000000, 1000000000]\).
- `k` is not equal to 99999999999999.
- `a[0]` is not equal to 1.
- `k` is not equal to 200000000000.

The print statement is:
```python
print('2')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'2'`.

Output: **2**
