Output State: **`a[g]` is the value of `a[g]` reduced by 1**.

Explanation: The code `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` ensures that the value of `a[g]` is first converted to an integer and then decreased by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `a[g]`, the only change we can definitively state is that `a[g]` is now its original value minus one.
