Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `z` is 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `n` is the first element of `a`.
- `k` is the second element of `a`.
- `n` is not equal to 1.
- `k` is not equal to 10000000000000.
- `a[0]` is not equal to 1.
- The current value of `k` is 9999999999.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'9'`.

Output: **'9'**
