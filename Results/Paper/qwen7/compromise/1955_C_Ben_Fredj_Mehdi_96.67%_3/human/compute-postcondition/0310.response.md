Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input string `a`, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 1, `g` is 0.**

The code `g = 0` initializes the variable `g` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial states.
