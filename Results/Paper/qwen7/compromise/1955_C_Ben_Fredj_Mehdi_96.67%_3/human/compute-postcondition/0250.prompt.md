Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `d` is the length of list `a` minus 1, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input received from `input()` function, `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `d` is the length of list `a` minus 2, `k` is at least 2, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input, `g` is 2, `a[d]` is 0, and `a[g]` remains unchanged. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: 

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 1` and `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`. If `a[g]` equals 0, then `g` is incremented by 1. If `a[d]` equals 0, then `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs during the execution of the `try` block, the function breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
