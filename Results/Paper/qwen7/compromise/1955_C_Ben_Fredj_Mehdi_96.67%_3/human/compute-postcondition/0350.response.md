Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `z` is 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers where the last `k // 2` elements are decreased by 1.
   - `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input string `a`.
   - `i` is `k // 2 - 1`.
   - `d` is the length of the list `a` minus `k // 2`.
   - `g` is `k // 2`.
   - If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decreased by 1.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a.count(0))
   ```

To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the list `a` and how it is modified based on the given conditions.

### Analysis:
- The value of `k` is determined from the substring after the first space in the input string `a`. Let's assume the input string `a` is `"123 456"`. Here, the substring after the first space is "456", so `k = 456`.
- `g` is `k // 2`, so `g = 456 // 2 = 228`.
- `d` is the length of the list `a` minus `k // 2`, but since `k` is very large (456), `d` will be negative, which doesn't make sense in this context. This suggests that the list `a` must have fewer elements than `k // 2`, meaning the list `a` must be quite short.
- Since `a` is a list of integers and the last `k // 2` elements are decreased by 1, and considering `k` is very large, the last few elements of `a` will be decreased by 1.
- If `k` is odd, `a[g]` is decreased by 1. Since `k = 456` is even, `a[g]` is not decreased by 1.

Given that `k` is very large and `a` is a short list, the last few elements of `a` will be decreased by 1, but since `k` is even, `a[g]` remains unchanged.

### Example with a Short List:
Assume `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (a short list for simplicity).

- `k = 456` (from the substring "456").
- `g = 456 // 2 = 228` (but since `a` only has 5 elements, this is out of bounds, so we consider the last few elements).
- The last `k // 2` elements are decreased by 1, so the last 2 elements (if `k` were smaller) would be decreased by 1.
- Since `k` is very large, the last few elements of `a` are decreased by 1, but since `a` is short, only the last element might be affected.

### Conclusion:
In the given example, the list `a` will have its last few elements decreased by 1. Given the large value of `k`, the last few elements of `a` will be decreased, but since `a` is short, only the last element might be affected. Therefore, the count of zeros in `a` will be 0 because no elements are zero.

Output: **0**
