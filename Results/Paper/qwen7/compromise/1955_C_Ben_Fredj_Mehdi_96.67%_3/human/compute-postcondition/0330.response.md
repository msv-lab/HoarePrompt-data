Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers where the last two elements are decreased by 1, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `d` is the length of the list `a` minus 2, `g` is 2, `a[g]` is a specific integer that was one less than its original value, `a[d]` is also a specific integer that was one less than its original value. If `a[g]` equals 0, then `a[g]` remains 0. Otherwise, `a[g]` is a specific integer that was one less than its original value.**
