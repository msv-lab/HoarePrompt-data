To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed in the loop:

1. **Initial State**: The list `a` has been modified by decrementing each element at indices `g` and `d` by 1 for every iteration of the loop until `i` reaches `k // 2`. If an element at index `g` or `d` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1 or `d` is decremented by 1, respectively. The loop breaks if an exception occurs during any iteration. If `k` is an odd number, `a[g]` is decremented by 1.

2. **Operations in the Loop**:
   - For each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = k // 2 - 1`:
     - Decrement `a[g]` and `a[d]` by 1.
     - If `a[g]` becomes 0, increment `g` by 1.
     - If `a[d]` becomes 0, decrement `d` by 1.
     - If an exception occurs during any iteration, the loop breaks.
   - If `k` is odd, after the loop, decrement `a[g]` by 1.

3. **Counting Zeros**:
   - We need to count how many times the elements at indices `g` and `d` have been decremented to zero.

Given these steps, let's consider the possible scenarios:

- If `k` is even, the loop runs `k // 2` times.
- If `k` is odd, the loop runs `k // 2` times, and then one additional decrement is applied to `a[g]`.

Let's assume the initial values of `a`, `g`, `d`, and `k` to illustrate the process. For simplicity, let's assume `a` starts as `[5, 5, 5, 5]`, `g = 0`, `d = 1`, and `k = 4`.

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **First Iteration (i = 0)**:
   - Decrement `a[0]` and `a[1]`: `a` becomes `[4, 4, 5, 5]`.
   - No zeros are created yet.

2. **Second Iteration (i = 1)**:
   - Decrement `a[0]` and `a[1]`: `a` becomes `[3, 3, 5, 5]`.
   - No zeros are created yet.

3. **Third Iteration (i = 2)**:
   - Decrement `a[0]` and `a[1]`: `a` becomes `[2, 2, 5, 5]`.
   - No zeros are created yet.

4. **Fourth Iteration (i = 3)**:
   - Decrement `a[0]` and `a[1]`: `a` becomes `[1, 1, 5, 5]`.
   - No zeros are created yet.

Since `k` is even, the loop ends here. There are no zeros in the list `a`.

### Final State:
- The list `a` remains `[1, 1, 5, 5]`.

### Counting Zeros:
- The count of zeros in `a` is `0`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **0**
