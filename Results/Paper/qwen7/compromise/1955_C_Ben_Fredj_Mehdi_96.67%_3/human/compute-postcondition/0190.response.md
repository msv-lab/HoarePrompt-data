Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `z` is 1, `a` is a list of integers converted from the input, `k` is the integer value of the substring after the first space in the input, `n` is the integer value of the substring before the first space in the input received from `input()` function.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input using `input()`, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The values of `t`, `z`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
