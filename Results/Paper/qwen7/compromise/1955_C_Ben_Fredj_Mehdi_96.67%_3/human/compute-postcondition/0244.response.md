Output State: **`a[d]` is `int(a[d]) - 2`, `a[g]` is `int(a[g]) - 1`. If `a[g]` equals 0, then `g` is increased by 1; `d` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d -= 1` decreases the value of `d` by 1. The value of `a[d]` was originally `int(a[d]) - 1`, so now it becomes `int(a[d]) - 2`. The value of `a[g]` remains unchanged as the code only affects `d`. If `a[g]` equals 0, then `g` is increased by 1, which is still a condition to be checked.
