Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where the array cannot be made entirely zero. Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
5
2 4 4 5 1
```

The program should output "NO" because it is impossible to make all elements zero using the given operations. However, the current implementation does not check all necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to make all elements zero. The function `func_2` only checks if the element at index `i-1` is zero after the operations but does not ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zero. This can be seen in the example above, where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros due to the imbalance in the operations applied.
