You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array elements, and n is an integer representing the number of elements in the array.
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `n`, and the function has not returned False during any iteration. This implies that for every index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `list[j]` is 0. If any `list[j]` was not 0 at any point, the function would have returned False earlier. Therefore, the final output state is that the entire list consists of zeros.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all elements in the list 'list' are 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array a, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 \* 10^5.

    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: The list becomes a series of zeros, with the exception that `list[n-1]` will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value, and all other elements will be 0. This is because the loop continuously modifies the elements as per the given conditions, eventually leaving only the first element (or the last one if we consider the reverse operation) with a negative value if it started with a non-zero value, and all others as zero.
    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- The loop starts by checking if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`.
    #- If these conditions are met, it performs the specified operations: subtracting `2 * list[i-1]` from `list[i]`, subtracting `list[i-1]` from `list[i+1]`, and subtracting `list[i-1]` from `list[i-1]`.
    #- These operations continue until either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1 or `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` is no longer greater than 0.
    #- After all iterations, the list will consist of zeros except for the last non-zero element (which could be `list[0]` or `list[n-1]` depending on the initial conditions), which will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list becomes a series of zeros, with the exception that the last non-zero element (either `list[0]` or `list[n-1]`) will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value, and all other elements will be 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an element that is not zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function works correctly and serves its intended purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0` are met.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operations:
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - After performing the operations, it checks if `list[i-1]` is still not zero. If so, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - If the loop completes without printing 'NO', it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Logic of Operations**:
   - The operations performed in `func_2` do not always lead to the desired result of making all elements zero.
   - Specifically, the operations only reduce the values of the array but do not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero under the given constraints.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. The operations might not be able to reduce all elements to zero due to the specific values and their relationships.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the initial array cannot be reduced to all zeros using the given operations.
   - For instance, if the sum of the elements in the array is odd, it is impossible to make all elements zero because each operation reduces the sum by an even number (2 from `a_i` and 1 from both `a_{i-1}` and `a_{i+1}`).

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
