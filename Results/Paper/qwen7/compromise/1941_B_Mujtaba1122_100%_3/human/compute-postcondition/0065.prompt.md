You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array a, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 \* 10^5.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: The list becomes a series of zeros, with the exception that `list[n-1]` will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value, and all other elements will be 0. This is because the loop continuously modifies the elements as per the given conditions, eventually leaving only the first element (or the last one if we consider the reverse operation) with a negative value if it started with a non-zero value, and all others as zero.
    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- The loop starts by checking if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`.
    #- If these conditions are met, it performs the specified operations: subtracting `2 * list[i-1]` from `list[i]`, subtracting `list[i-1]` from `list[i+1]`, and subtracting `list[i-1]` from `list[i-1]`.
    #- These operations continue until either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1 or `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` is no longer greater than 0.
    #- After all iterations, the list will consist of zeros except for the last non-zero element (which could be `list[0]` or `list[n-1]` depending on the initial conditions), which will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list becomes a series of zeros, with the exception that the last non-zero element (either `list[0]` or `list[n-1]`) will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value, and all other elements will be 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers and an integer n. Since there are no return statements in the given code snippet, the function does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.

Case_2: The program does not return any value since there is no expression or variable being returned in the code snippet.

Case_3: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
