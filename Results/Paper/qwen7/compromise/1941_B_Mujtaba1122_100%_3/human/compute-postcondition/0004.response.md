Output State: **`i` is 1; `list[0]` must be greater than 0; `list[1]` is decreased by `list[0]`; `list[2]` must be greater than 0; `list[i-1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` simplifies to `list[i - 1] -= list[i - 1]`, which means `list[i - 1]` is subtracted by itself, resulting in `list[i - 1]` becoming 0. Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0, so `list[0]` becomes 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
