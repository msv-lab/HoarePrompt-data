Output State: **`i` is 1; `list[0]` is -4; `list[1]` is 0; `list[2]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is `list[2] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` updates the element at index `i - 1` in the list by subtracting `1 * list[i - 1]` from it. Given that `i` is 1, the index `i - 1` is 0. So, `list[0]` is updated to `-3 - 1 * -3`, which results in `-4`. The other variables remain unchanged.
