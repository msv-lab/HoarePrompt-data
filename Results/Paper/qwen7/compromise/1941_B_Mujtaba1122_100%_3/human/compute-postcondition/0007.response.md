Output State: **`i` is 1; `list[0]` must be greater than 0; `list[1]` is 0; `list[2]` must be greater than 0; `list[3]` is `list[2] - 1`; `list[1]` is decreased by 2 times `list[0]`**

Explanation: The code updates `list[i]` by subtracting `2 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `list[i]` refers to `list[1]`, and `list[i - 1]` refers to `list[0]`. So, `list[1]` is decreased by `2 * list[0]`. Since `list[0]` must be greater than 0, `list[1]` will now be a value less than its original value (specifically, `list[1]` will be `0 - 2 * list[0]`).
