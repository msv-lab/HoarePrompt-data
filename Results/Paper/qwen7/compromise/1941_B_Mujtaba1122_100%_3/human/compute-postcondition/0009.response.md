Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given as:
   ```
   while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
   ```

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `list[0]` is greater than 0.
   - `list[1]` is -2 * `list[0]`.
   - `list[2]` is greater than 0.
   - `list[3]` is `list[2] - 1`.
   - `list[1]` is decreased by 2 times `list[0]` and `list[0]` is decreased by 1 times itself.

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - For `i = 1`, the condition checks:
     - `list[1] > 1`: Since `list[1]` is -2 * `list[0]` and `list[0]` is greater than 0, `list[1]` is always negative and thus never greater than 1.
     - `list[0] > 0`: This is true based on the current state.
     - `list[2] > 0`: This is true based on the current state.

   Since `list[1] > 1` is false, the loop will not execute again based on the current values.

4. **Adjust the States to Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to change the state such that the loop condition becomes true. Specifically, we need to make `list[1] > 1`.

   - We know `list[1] = -2 * list[0]`.
   - To make `list[1] > 1`, we need `-2 * list[0] > 1`, which simplifies to `list[0] < -0.5`.

   Therefore, we need to adjust `list[0]` to be less than -0.5.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1; `list[0]` must be less than -0.5; `list[1]` is -2 * `list[0]`; `list[2]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is `list[2] - 1`; `list[1]` is decreased by 2 times `list[0]` and `list[0]` is decreased by 1 times itself.**
