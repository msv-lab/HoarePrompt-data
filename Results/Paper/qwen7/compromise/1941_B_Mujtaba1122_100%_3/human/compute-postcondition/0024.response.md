Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `list[i]` is now `list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`
   - `list[i - 1]` is 0
   - `list[i + 1]` is now `list[i + 1] - list[i - 1]`

3. **Analyze each part of the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `list[i] > 1` must be true.
   - For the loop to continue, `list[i - 1] > 0` must be true. However, from the current state, we know `list[i - 1]` is 0, so this condition cannot be met.
   - For the loop to continue, `list[i + 1] > 0` must be true.

Since `list[i - 1]` is 0, the condition `list[i - 1] > 0` cannot be satisfied. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `list[i - 1]` to ensure it is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to change `list[i - 1]` to a value greater than 0.

Given the conditions, the only state that needs adjustment is `list[i - 1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`list[i]` is now `list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i - 1]` is greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` is now `list[i + 1] - list[i - 1]`**
