Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\), and calculates a result based on specific conditions. It then prints the results for all test cases, one per line. If \(y\) is even, it calculates half of \(y\); if odd, it calculates half of \(y\) plus one. It also considers the space requirements for \(x\) and adjusts the result accordingly. The final output is a list of integers, each representing the calculated result for a given test case.**
