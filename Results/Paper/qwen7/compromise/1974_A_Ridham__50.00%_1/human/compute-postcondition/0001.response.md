Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `result` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `result`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of `t` and `n` while adding the new information about `result`.
