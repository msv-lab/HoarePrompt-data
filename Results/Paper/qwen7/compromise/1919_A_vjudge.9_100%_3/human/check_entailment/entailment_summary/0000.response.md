Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner based on the optimal strategy of both players.
2. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner. Specifically, the condition `if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:` is incorrect for this problem.
3. According to the game rules, the key factor in determining the winner is whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd or even. If the sum is even, Alice wins; if the sum is odd, Bob wins. This is because the game involves removing one coin per turn, and the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins determines the winner when both players play optimally.
4. The provided code checks the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`, which does not align with the actual winning condition.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
