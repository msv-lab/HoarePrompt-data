You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: `t`, `a`, and `b`. It reads these integers from standard input, where `t` specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, the function compares the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. If the difference is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice". After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no explicit return value but outputs a series of "Bob" or "Alice" based on the conditions specified.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them, but after choosing, they must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If `a` and `b` are equal, the player whose turn it is will lose because they will always end up swapping back to the same state, and eventually, they will be forced to swap when one of their wallets is empty.
   - If `a` and `b` are not equal, the player whose turn it is can always force the opponent into a losing position by ensuring that the difference between `a` and `b` remains odd. This is because the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference changes with each move, and the player can always make the difference odd again after the opponent's move.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even using `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob". Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies the winning condition based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`.
   - If the difference is even, it means `a` and `b` are equal or differ by an even number, which means the player whose turn it is will eventually lose if both play optimally.
   - If the difference is odd, the player whose turn it is can always force the opponent into a losing position.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy.
