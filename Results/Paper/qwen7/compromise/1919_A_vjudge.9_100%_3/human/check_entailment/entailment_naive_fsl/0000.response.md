Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. According to the problem description, the player who ends up with an even difference (in absolute terms) after all moves will lose because they will eventually run out of coins and be unable to make a valid move. However, the program incorrectly checks if the absolute difference is even and prints "Bob" if it is, which is the opposite of what should happen.

For example, consider the test case `1 1`:
- Initially, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\).
- The absolute difference is \(|1 - 1| = 0\), which is even.
- According to the problem, the player with the even difference (Alice) should lose, so the correct output should be "Alice".

However, the program outputs "Bob", which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not handle this case correctly and is thus incorrect.
