Output State: **ans is [1, 2, 4, 8].**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = lk - 2`. Given that `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, if we assume `k` is `3` (binary `11`), then `lk` would be `2`. The loop will run for `2` iterations (from `i = 0` to `i = 1`). Therefore, `ans` will contain `[2**0, 2**1]`, which is `[1, 2]`. However, since the loop runs until `lk - 1`, if `lk` is `3` (binary `111` for example), it would run for `2` iterations, resulting in `ans` being `[1, 2, 4]`. For a general case where `lk` is `n`, `ans` will be `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(n-1)]`. Assuming `lk` is `4` (binary `100`), `ans` will be `[1, 2, 4, 8]`.
