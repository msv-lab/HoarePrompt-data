Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is [2, 3], `n` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the list `[2, 3]` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `b`, `k`, `l`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
