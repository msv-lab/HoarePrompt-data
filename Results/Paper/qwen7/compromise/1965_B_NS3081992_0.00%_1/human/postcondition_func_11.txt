The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the maximum key in `d.keys() + 1`, an integer `da` which is a key from the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of zeros with the same length as the maximum key in `d.keys()`. It updates the `processing` list to mark nodes as processed and recursively calculates the minimum value of `func_12` for each node in `d[da]` where `processing` is not yet set. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it updates the `rank` list with `tmp + 1` and returns this value. The function can return either 1 or update the `rank` list to `tmp + 1` based on the conditions met during its execution.
