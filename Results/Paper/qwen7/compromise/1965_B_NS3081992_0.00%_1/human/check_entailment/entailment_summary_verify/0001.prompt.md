You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 15 : The function `func_15` outputs a series of integers, each representing the size of a sequence for a specific test case. The number of integers outputted is determined by the return value of `func_10`, which indicates the number of test cases. After executing, the function does not return any value but prints the sequence sizes for all test cases to the standard output.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a sequence \(a\) of length at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence sums to \(k\).
     - All integers from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\) must have a subsequence in \(a\) that sums to them.

2. **Reviewing the Functions:**
   - Most of the functions defined (1 through 14) are either utility functions or not used in the main logic.
   - Function `func_14` is the one that seems relevant to solving the problem.

3. **Analyzing `func_14`:**
   - It takes two integers \(n\) and \(k\) as input.
   - It converts \(n\) and \(k\) to binary representations.
   - Depending on whether \(k\) is 1 or not, it constructs a sequence \(ans\).

4. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: \(k = 1\):**
     - If \(n = 2\), the sequence is `[2]`.
     - Otherwise, the sequence is `[2, 3, 2^i for i in range(2, l)]`, where \(l\) is the length of the binary representation of \(n\).
   - **Case 2: \(k > 1\):**
     - The sequence includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \(k\).
     - It also includes \(k - 1 - \text{sum of previous elements}\), \(k + 1\), and \(2k + 1\).
     - Finally, it includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \(n\).

5. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic ensures that no subsequence sums to \(k\).
   - It covers all integers from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\).

6. **Output Format:**
   - The function returns a string of space-separated integers representing the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_14` appears to correctly generate a sequence that satisfies the problem constraints. The sequence construction logic ensures that no subsequence sums to \(k\) and all required subsequences for integers from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\) are included.

Correctness: **True**
