Output State: **`i` is at least `mid + 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 (i.e., `rightZero` is now `rightZero + 1`).**

The code `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. Since `trightZero` was previously increased by 1, it is now increased by another 1, making it `rightZero + 1`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
