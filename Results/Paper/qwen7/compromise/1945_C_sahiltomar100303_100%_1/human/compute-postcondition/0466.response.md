Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is equal to 0.
- `right` equals `n`.
- `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `leftMove`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `t`, and other related conditions remain unchanged.
- `leftZero` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `trightOne` is less than or equal to `rightOne`.
- Both `tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` hold true.

The `print(right)` statement will print the value of the variable `right`, which is equal to `n`.

Output: **n**
