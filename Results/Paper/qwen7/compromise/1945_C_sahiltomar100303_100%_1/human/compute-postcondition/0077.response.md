Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is (leftZero + 1), `rightOne` is less than (n - left + 1) // 2.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially less than `(left + 1) // 2`, after decrementing by 1, it will still satisfy the condition of being less than `(left + 1) // 2`. The value of `left` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0. The value of `rightOne` must still be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`. The string `s` is not affected by this operation.
