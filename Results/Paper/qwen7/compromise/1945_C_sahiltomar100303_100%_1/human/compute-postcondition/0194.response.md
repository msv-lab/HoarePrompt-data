Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except `leftZero` and `leftOne`, which are equal to `2 * mid` if the corresponding bit ('0' or '1') appears `mid` times in the string `s`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., `i` goes from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`), the variable `i` will be the last index processed, which is `n // 2 - 1`. The values of `leftZero` and `leftOne` will be the sum of the occurrences of '0' and '1' up to the middle of the string, respectively. Since the loop runs `n // 2` times, if the string has an even length, both `leftZero` and `leftOne` will each be incremented `n // 2` times, resulting in `leftZero` and `leftOne` being equal to `2 * (n // 2)` or simply `n`. If the string has an odd length, the exact final value depends on whether the middle character is '0' or '1'. However, the problem does not specify the length of the string, so we assume the general case where the string length is even for simplicity, leading to `leftZero` and `leftOne` both being `n`.
