Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` equals `n`.
- `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop.
- `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop.
- `left` is 0.
- `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both 0.
- The absolute difference between \((n + 1) // 2\) and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between \((n + 1) // 2\) and `right`.

We need to determine the value of `left` when the `print(left)` statement is executed.

From the initial state, it is explicitly stated that `left` is 0. Therefore, the value of `left` will be printed as 0.

Output: **0**
