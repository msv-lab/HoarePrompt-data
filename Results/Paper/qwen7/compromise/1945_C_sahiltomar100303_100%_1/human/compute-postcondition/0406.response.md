To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `left > 0` and `(leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)`.

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **Condition 1:** `left > 0`
   - This condition checks if `left` is greater than 0. Since `left` is currently `left - 1` from the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `left` must still be greater than 0.

2. **Condition 2:** `(leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)`
   - This condition checks if either `leftZero` is less than \((left + 1) // 2\) or `rightOne` is less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\).
   - From the given information, `leftZero` is either less than \((left + 1) // 2 - 1\) or still less than \((left + 1) // 2\). This means `leftZero` is already less than \((left + 1) // 2\).
   - `rightOne` is less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\).

Given these points, for the loop to continue, both conditions must hold true. Since `leftZero` is already less than \((left + 1) // 2\), we only need to ensure that `left > 0` and `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `left` must be greater than 0.
- `rightOne` must be less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\).

State: **`left` is greater than 0, `rightOne` is less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\)**
