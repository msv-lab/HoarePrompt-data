Postcondition: **Output State: `left` will be 0, `rightZero` will remain unchanged, `rightOne` will remain unchanged, `leftZero` will be between 0 and the total number of '0's from `mid` to the end of the string `s`, inclusive, `leftOne` will be between 0 and the total number of '1's from `mid` to the end of the string `s`, inclusive, `leftMove` will remain unchanged, `right` will be equal to `n`, `trightZero` will be less than or equal to `rightZero`, `trightOne` will be less than or equal to `rightOne`, `t` will remain unchanged, `n` will remain unchanged, and both `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` and `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` will hold true. The condition `left == 0` is now true, and `right` is not equal to `n`.**
