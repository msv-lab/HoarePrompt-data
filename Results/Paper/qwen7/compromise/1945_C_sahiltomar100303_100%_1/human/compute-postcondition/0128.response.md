Postcondition: **`right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop, `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop, `left` is 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both 0, and the current value of `left` remains 0, and `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`**.
