Output State: **`t` is an input integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state as an input integer within the specified range.
