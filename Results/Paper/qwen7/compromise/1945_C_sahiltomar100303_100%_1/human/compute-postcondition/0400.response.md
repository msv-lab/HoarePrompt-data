Output State: **`left` is now `left - 2`, `leftZero` is now less than \((left + 1) // 2 - 1\), `rightOne` must be less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\), and `rightZero` is now `rightZero + 1`**.

This means that the value of `rightZero` has been incremented by 1. All other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
