Output State: `i` is equal to `mid`, `leftZero` and `leftOne` sum up to `mid`, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` also sum up to `mid`, and both `leftZero` and `leftOne` are non-negative integers.

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has executed all its iterations. Since the loop runs from `i` in `range(mid)`, the final value of `i` will be `mid - 1`. The counters `leftZero` and `leftOne` will each have accumulated counts based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered in the string `s` up to index `mid - 1`. The temporary counters `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` will also reflect the same counts but will stop increasing once `i` reaches `mid - 1`.
