Postcondition: `right` must be less than `n`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and then decreased by 1, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` still holds. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `trightOne` is decreased by 1, and `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` still holds.
