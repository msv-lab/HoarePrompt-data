Output State: **`left` is greater than 0; `leftZero` is now `(left + 1) // 2 - 1`; `rightOne` must be less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\); `rightZero` is increased by 1; the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The line `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
