Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` is 1, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - 1`, and `trightOne` is either decreased by 1 or remains the same.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block. If the condition `s[right] == '0'` is true, then `trightZero` is set to `trightZero - 1` and `trightOne` is unchanged. If the condition is false, then `trightZero` remains the same and `trightOne` is decreased by 1. All other variables (`left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `right`, `tleftZero`) retain their respective conditions as specified in the if and else parts.
