Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- Other variables like `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `right`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne` are not directly relevant to the `print(left)` statement.
- The conditions involving `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and the comparison with `left` and `right` do not affect the direct value of `left`.

Given this, the only value that is directly printed is the value of `left`, which is explicitly given as 0.

Output: **0**
