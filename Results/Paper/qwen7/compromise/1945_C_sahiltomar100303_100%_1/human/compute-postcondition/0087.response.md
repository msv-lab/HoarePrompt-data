Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is decremented by 1, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `leftZero` must still be less than `(left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The value of `leftOne` is decreased by 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
