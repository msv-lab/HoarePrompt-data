Output State: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is either 1 or 2, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `right` must be less than `n`, `trightZero` is decreased by 1, `trightOne` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The code `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions involving `trightZero` and `trightOne` still hold true as per the initial state.
