Output State: **After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`; `rightZero` will count the number of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`; `rightOne` will count the number of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`; `left` will be equal to `mid`; all other variables (`leftZero`, `leftOne`, `right`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `t`, and `n`) will remain unchanged from their initial or post-first-three-iterations states.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `i` will point to the last index of the string `s`. The variable `left` is updated to be equal to `mid`. The variable `rightZero` will count the number of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string, and `rightOne` will count the number of '1's in the same range. All other variables (`leftZero`, `leftOne`, `right`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `t`, and `n`) will retain their values from before the loop started or after the first three iterations.
