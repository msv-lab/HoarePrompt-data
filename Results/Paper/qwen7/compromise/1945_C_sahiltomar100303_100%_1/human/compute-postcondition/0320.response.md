Postcondition: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2` or greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - right`, and `trightOne` is equal to `trightOne - (n - right)`. Additionally, if `right == n`, then `tleftZero` is either less than or equal to `n // 2` or greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2` or the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is greater than the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2`.
