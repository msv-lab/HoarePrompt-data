Output State: `i` is equal to `mid`, `leftZero` plus `trightZero` equals the total number of zeros in the string `s`, `leftOne` plus `trightOne` equals the total number of ones in the string `s`, `tleftZero` equals the total number of zeros encountered up to the last iteration, `tleftOne` equals the total number of ones encountered up to the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `mid`, `leftZero` and `trightZero` together will count all zeros in the string `s`, `leftOne` and `trightOne` together will count all ones in the string `s`, `tleftZero` will be the cumulative count of zeros seen throughout the loop, and `tleftOne` will be the cumulative count of ones seen throughout the loop.
