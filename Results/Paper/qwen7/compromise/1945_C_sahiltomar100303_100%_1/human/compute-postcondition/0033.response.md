Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 2, `leftZero` or `leftOne` is 4, `tleftOne` is 2, `leftOne` is 5**

The code `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. Given that `leftOne` was initially 4, after executing this line, `leftOne` becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
