Output State: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `right` is `mid` + 1, `trightZero` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `trightOne` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Since `right` was initially equal to `mid`, after executing the code, `right` becomes `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
