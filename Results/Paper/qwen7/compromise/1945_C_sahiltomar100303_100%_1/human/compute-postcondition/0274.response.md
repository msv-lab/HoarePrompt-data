Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` is less than `n`, `tleftZero` is less than `(right + 2) // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - 1`, `tleftOne` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Since `tleftOne` was initially unspecified but implied to start at 0 (as it's being incremented), its new value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
