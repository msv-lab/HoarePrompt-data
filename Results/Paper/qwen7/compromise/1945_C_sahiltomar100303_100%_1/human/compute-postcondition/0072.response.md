Output State: **`s` is a string, `left` is an integer such that the character at position `left - 1` in `s` is not '0', `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The values of `s`, `left`, and `leftOne` remain unchanged from their initial states.
