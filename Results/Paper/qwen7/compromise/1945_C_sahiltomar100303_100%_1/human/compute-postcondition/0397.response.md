Output State: **`left` is now `left - 1`, `leftZero` is adjusted based on whether `s[left - 1]` is '0' or not, and `rightOne` and `rightZero` are updated accordingly. If `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftZero` becomes `(left + 1) // 2 - 1`, and `rightZero` is increased by 1. If `s[left - 1]` is not '0', `leftZero` remains less than \((left + 1) // 2\), `rightOne` is increased by 1, and `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. All other conditions and relationships remain the same as they were before the decrement. The new value of `left` is `left - 1`. The adjustments to `leftZero`, `rightOne`, and `rightZero` depend on the value of `s[left - 1]`, which was `s[left]` before the decrement.
