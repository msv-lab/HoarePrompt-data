Postcondition: `s` is a string, `left` is decremented by 1, if `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is decremented by 1 and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - (left + 1)) // 2`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 and `leftZero` must still be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is increased by 1.
