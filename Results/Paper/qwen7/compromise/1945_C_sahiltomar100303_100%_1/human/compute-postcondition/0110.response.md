Output State: **`right` is less than `n - 1`, `tleftZero` < (right + 1) // 2 or `trightOne` < (n - right + 1) // 2 still holds, `trightOne` is decreased by 1**

Explanation: The variable `trightOne` is decreased by 1. The conditions involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` are still valid as per the initial state. The value of `right` and `n` remain unchanged.
