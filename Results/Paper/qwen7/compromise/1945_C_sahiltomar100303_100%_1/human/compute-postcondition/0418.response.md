Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `leftMove` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid`, `trightZero` remains unchanged, `trightOne` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `s[right]` is '0', and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**
