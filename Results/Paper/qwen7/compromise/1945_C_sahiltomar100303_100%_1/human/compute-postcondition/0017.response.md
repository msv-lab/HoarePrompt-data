Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is 2, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` (assuming it was meant to be `leftZero`) is incremented by 1. Initially, `leftZero` is 1, so after executing `leftZero += 1`, `leftZero` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
