Output State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

The variable `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `i` is still `mid + 1`, `n` must still be greater than `mid + 1`, and `rightOne` has been increased by 1.
