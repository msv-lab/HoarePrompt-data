Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases through input, where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each `t`, two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `a` and `b`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a count `t` and pairs of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation on `a` and `b` and returns the results accordingly.
