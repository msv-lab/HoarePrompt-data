Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from a given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- The provided solution checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints 'No', indicating that no other rectangle can be formed.
- This logic is correct because:
  - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle along the even dimension into two smaller rectangles, and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
  - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the only way to cut the rectangle would result in two \(1 \times 1\) squares, which cannot be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
- The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the provided function, confirming that it correctly implements the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
