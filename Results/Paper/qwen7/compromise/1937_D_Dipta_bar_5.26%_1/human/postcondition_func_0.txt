The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It calculates and prints a series of values based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters in the string. Specifically, it computes and outputs a sequence of integers derived from the positions of these characters, following a complex algorithm involving prefix and suffix sums. The output reflects the relative positions and counts of '>' and '<' characters in the string, providing a detailed analysis of their distribution.
