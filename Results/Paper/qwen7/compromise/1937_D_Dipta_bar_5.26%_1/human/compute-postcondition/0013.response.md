Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0.
   - The variable `n` is the length of the list `B`, which is given as `r`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Given that `n` is the length of `B` (i.e., `r`), the loop will continue as long as `i < r`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, it needs to be adjusted to 0.
   - `n` (which is `r`) must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 0 and `r` (which is `n`) to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `r` must be greater than 0**
