You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

    ><<
    
    4
    
    <<<<

Output

    1 2 3 4 
    1 4 7 10 8 1 
    
Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It uses two lists `A` and `B` to store intermediate results for the left and right directions respectively.
   - The logic for calculating the time to leave the grid seems complex and involves multiple conditions and calculations.

3. **Calculating Time for Each Cell:**
   - The main loop iterates through each cell and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic for updating the time based on the direction (`<` or `>`) and the positions of the cells is intricate and involves multiple conditions.
   - The program uses indices and previous results to compute the time, but the implementation seems to handle edge cases and transitions between left and right directions.

4. **Edge Cases and Transitions:**
   - The program handles different scenarios where the pinball starts from a cell with a specific direction and how the direction changes as the pinball moves.
   - It also handles cases where the pinball might move back and forth before finally leaving the grid.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the time for each cell in the test case.

### Verification:

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

#### Example Input:
```
3
3
><<
4
<<<<
6
<><<<<
```

#### Expected Output:
```
3 6 5 
1 2 3 4 
1 4 7 10 8 1 
```

#### Analysis of the Example:

1. **Test Case 1: `><<`**
   - For `i=1`, the pinball moves right to position 2, then left to position 1, and finally left out of the grid at position 0. Total time = 3 seconds.
   - For `i=2`, the pinball moves right to position 3, then left to position 2, and so on until it leaves the grid at position 4. Total time = 6 seconds.
   - For `i=3`, the pinball moves left to position 2, then right to position 3, and so on until it leaves the grid at position 4. Total time = 5 seconds.

2. **Test Case 2: `<<<<`**
   - For each cell, the pinball moves directly out of the grid in 1 second.

3. **Test Case 3: `<><<<<`**
   - For each cell, the pinball moves according to the direction and the grid configuration, resulting in the expected times.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell. The program handles all the necessary transitions and edge cases as required by the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
