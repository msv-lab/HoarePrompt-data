The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of balanced seating arrangements possible. If a test case cannot achieve a balanced arrangement under certain conditions, it prints -1 instead. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
