State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer because `range(n)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
3. The variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins, as `range(n)` generates values starting from 0 up to `n-1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.
- `i` must be 0, as this is the initial value for the loop.

The final state is: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.
