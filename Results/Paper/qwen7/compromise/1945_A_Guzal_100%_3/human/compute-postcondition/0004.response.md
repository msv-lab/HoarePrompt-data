Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, the function determines the possible number of balanced seating arrangements and returns the result.**

Note: The actual processing logic and the way the function determines the possible number of balanced seating arrangements is not described here, only the input and output characteristics.
