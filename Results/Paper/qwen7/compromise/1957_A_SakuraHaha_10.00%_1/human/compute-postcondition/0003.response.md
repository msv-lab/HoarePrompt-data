Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = dict()` creates an empty dictionary named `cnt`. This dictionary does not affect the values of `ans`, `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
