Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, splits the line into individual strings, converts those strings back to integers, and stores them in a list called `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
