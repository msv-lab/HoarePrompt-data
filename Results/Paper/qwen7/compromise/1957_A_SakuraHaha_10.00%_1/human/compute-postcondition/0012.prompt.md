You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the sum of the counts of each integer in `a` divided by 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the counts of each integer in list `a` divided by 4)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). For each set, it processes the integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and returns a result based on these integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
