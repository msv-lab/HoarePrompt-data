Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `idx` is 24.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `n` is an integer input from `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `k` must be at least \(2^{25}\).
   - `nums` initially contains integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`.
   - An additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]` is added to `nums`.
   - The element \(2^{24}\) is removed from `nums`.
   - An additional element `k - nums[24]` is added to `nums`.
   - An additional element `k + 1` is added to `nums`.
   - An additional element `k + nums[idx] + 1` which is `k + 25` is added to `nums`.

2. **Elements in `nums`:**
   - Initially, `nums` contains integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).
   - After removing \(2^{24}\), `nums` no longer contains \(2^{24}\).
   - Adding `k + 1 + nums[23]` means adding \(k + 1 + (k - 2^{23}) = 2k - 2^{23} + 1\).
   - Adding `k - nums[24]` means adding \(k - 2^{24}\).
   - Adding `k + 1` is straightforward.
   - Adding `k + 25` is straightforward.

3. **Counting Elements in `nums`:**
   - Initially, there were 24 elements (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)).
   - Removing \(2^{24}\) reduces the count by 1.
   - Adding 4 more elements increases the count by 4.
   - Therefore, the total number of elements in `nums` is \(24 - 1 + 4 = 27\).

Output: **27**
