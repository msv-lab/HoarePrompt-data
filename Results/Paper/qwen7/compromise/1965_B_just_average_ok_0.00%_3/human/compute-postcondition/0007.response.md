Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 1, so after executing the code, `idx` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
