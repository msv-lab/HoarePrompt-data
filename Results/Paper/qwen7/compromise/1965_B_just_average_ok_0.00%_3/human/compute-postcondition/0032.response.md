Output State: **`idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` must be at least \(2^{25}\), `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`, and `nums` now contains an additional element `k - nums[24]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 24, `nums[idx]` is `nums[24]`, which is `k - 2^{23}`. Therefore, the new element added to `nums` is `k - (k - 2^{23})`, which simplifies to `2^{23}`. However, since `1 \ll 23` (which is \(2^{23}\)) was already removed from `nums`, the new element added is simply `k - nums[24]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
