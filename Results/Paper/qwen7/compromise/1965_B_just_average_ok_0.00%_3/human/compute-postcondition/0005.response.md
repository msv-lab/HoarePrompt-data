Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` is the second integer input split from the same line of input, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23**.

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
