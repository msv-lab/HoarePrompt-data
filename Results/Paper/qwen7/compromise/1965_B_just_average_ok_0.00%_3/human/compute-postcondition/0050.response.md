Output State: **`idx` is 3, `k` must be at least 8.**

Explanation: Initially, `idx` is 4 and `k` must be at least 8. The code `idx -= 1` decrements `idx` by 1. Therefore, `idx` becomes 3. The condition for the loop to continue is `k >= 1 << idx`. After the decrement, the loop would continue as long as `k` is at least 8 because `1 << 3` is 8. Since `k` must still be at least 8 for the loop to have executed, the value of `k` remains unchanged. Thus, the output state is `idx` is 3 and `k` must be at least 8.
