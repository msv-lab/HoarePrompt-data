Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` is the second integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with \(nums[23]\) being \(k - 2^{23}\) and an additional element \(k + 1 + nums[23]\), and the element \(1 \ll idx\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The initial values of `idx`, `t`, and the list `nums` remain unchanged except for the fact that the element \(2^{23}\) has been removed from `nums`. The value of `n` is the first integer entered, and `k` is the second integer entered.
