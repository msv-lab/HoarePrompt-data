Step-by-step reasoning:

1. `idx` is explicitly given as 3.
2. `k` must be at least 8, but it is not specified exactly what value `k` takes.
3. `nums` does not contain the element 1 << 3 (which is 8).
4. The last element of `nums` is `k + 4`.

Given these conditions, let's determine what will be printed:

- Since `k` must be at least 8, the smallest possible value for `k` is 8. However, since `nums` does not contain 8, `k` cannot be 8. Therefore, `k` must be greater than 8.
- The last element of `nums` is `k + 4`. Since `k` is at least 9 (the smallest possible value for `k` that satisfies the conditions), the last element of `nums` is at least 13.

Since `nums` does not contain 8, and the last element is `k + 4`, we can conclude that `nums` contains elements other than 8, and the last element is specifically `k + 4`.

The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements of the list `nums` separated by spaces. However, without knowing the exact elements of `nums` except for the last one, we can only say that the last element is `k + 4`.

Output: **[elements of nums excluding 8, followed by k + 4]**
