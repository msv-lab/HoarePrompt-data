Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23 with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^23`, and `nums` now contains an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `nums` the value `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Given that `idx` is 23 and `nums[23]` is `k - 2^23`, the new element added to `nums` is `k + (k - 2^23) + 1`, which simplifies to `2*k - 2^23 + 1`. Therefore, `nums` now includes this new value.
