Let's break down the initial state and the list `nums` step by step:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `idx` is 24.
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `k` must be at least \(2^{25}\).
   - `nums` initially contains integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being \(k - 2^{23}\).

2. **Modifications to `nums`**:
   - An additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]` is added to `nums`.
   - The element \(2^{24}\) is removed from `nums`.
   - An additional element `k - nums[24]` is added to `nums`.
   - The element `k + 1` is added to `nums`.
   - The element `k + 25` (which is `k + nums[idx] + 1`) is added to `nums`.

Given these steps, let's construct the final list `nums`:

- Initially, `nums` contains the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), so it looks like this: `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{23}]`.
- The element `nums[23]` is \(k - 2^{23}\).
- After adding `k + 1 + nums[23]`, the list becomes: `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{23}, k - 2^{23}, k + 1 + (k - 2^{23})] = [1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{23}, k - 2^{23}, 2k - 2^{23} + 1]`.
- Removing \(2^{24}\) gives us: `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{23}, k - 2^{23}, 2k - 2^{23} + 1]`.
- Adding `k - nums[24]` means adding `k - (k - 2^{23}) = 2^{23}`: `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{23}, 2^{23}, 2k - 2^{23} + 1]`.
- Adding `k + 1` gives: `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{23}, 2^{23}, 2k - 2^{23} + 1, k + 1]`.
- Finally, adding `k + 25` (since `nums[idx]` is `2^{24}` and `2^{24}` was removed, `nums[idx]` is now `2^{23}`): `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{23}, 2^{23}, 2k - 2^{23} + 1, k + 1, k + 25]`.

So, the final list `nums` is:
\[ [1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{23}, 2^{23}, 2k - 2^{23} + 1, k + 1, k + 25] \]

Therefore, the output of the `print(*nums)` statement will be:
Output: **1 2 4 ... 8388608 8388608 2k - 8388608 + 1 k + 1 k + 25**
