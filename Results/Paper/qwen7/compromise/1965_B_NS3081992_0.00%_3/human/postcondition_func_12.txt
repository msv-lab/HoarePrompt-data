The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers with `b` being greater than 0 and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` being 1. Depending on the value of `b`, it either directly returns `x` as 1, `y` as 0, and `a` unchanged (with `b` becoming 0), or it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` to compute `x`, `y`, and `g`. Finally, it returns `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`. In both cases, the function ensures that the gcd of `a` and `b` remains 1.
