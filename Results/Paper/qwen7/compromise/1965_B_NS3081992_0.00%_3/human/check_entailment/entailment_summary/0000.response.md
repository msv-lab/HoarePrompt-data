Reasoning:
- The problem requires generating a sequence of non-negative integers that meets specific criteria regarding sums of subsequences.
- The function `func_14()` is designed to solve the problem directly.
- Let's analyze `func_14()` to ensure it meets the problem requirements:
  - It takes the inputs `n` and `k` from the user using `func_7()`.
  - It constructs a sequence based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`.
  - If `k` is 1, it returns a simple sequence `[1, 2]`.
  - Otherwise, it builds a sequence that avoids sums equal to `k` and includes all other sums from 1 to `n`.

Let's break down the logic of `func_14()`:

1. **Case when `k` is 1:**
   - If `n` is 2, it returns "1\n2".
   - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence `[2, 3, 2^i for i in range(2, l)]` where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.

2. **Case when `k` is not 1:**
   - It constructs a sequence that avoids sums equal to `k` and includes all other sums from 1 to `n`.
   - It includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - It ensures that the sum `k` is not achievable by carefully choosing the last few elements of the sequence.

Given the problem constraints and the construction of the sequence in `func_14()`, it appears that the function correctly generates a sequence that meets the required conditions. The sequence avoids sums equal to `k` and includes all other sums from 1 to `n`.

Since `func_15()` simply iterates over the test cases and prints the result of `func_14()` for each test case, it also contributes to the correctness of the program.

Therefore, the overall program is correct based on the given problem description and the behavior of the functions.

Correctness: **True**
