Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - No subsequence of `a` should have a sum equal to `k`.
   - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there must be a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program includes various helper functions, but the main logic is encapsulated in `func_14` and `func_15`.

3. **Function `func_14`:**
   - This function takes `n` and `k` as inputs.
   - It converts `n` and `k` to binary representations.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the sequence `ans` based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`.

4. **Special Case Handling (`k == 1`):**
   - If `k == 1`, the program checks if `n == 2`. If true, it returns `1\n2`.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 starting from `2^2` until the length of `b` (binary representation of `n`).

5. **General Case Handling:**
   - If `k != 1`, it converts `k` to its binary representation.
   - It initializes `ans` with powers of 2 up to the length of `bk` (binary representation of `k`).
   - It calculates the remaining value needed to cover all sums from 1 to `n` excluding `k`.
   - It appends additional values to ensure all sums from 1 to `n` are covered except `k`.

6. **Output Construction:**
   - The function constructs the final sequence `ans` and returns it as a space-separated string.

7. **Main Function `func_15`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_14` and writes the result to standard output.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Special Case (`k == 1`):**
  - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the output `1\n2` is correct because the only possible subsequence sum is 1, which is not allowed.

- **Correctness of General Case:**
  - The constructed sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while covering all other sums from 1 to `n`.
  - The approach using binary representation and powers of 2 ensures that all required sums are covered.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence `a` that meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
