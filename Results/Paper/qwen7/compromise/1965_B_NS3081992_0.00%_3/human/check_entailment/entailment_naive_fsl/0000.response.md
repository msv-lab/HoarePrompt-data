Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a sequence `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_14()` does not ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum of `k`, which is a critical requirement.

For example, consider the test case `n = 8` and `k = 8`. The function `func_14()` generates the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 15]`. This sequence does not meet the requirement because it includes a subsequence with a sum of `8` (e.g., `[8]`). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
