Postcondition: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`. If `k` is 1, then `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8]. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk), 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^l], where `lk` is the length of `bk`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**
