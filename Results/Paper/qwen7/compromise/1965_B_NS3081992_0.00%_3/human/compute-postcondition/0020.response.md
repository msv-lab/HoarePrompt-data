Output State: **`lk` is the length of `bk`, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `bk`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)], and `ans` is updated to include `k - 1 - sum(ans)`**.

This means that the list `ans` has been appended with the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`. All other variables retain their previous values.
