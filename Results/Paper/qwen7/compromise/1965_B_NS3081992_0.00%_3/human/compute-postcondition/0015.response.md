Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `bk`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `k` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the integer `k` into its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. This means `bk` now holds the binary representation of `k`. The other variables (`b`, `k`, and `l`) retain their previous conditions, with `l` being updated to the length of `bk`.
