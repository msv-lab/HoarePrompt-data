Output State: `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`.

Explanation: The loop starts with `i` set to 2 and runs until `i` is less than `l` (the length of the binary representation of `n`). For each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to `ans`. Since the loop starts at `i = 2` and increments `i` by the default value of 1, it will append `2 ** 2`, `2 ** 3`, and so on, up to `2 ** (l-1)`. Given the initial `ans` is `[2, 3]`, after the loop, `ans` will be extended to `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. The values of `b`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
