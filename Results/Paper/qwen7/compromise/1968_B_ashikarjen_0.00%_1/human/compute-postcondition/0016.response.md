Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and `k` is increased by 1; for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is incremented by 1, while the other variables (`j`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
