Output State: **`j` is less than `m` and `b[j]` is not equal to `a[i]`; `j` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was initially less than `m` and `b[j]` was not equal to `a[i]`, after incrementing `j`, the condition `j < m` still holds true unless `j` reached `m`. Additionally, the condition `b[j] != a[i]` also remains valid unless `b[j]` became equal to `a[i]` after the increment. However, without further information, we can only definitively say that `j` has been increased by 1.
