Output State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and `j` is less than `m`; `k` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `k` has been incremented by 1, while all other conditions and values remain unchanged.
