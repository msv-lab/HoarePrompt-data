Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is equal to `m`
   - `m` is greater than 0
   - For every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop variable `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `n`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` remains unchanged and still equals `m`.
   - `m` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.
   - The condition for `b[i]` and `a[i]` remains the same for all `i` in the range `[0, m-1]`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `j` is equal to `m`
   - `m` is greater than 0
   - For every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`
   - `i` will be `n` for the next iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is equal to `m`, `m` is greater than 0, and for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and `i` is `n`**
