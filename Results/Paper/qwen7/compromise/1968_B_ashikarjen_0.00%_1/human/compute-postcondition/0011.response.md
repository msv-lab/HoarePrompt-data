Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Determine which variables are in the loop head**: The variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`.
3. **Check the current state**:
   - `j` is 3.
   - `m` is greater than 2.
   - `b[2]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be satisfied:
- `j < m` must be true.
- `b[j] != a[i]` must be true.

Given that `j` is currently 3, for the first condition `j < m` to be true, `m` must be greater than 3. For the second condition `b[j] != a[i]` to be true, `b[3]` (since `j` is 3) must not be equal to `a[i]`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the states of `j` and `m` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

**State:**
- `j` must be 3 (it is already 3).
- `m` must be greater than 3.
- `b[3]` must not be equal to `a[i]`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`j` is 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `b[3]` must not be equal to `a[i]`**
