Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), followed by two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \) of lengths \( n \) and \( m \) respectively. It then counts the number of positions where the characters in \( a \) and \( b \) match and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function prints 0.**
