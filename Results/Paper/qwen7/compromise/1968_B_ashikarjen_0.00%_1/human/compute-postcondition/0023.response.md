Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j < m and b[j] != a[i]`.
2. **Analyze each part of the loop condition**:
   - `j < m`: This condition checks if `j` is less than `m`.
   - `b[j] != a[i]`: This condition checks if the element at index `j` in array `b` is not equal to the element at index `i` in array `a`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions must be true.
   - Initially, `j` is equal to `m`, which means `j == m`. This violates the condition `j < m`.
   - The condition `b[j] != a[i]` is already satisfied because `j` is equal to `m`, and since `m` is greater than 0, `b[m]` is a valid element (assuming arrays are zero-indexed).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` must be less than `m` for the loop to execute, we need to decrease `j` by 1 so that `j < m` is true.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `j` is one less than `m`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` is greater than 0, and for every index `i` where `i` ranges from `0` to `m-1`, `b[i]` must not be equal to `a[i]`, and `i` is `n`**
