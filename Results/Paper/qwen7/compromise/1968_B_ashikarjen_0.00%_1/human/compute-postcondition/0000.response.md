Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; n is assigned the value of the first space-separated integer input; m is assigned the value of the second space-separated integer input.**

In this state, the variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state. The variables `n` and `m` are now assigned the values of the first and second integers entered by the user, respectively.
