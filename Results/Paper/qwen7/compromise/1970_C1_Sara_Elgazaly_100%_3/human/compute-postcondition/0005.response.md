Output State: **`z` is an input integer, x and y are integers input from the user, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; lst is a defaultdict where all values are lists, representing an undirected graph with x-1 edges, where each edge connects two nodes specified by the input; rev is a defaultdict where all values are lists, representing the reverse adjacency list of the graph.**

The code assigns the value of the input to the variable `z`. All other variables retain their initial states.
