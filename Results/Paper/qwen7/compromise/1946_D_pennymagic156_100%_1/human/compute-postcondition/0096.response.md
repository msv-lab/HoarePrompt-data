Output State: **`t` is a list containing `[0, 0]`, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]`, `val` is `0`, `op` is `0 ^ 0 >> 28 & 1` which is `0`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `op` by performing the bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the result of `val >> i & 1`. Given that `val` is `0` and `i` is `28`, the expression `val >> i & 1` evaluates to `0`. Since `op` was initially `0`, the operation `op ^= 0` does not change the value of `op`, so `op` remains `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
