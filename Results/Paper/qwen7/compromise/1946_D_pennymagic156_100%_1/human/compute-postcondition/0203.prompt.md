Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(29, -1, -1):
    u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
    if u == v == 0:
        continue
    if u == 0:
        if v % 2:
            return ans
        else:
            op = ai = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                ai ^= val
                if not op:
                    t.append(ai)
                    ai = 0
            a, t = t, []
    elif v % 2:
        continue
    elif v:
        op = cnt = 0
        for val in a:
            op ^= val >> i & 1
            if not op:
                cnt += 1
        ans = max(ans, cnt)
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 29, `u` is not 0, and `v` is 0. If `u` is 0, then `ans` remains -1. Otherwise, `ans` is set to the final result of the XOR operation over all elements in `a` shifted right by `i` positions and masked with 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]`. If both `u` and `v` are 0, no changes are made. Otherwise, if `v` is odd, no changes are made. If `v` is even and non-zero, `ans` is set to the length of the list `a`. If `v` is 0, `ans` remains either -1 or 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 27, `u` is `(a[0] >> 27 & 1)`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]`. If `u` and `v` are both 0, no changes are made to the variables. If `v` is odd, `t` remains empty, `ans` remains either -1 or 0, `i` remains 27, `u` remains `(a[0] >> 27 & 1)`, and `v` remains the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]`. If `v` is even, `t` remains empty, `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and the count of times `op` becomes 0 during the loop, `i` remains 27, `u` remains `(a[0] >> 27 & 1)`, and `v` remains the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
