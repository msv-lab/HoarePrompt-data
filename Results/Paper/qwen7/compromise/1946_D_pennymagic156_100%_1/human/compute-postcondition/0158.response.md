Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, `ai` is the result of `ai ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and `t` is a list with one additional element `ai`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Since `ai` is already defined as `ai ^ (val >> i & 1)`, it does not change its value. The other variables (`a`, `val`, and `ai`) remain unchanged except that `t` now contains an extra element which is `ai`.
