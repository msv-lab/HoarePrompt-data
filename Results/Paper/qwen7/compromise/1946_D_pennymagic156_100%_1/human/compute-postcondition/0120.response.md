Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]` updated with the new value of `a[i] >> 27 & 1` and it is even and non-zero, `op` is 1, `cnt` is 2**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `op` and the result of `val >> i & 1`. Given that `i` is 28, the operation becomes `op ^= val >> 28 & 1`. Since `val` is not defined in the context, we consider the previous state where `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`. This means `op` is updated by `op ^= u`. Given that `op` was initially 0, after this operation, `op` becomes 1 (since 0 ^ 1 = 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
