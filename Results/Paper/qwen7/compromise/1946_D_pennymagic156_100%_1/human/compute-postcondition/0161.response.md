Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `val` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. Therefore, the loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a list with at least one element.
   - `val` is the next element in the list `a`.
   - `ai` is either 0 or the result of `ai ^ (val >> i & 1)`.
   - `t` is a list with one additional element `ai`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `val` is the next element in the list `a`, at the start of the next iteration, `val` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` will have one fewer element because the current `val` has been processed.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `a` must now be a list with at least one element minus the current `val` (which means it has one fewer element).
   - `val` will be the next element in the updated list `a`.
   - `ai` will be recalculated based on the new `val` but its exact value is not specified here, so we keep it as `ai`.
   - `t` will have one additional element `ai` from the previous iteration, so it will have two additional elements from the previous and current iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, `ai` is either 0 or the result of `ai ^ (val >> i & 1)`, and `t` is a list with two additional elements `ai`.**
