Output State: **`t` is a list containing ['ai ^ val_next'], `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is 0, `v` is 0, `op` is True, `ai` is 0, `val` is `val_next`**.

Explanation: The operation `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op`. Here, `val >> i & 1` shifts `val` right by `i` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with 1. Given that `i` is 29, `val >> 29` results in 0 because all bits of `val` are shifted out. Thus, `val >> 29 & 1` evaluates to 0. The XOR operation between `op` (which is initially False) and 0 results in `op` becoming True. All other variables remain unchanged.
