Output State: **`op` is False, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `val` is the next element in `a` after `val_next`, `t` is a list containing ['ai ^ val_next', 'ai ^ val_next', `ai`], `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is 0, `v` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Initially, `t` contains `['ai ^ val_next', 'ai ^ val_next']`. After appending `ai`, `t` becomes `['ai ^ val_next', 'ai ^ val_next', ai]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
