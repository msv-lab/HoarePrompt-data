Output State: **`t` is a list containing `[0, 0]`, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0 ^ 0 which is 0, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]`, `val` is 0**

Explanation: The line `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` (which is initially 0) and `val` (which is also 0). The result of 0 XOR 0 is 0. Therefore, `ai` remains unchanged at 0. All other variables retain their initial values or expressions.
