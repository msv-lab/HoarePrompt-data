Postcondition: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]` updated with the new value of `a[i] >> 27 & 1` and it is even and non-zero, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 3.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of the value of `op`, the final state of the variables remains as specified in the if part since the else part does not change the variables and the if condition evaluates to false (as `not op` when `op` is 1).
