Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `val` is undefined, `op` is the final result of the loop, `ai` is 0, `t` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `a, t = t, []` swaps the values of `a` and `t`. Initially, `a` is an empty list and `t` is a list containing all unique values of `ai` where `op` was `False` during the loop execution. After the swap, `a` becomes an empty list, and `t` becomes an empty list since it is reassigned to an empty list. The values of `val` and `op` remain unchanged.
