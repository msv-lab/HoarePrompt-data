Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]` updated with the new value of `a[28] >> 27 & 1` and it is even and non-zero, `op` is 1, `cnt` is 4, `val` is `a[28]`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)` which evaluates to 1 since `val >> i & 1` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` was 3, so after executing this line, `cnt` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
