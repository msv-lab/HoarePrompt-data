Output State: **`t` is [ai], `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `op` is 0, `ai` is `ai` XOR `val`, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]**.

Explanation: The code `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Since `t` was initially an empty list, after appending `ai`, `t` becomes `[ai]`. The values of `ans`, `i`, `op`, `ai`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
