The function processes a list of integers `a` and an integer `x` to find the maximum count of consecutive zeros in the binary representation of the elements in `a`. If certain conditions are met, it returns -1 or 0, otherwise, it returns the maximum value between -1 or 0 and the length of the list `a`.
