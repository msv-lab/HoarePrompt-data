Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `g` will be the product of all elements in the list `l` (each element divided by the greatest common divisor with `g`), `i` will be equal to `len(l)`, and `l` will be an empty list.

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `g` will hold the value obtained by multiplying all elements of the list `l` together, while dividing each multiplication step by the greatest common divisor of `g` and the current element. The variable `i` will have exceeded the length of the list `l`, indicating that all elements have been processed. Additionally, the list `l` itself will be empty since it gets modified in each iteration by updating its elements, eventually leading to an empty list.
