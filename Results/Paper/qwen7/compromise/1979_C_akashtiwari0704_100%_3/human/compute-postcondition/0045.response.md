Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]) * l[i] // gcd(g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0]), l[i])`, `i` is 2, `len(l)` must be greater than 1**.

Explanation: The initial state sets `g` to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`. The code then updates `g` to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, where `i` is initially 1. After this operation, `i` is incremented to 2 (assuming it's part of a loop or similar context where `i` is incremented). The value of `g` is now updated to the product of the initial update and the new update, and `i` is now 2. The condition that `len(l)` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
