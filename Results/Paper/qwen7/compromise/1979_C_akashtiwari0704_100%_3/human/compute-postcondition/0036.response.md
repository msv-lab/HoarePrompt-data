Output State: **`i` is 3, `bets` must be greater than 3, `ans` is equal to ' ' + str(a[1]) + ' ' + str(a[3]) + ' '**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is initially set to `' ' + str(a[1]) + ' '`. The code then appends `str(a[i]) + ' '` to `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, `str(a[i])` becomes `str(a[3])`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `' ' + str(a[1]) + ' ' + str(a[3]) + ' '`. The values of `i` and `bets` remain unchanged.
