Postcondition: **`sumo` is the original value plus the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 0, `T` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `bets`, and `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in list `a` after the updates. The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.**
