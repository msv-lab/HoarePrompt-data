Output State: `i` is equal to `2 * N`, `ans` is the concatenation of 'a[i] ' for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `bets` must be greater than or equal to `N`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to twice the number of iterations (`2 * N`). The variable `ans` will contain a string where each element `a[i]` for `i` ranging from 0 to `N-1` is appended with a space. The variable `bets` must still be greater than or equal to the number of iterations `N`.
