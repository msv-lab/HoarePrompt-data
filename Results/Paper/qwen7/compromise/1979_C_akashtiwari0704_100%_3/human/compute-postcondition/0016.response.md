Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `T` remains 0, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input(), `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in list `a`, `sumo` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sumo` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `bets`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `g`, `i`, `l`, `a`, and `prod` remain unchanged, and `sumo` is set to 0.
