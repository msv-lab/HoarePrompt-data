Functionality: **The function `lcm` takes a list of integers `l` as input and returns the product of all elements in the list after each element has been divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the current element and the accumulating product `g`. After processing all elements, the variable `i` is set to the length of the list `l`, indicating that all elements have been processed.**
