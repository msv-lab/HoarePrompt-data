Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < bets`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `ans` is 'a[0]'
   - `bets` must be greater than or equal to `N`

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, it will be incremented by 1 at the beginning of each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `bets` must still be greater than or equal to `N`.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `ans` remains 'a[0]' because the loop body is omitted and no changes are mentioned.
   - `bets` must still be greater than or equal to `N`.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `ans` is 'a[0]', `bets` must be greater than or equal to `N`**
