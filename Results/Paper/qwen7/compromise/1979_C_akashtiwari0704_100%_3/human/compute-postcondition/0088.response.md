Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is now i + 1, `l` is a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `g` to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`. It also increments `i` by 1. The precondition that `i` is less than the length of `l` remains valid, but `i` itself is updated to `i + 1`. The list `l` and its length remain unchanged.
