Output State: `i` is equal to `2 * N`, `ans` is the concatenation of 'a[i] ' for all `i` from 0 to `N-1`, `bets` must be greater than or equal to `N`.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to twice the number of iterations (`2 * N`). The string `ans` will contain the concatenation of 'a[i] ' for each index `i` from 0 to `N-1`. The variable `bets` must remain greater than or equal to the number of iterations `N`.
