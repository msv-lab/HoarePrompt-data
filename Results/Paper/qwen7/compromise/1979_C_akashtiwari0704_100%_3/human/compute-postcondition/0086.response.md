Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`, `i` is less than the length of `l`, `l` is a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `g` is updated to its current value multiplied by `l[i]` (where `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `l`) and then divided by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. The value of `i` remains less than the length of `l`, and `l` remains a non-empty list.
