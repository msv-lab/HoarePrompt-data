Output State: **`sumo` is the original value plus `int(a[i])` + `int(a[i])` + `int(a[i])`, `bets` must be greater than `i`, `T` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `g` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]`, and `prod` is the least common multiple of all integers in list `a`**.

Explanation: The variable `sumo` is incremented by `int(a[i])`. Since `int(a[i])` was originally added twice, the new value of `sumo` is the original value plus `int(a[i])` + `int(a[i])` + `int(a[i])`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
