Output State: **`i` is 2; `ans` is equal to `str(a[1]) + ' '`**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` increments the value of `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is currently 1) with a space. Since `i` was initially 1, after executing the line, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `ans` is updated to be the string `str(a[1]) + ' '`.
