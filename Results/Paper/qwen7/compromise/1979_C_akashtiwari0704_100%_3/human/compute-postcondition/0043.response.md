Output State: **`g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The variable `g` is updated by multiplying its current value by `l[i]` (which is `l[0]` since `i` is 0) and then performing integer division by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `g` and `l[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The length of the list `l` must still be greater than 0.
