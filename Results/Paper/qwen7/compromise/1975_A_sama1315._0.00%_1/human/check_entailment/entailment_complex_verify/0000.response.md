### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The function `func_1` should check if the array can be rearranged in this manner.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` currently checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`. If this condition is true, it returns 'Yes'.
- If the array is not sorted, it uses `any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))` to check if there is at least one pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element. If such a pair exists, it returns 'No'; otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

This approach is flawed because it only checks if the array is already sorted, not if it can be sorted by the specified operation.

#### Example Counterexample:
Consider the array `[1, 3, 2]`:
- The array is not sorted, so `func_1` would return 'No'.
- However, we can split the array into `[1]` and `[3, 2]`, swap them to get `[3, 2, 1]`, and then split `[3, 2]` into `[3]` and `[2]`, swap them to get `[2, 3, 1]`, and finally split `[2, 3]` into `[2]` and `[3]`, swap them to get `[3, 2, 1]`, which can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 3]`.

Thus, the function `func_1` incorrectly returns 'No' for this case.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.
- The state transitions and logic in `func_2` are correct for reading and processing the input.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the array can be split and swapped in such a way that it becomes non-decreasing. This involves checking if the array can be split into two parts where the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing, and the maximum element of the first part is less than or equal to the minimum element of the second part.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be rearranged through the specified operation.

**Final: False**
