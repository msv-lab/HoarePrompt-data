### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's reiterate why the program is incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. It does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by splitting and swapping.
   - For example, the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]` is not sorted, but it can be sorted by splitting it into `[3, 1]` and `[4, 1, 5]`, and then swapping them to get `[4, 1, 5, 3, 1]`. Since `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, it would incorrectly return 'No' for this case.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads input and processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, since `func_1` does not correctly identify if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping, the overall program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation because `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted.

**Final: False**
