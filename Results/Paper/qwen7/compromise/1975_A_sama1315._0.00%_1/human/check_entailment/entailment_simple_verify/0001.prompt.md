You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1` Analysis
1. **Function Purpose**: This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. **Logic**:
   - If the array is already sorted (`all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`), it returns 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there is at least one pair where the current element is greater than the next element (`any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`). If such a pair exists, it returns 'No'.
   - If no such pair exists, it implicitly returns 'Yes'.

This logic correctly identifies if the array is already sorted. However, it does not handle the possibility of sorting the array through the specified operation (splitting and swapping).

#### Function `func_2` Analysis
1. **Function Purpose**: This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
2. **Logic**:
   - It reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - It splits the input into individual components.
   - For each test case, it extracts the necessary information (number of elements and the array).
   - It calls `func_1` with the array and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

This part of the code is correct and handles the input and output as required.

### Correctness Check
To determine if the overall program is correct, we need to verify if `func_1` correctly identifies whether the array can be sorted using the specified operation.

#### Issue with `func_1`
The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted. It does not account for the possibility of sorting the array by splitting and swapping. For example, consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. Although this array is not sorted, it can be sorted by splitting it into `[3, 1]` and `[4, 1, 5]`, and then swapping them to get `[4, 1, 5, 3, 1]`.

Therefore, `func_1` alone is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation.

### Conclusion
Since `func_1` does not correctly handle the scenario where the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
