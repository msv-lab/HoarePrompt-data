Based on the initial state provided:

- `index` is defined as `2 + 2t`, where `t` is the final value after all iterations.
- `n` is the last computed value of `n`.
- `arr` is the last computed list of integers.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` applied to each element in `arr`.

The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). 

Since the exact values of `t`, `n`, and the elements of `arr` are not provided, we can only describe the general form of what will be printed. The `results` list contains the outputs of `func_1` applied to each element of `arr`.

Output: **the results of func_1 applied to each element of arr, each result on a new line**
