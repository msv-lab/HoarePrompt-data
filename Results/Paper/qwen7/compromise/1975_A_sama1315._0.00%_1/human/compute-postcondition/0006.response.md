State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6 for all 0 ≤ i < n, `results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `_` is used, which means the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). The initial value of `t` being an integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute; therefore, it needs to be adjusted to ensure `t > 0`.
3. The other variables (`index`, `n`, `arr`, and `results`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop should execute or not, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.
