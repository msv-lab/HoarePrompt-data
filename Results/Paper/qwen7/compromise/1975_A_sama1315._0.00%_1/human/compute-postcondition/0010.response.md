Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list `arr` of n integers where 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6 for all 0 ≤ i < n. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not detailed here.**

This means the function `func_2` takes an integer `t` within the range of 1 to 1000, an integer `n` within the range of 2 to 50, and a list `arr` containing `n` integers, each of which is between 1 and 1,000,000. The exact output of the function is not specified in the given information.
