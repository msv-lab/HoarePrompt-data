Output State: **`a` is `(x, y)`, `b` remains unchanged, `dx` is the first element of `b`, `dy` is the second element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `dx, dy = b` unpacks the tuple `b` into two variables `dx` and `dy`. Since `b` remains unchanged from its initial state, `dx` will take the value of the first element of `b`, and `dy` will take the value of the second element of `b`. The tuple `a` and the variable `b` are updated accordingly.
