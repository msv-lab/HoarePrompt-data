Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order through cyclic shifts. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to minimize the total cost.

For example, consider the input string `101011`. The optimal strategy would be:

1. Choose the substring `[1, 3]` (i.e., "101" -> "011") with a cost of 3.
2. Choose the substring `[4, 6]` (i.e., "011" -> "0011") with a cost of 3.
3. Choose the substring `[5, 6]` (i.e., "0011" -> "00011") with a cost of 2.

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 2 = 8. However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 5, which is not the minimum possible cost.

The program's logic only considers the cost of shifting the first '1' to the beginning of the string, which may not always yield the minimum cost. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
