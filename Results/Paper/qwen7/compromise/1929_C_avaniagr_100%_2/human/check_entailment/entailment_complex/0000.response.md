Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the solution.
2. The program reads the input from standard input, which is indicated by `[*open(0)]`.
3. It processes each test case individually, reading `k`, `x`, and `a` for each case.
4. The conditions for determining whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins are correctly implemented:
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always win enough coins to surpass any limit.
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha needs at least `x + 2` coins to ensure he can win.
   - If `x > k - 1`, Sasha needs to calculate a threshold (`z`) to ensure he can eventually win enough coins.
5. The calculations and comparisons within the conditions match the problem statement.
6. The program outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case based on the calculated conditions.
7. The final state of the program after processing all test cases matches the description provided in the annotations.

Given these points, the annotated program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
