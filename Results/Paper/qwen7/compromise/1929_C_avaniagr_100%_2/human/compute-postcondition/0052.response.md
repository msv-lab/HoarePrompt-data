Postcondition: `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k` is an integer from the split string, `x` is an integer from the split string, `a` is an integer from the split string. The postcondition does not change regardless of whether the condition `a >= x + 2` is true or false, as both the if and else parts do not alter the values of `[*open(0)]`, `k`, `x`, and `a`.
