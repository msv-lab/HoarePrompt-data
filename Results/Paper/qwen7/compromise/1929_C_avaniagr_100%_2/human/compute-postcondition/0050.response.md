Based on the initial state provided:

- `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements. This means that when `open(0)` is called, it reads from standard input (usually the keyboard) and returns a file object. Calling `*open(0)` then unpacks the elements of this file object into a list. Since it's stated that the list has at least 2 elements, let's denote these elements as `element1` and `element2`.

- `k` is an integer from the split string. This implies that the list returned by `open(0)` is split into strings, and one of those strings is converted to an integer to become `k`.

- `x` is an integer from the split string. Another string from the split result is converted to an integer to become `x`.

- `a` is an integer from the split string. Yet another string from the split result is converted to an integer to become `a`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Given the information, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **YES**
