Output State: **`[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k` is the first integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, `a` is the third integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, and `s` is the third element of `[*open(0)]`.**

In this output state, the list `[*open(0)]` remains unchanged except for the fact that its third element has been split into integers `k`, `x`, and `a`. The variable `s` still holds the original third element of the list before splitting.
