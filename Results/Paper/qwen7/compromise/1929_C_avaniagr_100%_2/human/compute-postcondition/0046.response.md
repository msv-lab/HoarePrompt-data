Based on the initial state provided:

- `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements. This means that `[*open(0)]` evaluates to a list containing at least two elements.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained from splitting this list. Since the list contains at least two elements, `k`, `x`, and `a` are derived from these elements, but their specific values are not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
