Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, the variable `z` will have been updated multiple times according to the rule `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` starting from its initial value. The list `[*open(0)]` remains a list with at least 2 elements, `k` is an integer from the split string, and `x` is an integer from the split string. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `a` is less than `z`, then `a` is updated to `z` after all iterations of the loop.**
