Postcondition: **`z` will have been updated multiple times according to the rule `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` starting from its initial value. The list `[*open(0)]` remains a list with at least 2 elements, `k` is an integer from the split string, and `x` is an integer from the split string. The value of `a` is less than `z` after all iterations of the loop.**
