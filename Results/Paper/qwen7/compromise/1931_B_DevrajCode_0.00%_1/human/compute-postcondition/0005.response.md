Output State: **`total_water` is the sum of all integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the amount of water in the corresponding container, and `target` is `total_water // n`; `container` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `container` to 0. This does not affect the values of `total_water`, `n`, `a`, or `target`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `container` is updated to 0.
