Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct because making all containers have the same amount of water is impossible if the total water is not divisible by `n`.

2. If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).

3. It then iterates through each container and checks if the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount accumulates to a negative value. If it does, it means it's impossible to balance the containers to the target amount, so it returns 'No'.

4. If no such accumulation to a negative value occurs during the iteration, it means it is possible to balance the containers, so it returns 'Yes'.

Since the program follows the logic correctly and handles all the constraints mentioned in the problem description, it is correct for every potential case.
