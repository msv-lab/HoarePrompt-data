### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into individual components.
   - It extracts `n` (the number of containers) and the list `a` (amounts of water in each container).
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, a)`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Step 1: Check Divisibility:**
     ```python
     total_water = sum(a)
     if total_water % n != 0:
         return 'No'
     ```
     This check ensures that the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct because redistributing the water evenly among `n` containers is impossible if the total is not divisible by `n`.

   - **Step 2: Calculate Target Amount:**
     ```python
     target = total_water // n
     ```
     This calculates the target amount of water each container should have if the water were distributed evenly.

   - **Step 3: Iterate Through Containers:**
     ```python
     container = 0
     for water in a:
         container += water - target
         if container < 0:
             return 'No'
     ```
     This loop iterates through each container and checks if the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount ever becomes negative. If it does, it means it is impossible to redistribute the water to achieve the target amount without some containers having less than zero water, so it returns 'No'.

   - **Step 4: Return 'Yes':**
     ```python
     return 'Yes'
     ```
     If the loop completes without finding a negative cumulative difference, it means the water can be redistributed to achieve the target amount, so it returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. It handles all edge cases, including the divisibility check and the cumulative difference check. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
