Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions.
2. The provided code defines a function `func_1()` which processes each test case.
3. It calculates the cumulative count of 1s (`ones`) and the adjusted sum (`sum`) up to each index.
4. For each query, it checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds true.
5. This condition is derived from the requirement that the subarray must be good, meaning there should exist another array `b` with certain properties.
6. The logic in the code correctly implements the necessary calculations and checks for the condition.
7. The code handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.
8. There are no apparent logical errors or missing parts in the provided code.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for determining if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
