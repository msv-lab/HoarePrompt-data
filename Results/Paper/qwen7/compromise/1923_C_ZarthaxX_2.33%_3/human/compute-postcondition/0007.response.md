State before the loop starts: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of the array `nums`, `q` is an input integer representing the number of subarray queries, `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where each element represents the cumulative count of 1s up to that index in `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to that index minus the index itself.

Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.

- The loop variable `_` is used in the loop head, but it is typically an underscore indicating that the variable is not used within the loop body. Therefore, we do not need to adjust its value.
- The loop runs `q` times, so `q` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `q` to ensure that the loop can execute.

State: **`q` must be greater than 0**
