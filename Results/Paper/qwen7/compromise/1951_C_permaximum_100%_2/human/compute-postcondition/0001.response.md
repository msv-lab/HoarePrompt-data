Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and `pq` has been transformed into a heap.**

The `heapq.heapify(pq)` function transforms the list `pq` into a heap in-place. This means that the structure of `pq` changes such that it satisfies the heap property (for a min-heap, the parent node is smaller than or equal to its children). However, the content of the list remains the same; only the order of elements might change to satisfy the heap property. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
