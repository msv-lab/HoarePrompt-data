The only variable in the loop head is `tickets_bought`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tickets_bought`. If `tickets_bought` is less than `k`, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0, and `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end. For the loop to execute the first time, `tickets_bought` needs to be less than `k`.

Since `tickets_bought` is currently 0, the condition `tickets_bought < k` will be true as long as `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `k` because it is already a positive integer.

However, we need to ensure that the loop can proceed with the given initial values. The only state that needs to be adjusted is to confirm that `tickets_bought` is indeed 0, which it already is.

State: **`total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and `tickets_bought` is 0**
