Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to generate a string `s` by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times. However, this approach does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets will be subsequences of `s`.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to construct a string `s` that includes all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The solution should consider the combinatorial nature of the problem and ensure that every combination of length `n` from the first `k` alphabets is included as a subsequence in `s`.

Here's an example of how the correct solution might look:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    # Generate all possible subsequences of length n from the first k alphabets
    alphabet = ''.join(chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(k))
    subsequences = [''.join(p) for p in itertools.product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
    
    # Construct the shortest string that contains all these subsequences
    def build_string(subsequences):
        result = []
        for seq in subsequences:
            found = False
            for i in range(len(result)):
                if result[i:i+len(seq)] == list(seq):
                    found = True
                    break
                elif result[i:i+len(seq)] < list(seq):
                    result.insert(i, seq)
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                result.append(seq)
        return ''.join(result)
    
    return build_string(subsequences)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    res = func_1()
    print(res)
```

This solution uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible subsequences of length `n` from the first `k` alphabets. Then, it constructs the shortest string that contains all these subsequences as a subsequence.
