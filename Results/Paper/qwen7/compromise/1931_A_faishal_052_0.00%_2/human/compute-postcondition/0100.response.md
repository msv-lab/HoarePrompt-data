Output State: `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ..., lex, ..., lex].

Explanation: The loop runs for 3 iterations as specified. After all iterations, the value of `j` remains unchanged at 2. The variable `k` will be 2 after the last iteration. Since the loop prints characters based on the elements in `arr`, and `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ...], it means `arr` contains multiple occurrences of the string "lex". After 3 iterations, the loop has printed the first 3 elements of `arr`, which are all "lex". Therefore, the final state of `arr` remains a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ..., lex, ...].
