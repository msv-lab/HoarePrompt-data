Output State: **`j` is 0 or 1; `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52; `arr` is a list containing the element 26.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially empty, after appending `26`, it contains only one element, which is `26`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
