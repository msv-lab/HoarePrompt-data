Output State: **The loop will execute exactly 3 times since the range is specified as 2, which means the loop runs from 0 to 1 (inclusive), making it run 2 iterations in total. After these 2 iterations, `j` will be 2, `lex` will be either between 0 and 26 or greater than 26, and `arr` will be [26, 1, 26] if `lex` is greater than 26, otherwise `arr` will be [26, 1, 1].**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes its executions, the variable `j` will be 2, `lex` will be a value that has been reduced by 52 (either 26 twice or 26 once and 1), and the list `arr` will contain three elements: two 26s and one 1, depending on the initial value of `lex`.
