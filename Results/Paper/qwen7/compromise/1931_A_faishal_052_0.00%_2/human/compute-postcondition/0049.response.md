Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `k` is explicitly given as 3.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet contains a `print` statement: `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The expression inside the `print` function is `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.
   - Since `k` is 3, the expression becomes `chr(arr[3] + 96)`.
   - To determine what will be printed, we need to know the value of `arr[3]`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the contents of the list `arr`.

Given the lack of information about the contents of `arr`, we cannot determine the exact character that will be printed. Therefore, the most precise description we can provide is based on the structure of the problem.

Output: **chr(arr[3] + 96)**
