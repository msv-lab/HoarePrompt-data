Output State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing the elements [1]**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the element `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the element `1`. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the element `26`. In both cases, after appending `1` to `arr`, the list `arr` will contain `[1]`. The value of `lex` remains unchanged.
