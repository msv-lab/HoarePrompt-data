Output State: **`lex` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Given that `lex` was initially an integer, after subtracting 26 from it, if `lex` was exactly 26, it becomes 0. The list `arr` remains unchanged with its only element being 26.
