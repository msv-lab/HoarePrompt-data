Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `k` is explicitly given as 3.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet is `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `k` is 3.

However, the value of `arr` is not explicitly provided. Since the problem does not give us the value of `arr`, we cannot determine the exact character that will be printed. But we can describe it in terms of the array `arr`.

Given `k = 3`, the expression inside the `chr` function becomes `arr[3] + 96`. The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character. The value `96` corresponds to the ASCII value of `'a'` minus 1 (`'a'` has an ASCII value of 97).

Therefore, if `arr[3]` is an integer `n`, then `chr(n + 96)` will convert `n + 96` to the corresponding character.

Since the exact value of `arr[3]` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the array `arr`.

Output: **chr(arr[3] + 96)**
