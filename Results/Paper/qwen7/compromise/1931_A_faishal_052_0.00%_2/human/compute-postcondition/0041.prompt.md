Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is not mentioned, `i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq cases \leq 100\); `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is either 0 or 1, `lex` is a value between 2 and 27, and `arr` contains the value 1. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `j` remains 0. If `lex` is between 27 and 52, `j` becomes 1 and `arr` is updated to contain the value 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `lex` is between 1 and 51, `arr` is [26, 1] if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, otherwise `arr` is [26, 26].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `lex` is either between 0 and 26 or greater than 26, and `arr` is [26, 1, 26] if `lex` is greater than 26, otherwise `arr` is [26, 1, 1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
