Output State: `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ...], and the loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'l', 'e', 'x' in sequence without spaces.

Explanation: The loop runs for 3 iterations as specified by `range(3)`. After all iterations, the value of `k` will be 2 (since it increments by 1 in each iteration starting from 0). The variable `j` remains unchanged at 2. The list `arr` remains a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ...]. The loop prints the characters 'l', 'e', 'x' from the list `arr` using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` which converts the ASCII value of the character to its corresponding letter in the alphabet.
