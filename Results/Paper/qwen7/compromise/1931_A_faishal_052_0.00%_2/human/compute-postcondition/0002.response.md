Output State: **`total` is not mentioned, `i` is 0 (or 1 if the loop starts from 1), `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq cases \leq 100\); `arr` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `arr`. The values of `total` and `i` remain unchanged, and `cases` retains its input value.
