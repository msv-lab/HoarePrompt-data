Output State: **`j` is 0; `arr` is a list containing 26; `lex` is an input integer greater than or equal to 52**

The code appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was initially an empty list, after appending 26, it contains the single element 26. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial states.
