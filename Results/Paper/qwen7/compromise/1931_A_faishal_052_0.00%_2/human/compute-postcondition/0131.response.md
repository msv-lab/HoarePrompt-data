Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs for `range(2)`, meaning it will iterate twice (when `j` is 0 and then 1).

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition does not depend on `j` directly. Instead, it depends on the postconditions related to `lex` and `arr`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the element 1. Otherwise, `arr` contains the element 26.

4. **Loop Iteration**: Since the loop runs for `range(2)`, it will execute two times regardless of the value of `lex`. However, we need to consider the state of `lex` and `arr` at the start of each iteration.

5. **Adjusting States**: We need to ensure that the state of `lex` and `arr` remains consistent with the postcondition at the start of each iteration. Since the loop does not modify `lex` or `arr` directly, the state of these variables should remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the states of `lex` and `arr` do not change within the loop body. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the element 26.**
