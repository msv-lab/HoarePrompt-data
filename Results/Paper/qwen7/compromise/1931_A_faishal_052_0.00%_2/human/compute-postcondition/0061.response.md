Output State: **`j` is 0; `arr` is a list containing the element 26; `lex` is an integer equal to `lex - 26`.**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is updated to its value minus 26. Since `lex` was initially an integer greater than 26 and less than 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` will be an integer between 0 and 26. However, the exact value is not specified, so it is described as `lex` is an integer equal to `lex - 26`. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
