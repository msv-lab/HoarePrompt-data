Postcondition: `j` is either 0 or 1, `lex` is a value between 2 and 27, and `arr` contains the value 1. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, then `j` remains 0. If `lex` is greater than 26, then `j` becomes 1 and `lex` is adjusted to be within the range of 2 to 52, with `arr` containing the value 26.
