Postcondition: `j` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either 1 or 26 depending on whether `lex` is less than or equal to 26, and `lex` is an integer adjusted according to the following rules: if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains 1 and `lex` is set to `lex - 1`; if `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` contains 26 and `lex` is set to `lex - 26`; otherwise, `arr` contains 26 and `lex` remains an integer greater than or equal to 26.
