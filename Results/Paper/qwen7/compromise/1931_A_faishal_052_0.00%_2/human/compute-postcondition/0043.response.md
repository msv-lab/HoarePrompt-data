Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is either between 0 and 26 or greater than 26, `arr` is [1, 26, `lex`]**

Explanation: The `arr.sort()` command sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Given the initial state where `arr` is `[26, 1, lex]`, after sorting, the list becomes `[1, 26, lex]`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
