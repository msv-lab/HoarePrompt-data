Output State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing the elements 1 and 26**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the element `26` to the list `arr`. Initially, if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the element `1`; if `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` contains the element `26`. In either case, after appending `26` to `arr`, `arr` will contain both `1` and `26`.
