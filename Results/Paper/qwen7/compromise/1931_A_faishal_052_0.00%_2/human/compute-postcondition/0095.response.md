Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for k in range(3)`. This means the variable `k` is being iterated over the range from 0 to 2.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 2
   - `k` must be 0 (though this seems contradictory since `k` should be incremented in each iteration)
   - `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements `[lex, ...]`

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `k` is being incremented in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `k` was 0.
   - For the next iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1, so `k` will be 1.
   - The other variables (`j` and `arr`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `j` remains 2.
   - `k` changes to 1.
   - `arr` remains a sorted list containing the elements `[lex, ...]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`j` is 2, `k` is 1, `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ...]**
