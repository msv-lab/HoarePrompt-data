Output State: **`lex` is an integer with a value between 26 and 26; `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

Explanation: The initial value of `lex` is an integer greater than 26 and less than 52. After executing `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` is reduced by 26. Since `lex` was initially between 26 and 52 (exclusive), subtracting 26 from it results in a value between 0 and 26 (exclusive). However, since the lower bound of `lex` was strictly greater than 26, the new value of `lex` is exactly 26. The value of `arr` remains unchanged.
