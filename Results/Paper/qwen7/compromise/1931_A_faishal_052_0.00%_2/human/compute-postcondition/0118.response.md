Postcondition: `lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, then `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is greater than 26, then `arr` contains the element 26, where `arr` contains the element 26 if `lex` is less than 52, and `arr` contains the element 26 if `lex` is 52 or greater.
