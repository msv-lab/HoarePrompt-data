Output State: **`j` is 0, `j` will take on the values 0 and 1 during the loop iterations, and the current value of `lex` is less than or equal to 26; `arr` is [1]**.

The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the list `arr`. Since `j` and `lex` are not affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the list `arr`.
