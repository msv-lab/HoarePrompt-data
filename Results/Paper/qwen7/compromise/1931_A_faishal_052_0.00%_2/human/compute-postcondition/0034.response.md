Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is `lex` - 26, `arr` is [26, 1, 26]**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. The initial value of `lex` is between 1 and 51, so after subtracting 26, `lex` will be between -25 and 25 (inclusive). However, since the exact initial value of `lex` is not specified, we express it as `lex - 26`. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
