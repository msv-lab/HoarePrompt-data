Output State: **The list `arr` will now contain either 1, 26, or both, depending on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is 0, `arr` will contain only 26s. If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` will contain one 1 and the rest 26s. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` will contain only 1s. Additionally, the list `arr` will have appended the value of `lex` to itself.**

This means that the list `arr` will now include the new value of `lex` appended to its existing contents, while the conditions regarding the values of `lex` remain unchanged.
