The only objects in the loop head are variables `k` and `lex`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, and `k` must be less than 3. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. Additionally, since `k` must still be less than 3, this condition remains true.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`arr` is a list containing sorted elements starting with 1s followed by 26s, and ends with the value of `lex`, `k` is 1, `lex` is an integer**
