Output State: **The list `arr` will contain either 1, 26, or both, depending on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is 0, `arr` will contain only 26s. If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` will contain one 1 and the rest 26s. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` will contain only 1s.**

This output state describes the final condition of the list `arr` after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop runs twice for each iteration of `j` in the range 2, so it will run a total of 4 times. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, the list `arr` will be filled with 1s and/or 26s according to the conditions specified in the loop body.
