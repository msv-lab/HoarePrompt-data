Output State: **`lex` is an integer, and the value of `lex` is greater than 26, and `lex` is greater than or equal to 52; `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

Explanation: The code appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Since `lex` was initially an integer greater than 26 and greater than or equal to 52, these conditions remain unchanged. The list `arr` now contains the element 26.
