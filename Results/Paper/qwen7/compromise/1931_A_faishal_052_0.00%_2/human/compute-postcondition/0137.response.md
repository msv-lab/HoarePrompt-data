Output State: **`lex` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the element 26.**

Explanation: The initial value of `lex` is an integer. After executing `lex = lex - 26`, if `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 26, it would now be reduced by 26. However, since no specific initial value of `lex` was given other than it being an integer, we assume the simplest case where `lex` was exactly 26, making it 0 after the subtraction. The list `arr` remains unchanged with its single element being 26.
