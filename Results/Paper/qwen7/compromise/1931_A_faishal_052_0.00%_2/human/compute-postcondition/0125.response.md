Output State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing the element 26.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append(26)` appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. This operation does not affect the value of `lex`. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, the conditions about its value in relation to 25 and 52 remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `arr` now containing the element 26, while the value of `lex` remains as initially defined.
