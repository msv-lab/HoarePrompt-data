Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for k in range(3)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `k`.

2. **Determine the current state of `k`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than 3. Since `k` is currently 1, it needs to be incremented to 2 for the next iteration to occur.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the value of `k` to 2 for the next iteration of the loop.

5. **Maintain the state of other variables**: The other variables (`j` and `arr`) are not part of the loop head, so their values remain unchanged.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `k` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list containing the elements [lex, ...]**
