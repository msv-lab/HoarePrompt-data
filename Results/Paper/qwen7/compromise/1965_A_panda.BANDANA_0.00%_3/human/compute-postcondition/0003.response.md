Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**

This means the function takes in a series of test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and a list of n integers. It then processes these inputs according to some unspecified logic and returns a result for each test case.
