### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `input()` and converts it to an integer.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
   
3. **Logic Check**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
     - This condition is crucial because:
       - If `n - m` is even, it means the difference can be balanced by adding and removing cubes in pairs.
       - If `n - m` is non-negative, it ensures that `n` is at least as large as `m`, meaning it is possible to reach `m` cubes starting from zero cubes.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case based on the logic implemented.

### Evaluation:

- The function summary provided accurately describes the behavior of `func_1()`. The function processes two integers `n` and `m`, checks if the difference `n - m` is even and non-negative, and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly.
- The logic implemented in the program matches the requirements of the problem statement. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` ensures that it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the program that would lead to incorrect results.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
