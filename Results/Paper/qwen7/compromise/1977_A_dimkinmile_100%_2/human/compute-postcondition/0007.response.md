Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes two positive integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (t being a positive integer). It does not return any value directly but implies processing or returning a result based on n, m, and t.**

Given the constraints, the function likely takes no explicit parameters but uses predefined or global values for `n`, `m`, and `t` to perform some operation or calculation. However, since the exact operation is not specified, the focus here is on the parameters and their constraints rather than the specific return value.
