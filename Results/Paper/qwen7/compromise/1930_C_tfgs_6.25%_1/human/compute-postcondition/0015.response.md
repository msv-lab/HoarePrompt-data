Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is the loop index, which starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `a` is a list whose values are sorted in descending order.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `a`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `len(a)` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1, the loop will start with `i` being 0.
   - For the loop to execute, `len(a)` must be at least 1.

5. **Consider other given states**:
   - `cnt` is `n - len(a)`.
   - `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new sorted list `a`.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Since these additional states (`cnt`, `counter`, `ans`, and `n`) are not directly related to the loop's execution condition, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` starting at 0 and `len(a)` being at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `len(a)` must be at least 1**
