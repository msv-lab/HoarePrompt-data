Output State: **`cnt` is `n - len(a)`, the value of `a[i]` for each valid index `i` (where \(0 \leq i < n\)) is now sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new sorted list `a`, and `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is assigned the value `n - len(a)`. The other variables (`a`, `counter`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
