Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, resulting in `i` being equal to `len(a)`. The list `ans` contains all elements from the original list `a` in the order they were appended, minus any decrements due to the condition inside the loop. Specifically, for each `a[i - 1]`, if there was enough `cnt` and matching elements in `counter`, some values were appended to `ans` based on the decrement logic. After all iterations, `cnt` is fully exhausted (`cnt == 0`), and `counter` for each element in `a` reflects the total number of times that element was decremented, which could be negative if the element was decremented more times than it existed in the list initially. `ans` is a list that captures the decrement logic applied to each element in `a` as per the loop's conditions, and `counter` reflects the final count of each element after all operations.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is a list where the last element is now equal to the second last element minus 1, `cnt` must be greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is a list where the last element is now equal to the third last element minus 2, `cnt` is greater than 0 (decreased by 1)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
