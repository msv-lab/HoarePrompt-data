Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(adv)`. This means the loop depends on the variable `j` and the value `adv`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` has a new element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
   - `a` retains its original value.
   - `j` is `j + 1`.

3. **Determine the adjustments needed**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`, and it must be incremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - Since `j` was `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 2`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` needs to be adjusted to `j + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ans` has a new element which is `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`, `a` retains its original value, `j` is `j + 2`**.

To simplify the expression for `ans`:
- The new element added to `ans` in the previous iteration was `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
- For the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`, so the new element will be `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`.

So, the final state is:

State: **`ans` has a new element which is `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`, `a` retains its original value, `j` is `j + 2`**.
