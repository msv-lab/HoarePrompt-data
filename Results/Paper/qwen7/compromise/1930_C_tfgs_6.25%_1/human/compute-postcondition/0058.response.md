Output State: **`ans` now contains the element `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1` and also the newly appended element `a[i - 1] - j - 1`; `a` retains its original value; `j` is now `j + 2`.**

This means that the list `ans` has been updated to include an additional element, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. The variable `a` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the variable `j` has been incremented by 2.
