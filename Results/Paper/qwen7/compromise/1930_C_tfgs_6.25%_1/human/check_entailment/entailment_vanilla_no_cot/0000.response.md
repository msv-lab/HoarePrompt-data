Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to generate the lexicographically largest possible array `b`. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Insertion and Deletion**:
   - The program tries to add `i + 1` to each element `a_i` and then inserts it into a set `S`. However, it doesn't handle the deletion of elements from `a` and the subsequent reordering of indices correctly. The program directly manipulates the set `S` without properly simulating the deletion process as described in the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing Array `b`**:
   - The program constructs `b` by sorting the elements of `S` in reverse order. However, this approach does not ensure that the lexicographically largest possible `b` is generated. The logic for constructing `b` needs to consider the constraints and requirements more carefully.

3. **Incorrect Use of `Counter`**:
   - The use of `Counter` and converting the set back to a list is unnecessary and complicates the solution. The problem requires a more direct approach to ensure that the elements are inserted and deleted in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of `b`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the operations step-by-step while ensuring that the set `S` is updated correctly. Here's a revised version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize the set S and the result list
        S = set()
        result = []
        
        # Process each element in a
        for i in range(n):
            # Insert a_i + i into S
            S.add(a[i] + i)
            
            # If S already contains the current value, remove the smallest element
            if len(S) > n - i:
                min_val = min(S)
                S.remove(min_val)
            
            # Sort S in descending order and append the largest element to result
            sorted_S = sorted(S, reverse=True)
            result.append(sorted_S[0])
        
        print(*result)

# Example usage
func_1()
```

This approach ensures that the set `S` is updated correctly and the result list `b` is constructed in a way that maximizes its lexicographical order.
