Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points distributed between two players (1+1).

3. **Condition for No Draws**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This condition ensures that the highest score (`p3`) is at least as high as the combined scores of the other two players. This logic is correct because if `p3` is higher than or equal to `p1 + p2`, it implies that the highest scorer has won all games against the other two, leading to a maximum of 0 draws.

4. **Loop Logic for Draws**: The loop logic aims to find the maximum number of draws. However, there are some issues with the loop:
   - The loop condition `y >= x` should be `y >= 0` to ensure it runs properly.
   - The logic inside the loop to increment `x` and decrement `y` is flawed. The goal is to maximize the number of draws, but the current logic does not correctly handle the scenario where draws can be maximized without violating the constraints.
   - The loop should check if `p1 - x == p2 - y` to ensure the scores are balanced, which would indicate a draw. Instead, the current logic increments `x` and decrements `y` without checking if they balance the scores.

5. **Final Output**: The program prints `-1` if no valid solution is found, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given these points, the current implementation has logical flaws in determining the maximum number of draws. However, the overall structure of handling test cases and checking basic conditions is correct.

Correctness: **False**
