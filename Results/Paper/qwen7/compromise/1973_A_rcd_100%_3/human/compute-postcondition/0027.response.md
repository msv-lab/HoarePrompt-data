Output State: **`x` is either 0 or 1; `y` must be greater than or equal to `x` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `x` and `y`, but it indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block we are in. Therefore, the conditions and values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and we simply note that we have broken out of the loop or conditional statement.
