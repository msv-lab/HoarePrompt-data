Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is either 0 or 1.
- `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`.

The expression to be evaluated and printed is `p1 - x + p3`.

Since the values of `p1` and `p3` are not explicitly given, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we know that `x` can only be 0 or 1. 

Let's break it down:

1. If `x = 0`, the expression simplifies to `p1 - 0 + p3 = p1 + p3`.
2. If `x = 1`, the expression simplifies to `p1 - 1 + p3 = p1 + p3 - 1`.

Given that we do not have the explicit values of `p1` and `p3`, the output will depend on these unknown values. Therefore, the output will be in terms of `p1` and `p3` with the appropriate adjustment based on the value of `x`.

Output: **p1 + p3 - x**
