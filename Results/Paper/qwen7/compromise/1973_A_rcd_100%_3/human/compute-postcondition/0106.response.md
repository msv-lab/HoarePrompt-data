To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `y >= x`.

Given the postconditions:
- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
- `_` is 3.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even.
- `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
- `p3` is at least 3.
- Either `x` remains 0 with `y` being 0 (if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`), or `x` is 1 and `y` is 0 (if `p1 - x > p2 - y`).

We need to ensure that the loop condition `y >= x` holds true for the next iteration.

Let's analyze the possible values of `x` and `y`:
1. If `x` is 0, then `y` must be 0 for the loop to continue (`y >= x` is satisfied).
2. If `x` is 1, then `y` must be 0 for the loop to continue (`y >= x` is satisfied).

Since the loop condition is `y >= x`, the only variables that affect this condition are `x` and `y`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `y` is at least as large as `x` for the loop to continue.

Given the current state:
- `x` is either 0 or 1.
- `y` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must remain 0 when `x` is 0, or `y` must remain 0 when `x` is 1. In both cases, the condition `y >= x` is already satisfied.

Thus, no adjustments are necessary for the states of `x` and `y` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

However, since the problem asks us to adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, and given the constraints of the loop condition, we can conclude that no specific adjustments are required beyond ensuring the loop condition is met.

State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 3, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `p3` is at least 3, and either `x` remains 0 with `y` being 0 (if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`), or `x` is 1 and `y` is 0 (if `p1 - x > p2 - y`).**
