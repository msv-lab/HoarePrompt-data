Output State: **`x` is 1, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and `p1 - 1 > p2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is decremented by 1, but the initial value of `y` was not specified. Since no initial value for `y` was given, we cannot determine its new value. However, we know that `y` was part of the condition `p1 - 1 > p2 - y`, which now becomes `p1 - 1 > p2 - (y - 1)`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
