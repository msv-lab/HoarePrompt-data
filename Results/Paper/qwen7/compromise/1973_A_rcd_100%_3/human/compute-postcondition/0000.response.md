Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, after executing the code, `t` will now hold the specific integer input value, which is within the given range. All other conditions and constraints remain valid, but the exact value of `t` is now determined by the user's input.
