Based on the initial state and the given conditions:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500.
- `_` is 2.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even.
- `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`.
- `x` is either 0 or 1.
- `y` is 1.

The print statement is `print(p1 + p2)`. 

From the conditions, we know that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. This implies that `p1 + p2` must have the opposite parity (odd/even) of `p3` because the sum of three numbers being even means the sum of two of them (`p1 + p2`) plus the third (`p3`) must result in an even number. Since `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, it does not affect the parity of `p1 + p2`.

Given that the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p1 + p2` must also be even. However, the specific values of `p1` and `p2` are not explicitly provided, only their sum's parity is known.

Therefore, the print statement will output an even number, but we cannot determine the exact numerical value without more information about `p1` and `p2`.

Output: **an even number (where the number is the sum of p1 and p2, and both p1 and p2 are integers such that their sum is even)**
