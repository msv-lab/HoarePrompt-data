Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 3, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The precondition that `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are assigned values from the input such that their sum is even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, and `p3` is at least 3, remains valid. The loop continues to the next iteration.
