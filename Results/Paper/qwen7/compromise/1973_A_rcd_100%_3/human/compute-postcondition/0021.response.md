Output State: **`x` is 1, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, and `p1 - 1 > p2 - y`**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and the condition involving `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
