`y` is decremented by 1. Initially, `y` must be greater than or equal to `x`, which is 1. Since `y` is decremented by 1, the new value of `y` is now 0, which still satisfies the condition of being greater than or equal to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, `_` is 3, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers with the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` being even, `p3` is less than or equal to `p1 + p2`, `p3` is at least 3, `x` is 1, `y` is 0.**
