Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input to the variable `t`. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged from their initial state, where they are integers such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
