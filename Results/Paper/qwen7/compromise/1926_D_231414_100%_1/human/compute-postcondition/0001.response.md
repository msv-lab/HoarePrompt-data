Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and the initial state of `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation: The code sets `check` to the value `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is 2147483647. This does not affect the values of `times` or `t`. Therefore, their initial states remain unchanged.
