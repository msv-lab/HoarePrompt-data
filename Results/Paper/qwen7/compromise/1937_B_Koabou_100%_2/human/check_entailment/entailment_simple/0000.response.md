### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads the input values for `n` and the two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
   - This part of the code correctly initializes the necessary variables and handles the input.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Path**:
   - The code attempts to find the lexicographically smallest path by checking certain conditions.
   - Specifically, it checks if there is a point where the top row changes from '0' to '1' and the bottom row changes from '1' to '0'. If such a point exists, it constructs the string `s` accordingly.
   - However, the logic for constructing `s` and determining the lexicographically smallest path is flawed. The code only considers one specific condition and does not account for all possible paths.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths**:
   - The code sets `t` to 1 without considering the actual number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - The loop that updates `t` is not correctly implemented to count the number of valid paths.

4. **Output**:
   - The code prints `s` and `t` but does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `n = 2`, `a[0] = "00"`, `a[1] = "00"`
  - Expected Output: `000` and `2`
  - Actual Output: `000` and `1`

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `n = 4`, `a[0] = "1101"`, `a[1] = "1100"`
  - Expected Output: `11000` and `1`
  - Actual Output: `000` and `1`

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `n = 8`, `a[0] = "00100111"`, `a[1] = "11101101"`
  - Expected Output: `001001101` and `4`
  - Actual Output: `000` and `1`

From these examples, it is clear that the code does not correctly identify the lexicographically smallest path and does not count the number of such paths accurately.

### Conclusion:

The given code is incorrect because it does not properly handle the problem requirements. It fails to correctly identify the lexicographically smallest path and does not count the number of such paths.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
