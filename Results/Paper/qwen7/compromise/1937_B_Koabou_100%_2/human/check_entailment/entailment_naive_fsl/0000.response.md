Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Here's a detailed breakdown of why it fails:

1. **Incorrect Path Selection Logic**: The program attempts to find a specific pattern to form the smallest string but does not handle all possible cases. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   2
   001
   110
   ```
   The program will incorrectly produce `00110` instead of `00010`. This is because the program does not correctly handle the scenario where both rows have a `1` at the same position, leading to an incorrect path selection.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not properly handle the case where both rows have `1`s at the same positions, which could lead to multiple valid paths yielding the same lexicographically smallest string. For instance, in the example provided in the problem statement:
   ```
   8
   00100111
   11101101
   ```
   The program should output `001001101` and `4`, but it incorrectly outputs `001001101` and `1`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
