Functionality: **The function `make_stairs` takes an index `i` and modifies the list `arr` based on certain conditions. It also appends operations to the list `res`. If `i` is 0, it adds a tuple to `res` and updates `arr[start_index]` to 1. If `i` is not 0, it recursively calls itself with `i-1` and performs additional operations. The function does not return any value and leaves the state of `arr` and `res` modified according to the conditions checked.**
