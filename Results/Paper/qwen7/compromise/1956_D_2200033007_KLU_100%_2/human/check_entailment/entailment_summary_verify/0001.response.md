### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided code based on the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Problem Description Recap:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations, where each operation sets a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray.

2. **Function Summaries Recap:**
   - `func_1` is intended to calculate the maximum possible sum using dynamic programming.
   - `func_2` is supposed to find the operations needed to achieve that sum.
   - `make_stairs` is a helper function that sets up the array to achieve the desired MEX values.

3. **Analysis of Provided Code:**
   - **`func_1`**: This function is trying to calculate the maximum sum using a recursive approach. However, it does not correctly compute the MEX value for any subarray. The logic inside the function is complex and does not align with the problem requirements.
   - **`func_2`**: This function is supposed to find the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`. However, it does not correctly identify the subarrays that need to be modified to achieve the maximum sum. The logic here is also flawed.
   - **`make_stairs`**: This function is intended to set up the array to achieve the desired MEX values. However, it is not used correctly and does not handle the MEX values properly.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
     - Calculate the MEX value for any subarray.
     - Use the MEX value to update the subarray.
     - Ensure that the operations do not exceed \(5 \times 10^5\).

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution. The functions do not properly calculate the MEX values or update the array as required.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the MEX values and does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
