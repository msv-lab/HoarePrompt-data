Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations that update a subarray to a specific value (the MEX of the subarray). The solution must ensure that the sum is maximized and the operations are recorded.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function computes the maximum sum that can be achieved by updating subarrays. It uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations. The logic seems to be correct in terms of recursion and memoization, but the implementation of the MEX calculation and the recursive updates are not clear from the provided code.
   - **func_2**: This function determines the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. It checks if the current subarray can be updated to its maximum possible value and records the operations. The logic here is also somewhat unclear due to the lack of explicit MEX computation and the recursive nature of the function.
   - **make_stairs**: This function is intended to create a staircase pattern in the array, which helps in achieving the maximum sum. However, the function's implementation is incomplete and lacks clarity, especially regarding how it updates the array and records operations.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - The functions do not explicitly compute the MEX of a subarray, which is crucial for determining the optimal value to update the subarray to.
   - The recursive nature of the functions suggests a dynamic programming approach, but the base cases and transitions are not clearly defined in terms of MEX computation.
   - The functions do not provide a clear way to record and return the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

Given the incomplete and unclear nature of the functions, particularly in terms of MEX computation and operation recording, it is difficult to conclude that the provided code correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
