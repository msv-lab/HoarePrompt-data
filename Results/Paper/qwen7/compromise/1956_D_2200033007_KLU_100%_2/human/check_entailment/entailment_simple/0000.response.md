### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray. We need to ensure the solution is correct by verifying the logic in the provided functions.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - This function computes the maximum possible sum of a subarray `[start_index, end_index]` by recursively breaking down the subarray into smaller parts.
   - The base case handles when `start_index == end_index`, returning the maximum of 1 and `arr[start_index]`.
   - For other cases, it considers splitting the subarray into two parts and recursively computing the sum for each part, adding the middle element `arr[i]` to the sum.
   - The function uses memoization via `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - This function determines the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - If the length of the subarray is 1 and the element is 0, it directly returns the operation to set that element to 1.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the length of the subarray, it returns the operation to set the entire subarray to the MEX value.
   - Otherwise, it recursively finds the optimal operations by considering splits around the middle element that gives the maximum sum.

4. **Analyzing `make_stairs`**:
   - This function constructs the operations to achieve the desired MEX value for a subarray.
   - It checks if the subarray already matches the required pattern and returns if it does.
   - If not, it recursively adjusts the subarray to match the required pattern, appending the necessary operations to the result list `res`.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic seems sound: it correctly identifies the maximum possible sum and the operations needed to achieve it.
   - The recursive approach ensures that all possible splits are considered, and the memoization helps in avoiding redundant calculations.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` work together to find the maximum sum and the corresponding operations.

### Correctness:
**True**
