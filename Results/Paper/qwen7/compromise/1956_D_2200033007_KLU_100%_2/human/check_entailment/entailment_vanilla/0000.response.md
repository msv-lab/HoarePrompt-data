### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code includes three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs`.
   - `func_1` seems to be intended to calculate the maximum possible sum using dynamic programming.
   - `func_2` is supposed to find the operations needed to achieve that sum.
   - `make_stairs` is a helper function that sets up the array to achieve the desired MEX values.

3. **Issues Identified:**
   - **Incorrect Use of Dynamic Programming:** The `func_1` function uses a recursive approach to calculate the maximum sum, but it does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the MEX value and updating the array.
   - **Lack of MEX Calculation:** The code does not actually compute the MEX value for any subarray. Instead, it tries to maximize the sum using a recursive approach without considering the actual MEX values.
   - **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`:** The logic in `func_2` is flawed because it does not correctly identify the subarrays that need to be modified to achieve the maximum sum.
   - **No Handling of MEX Values:** The `make_stairs` function is not used correctly and does not handle the MEX values properly.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the MEX values and does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements.

**Correctness: **False**
