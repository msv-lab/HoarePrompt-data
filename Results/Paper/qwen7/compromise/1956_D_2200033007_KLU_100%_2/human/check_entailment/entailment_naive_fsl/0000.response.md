Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` do not seem to address the problem of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations. Instead, they appear to be implementing a dynamic programming approach to solve a different problem, possibly related to finding the maximum subarray sum, which is not aligned with the problem description.

The problem requires using the operation of setting a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray, but the provided functions do not implement this logic. They also do not return the required output format, which includes the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The expected output would be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the provided program does not produce this output, indicating that it does not correctly solve the problem as described.
