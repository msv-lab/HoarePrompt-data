Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations. Each operation involves setting a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of that subarray.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` is used to calculate the maximum possible sum of the array elements by considering different ways to partition the array and applying the MEX operation.
   - The function uses recursion and memoization to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The logic seems sound for calculating the maximum sum, but we need to ensure it correctly handles all edge cases and partitions.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` generates the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It checks various conditions to determine the optimal way to apply the MEX operation.
   - The function appears to handle the generation of operations correctly based on the maximum sum calculated.

4. **Analyzing `make_stairs`**:
   - This function is called within `func_2` when the array segment needs to be transformed into a specific pattern to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It ensures that the array segments are set to the appropriate values to maximize the sum.
   - The function correctly modifies the array and records the operations needed.

5. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The main program calls `func_1` to get the maximum sum.
   - Based on the maximum sum, `func_2` generates the necessary operations.
   - The operations are printed out in the required format.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code seems to correctly implement the solution for the problem. It uses dynamic programming (`func_1`) to find the maximum sum and backtracking (`func_2` and `make_stairs`) to generate the operations needed to achieve that sum.

Correctness: **True**
