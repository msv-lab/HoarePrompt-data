You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that `0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30`. It evaluates each inner list according to specific conditions and returns a list of results. Each result in the returned list is either a non-negative integer representing the number of equal matches or `-1` if the conditions are not met.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Cases Initialization**: 
   - The program initializes `t` to 7 and defines a list `cas_de_test` containing predefined test cases. This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes `t` and `cas_de_test` as input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case `(p1, p2, p3)`, it calculates the total points (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It checks if the total points are even (`if total_points % 2 != 0`). If not, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an inconsistency. This check is correct.
   - It calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`). This calculation is correct.
   - It checks if the total number of matches exceeds 3 or if `p3` is greater than the total number of matches (`if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`). If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an inconsistency. This check is correct.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and then divides by 2 to get the number of draws (`egalites // 2`). This calculation is correct.
   - If the calculated number of draws is negative, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an inconsistency. This check is correct.
   - Otherwise, it appends the number of draws to the results.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results of each test case using `'\n'.join(map(str, resultats))`. This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws for each test case and handles inconsistencies appropriately.
