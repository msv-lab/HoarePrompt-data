### Reasoning:

1. **Test Cases Initialization**:
   - The program initializes `t` to 7 and defines a list `cas_de_test` containing predefined test cases. This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes `t` and `cas_de_test` as input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case `(p1, p2, p3)`, it calculates the total points (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It checks if the total points are even (`if total_points % 2 != 0`). If not, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an inconsistency. This check is correct.
   - It calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`). This calculation is correct.
   - It checks if the total number of matches exceeds 3 or if `p3` is greater than the total number of matches (`if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`). If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an inconsistency. However, this check is incorrect because the problem guarantees that `p1 \leq p2 \leq p3`, which means `p3` can be greater than `total_matchs` without being inconsistent. Therefore, this condition should be removed.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and then divides by 2 to get the number of draws (`egalites // 2`). This calculation is correct.
   - If the calculated number of draws is negative, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an inconsistency. This check is correct.
   - Otherwise, it appends the number of draws to the results.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results of each test case using `'\n'.join(map(str, resultats))`. This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

### Correctness:
- The original assessment incorrectly included the check `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`. Since the problem guarantees that `p1 \leq p2 \leq p3`, `p3` can be greater than `total_matchs` without being inconsistent. Therefore, this check should be removed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

Explanation: The original assessment included an incorrect check in the function `func_1` that unnecessarily restricts the possible values of `p3`. Removing this check will ensure the program correctly evaluates the maximum number of draws for each test case.
