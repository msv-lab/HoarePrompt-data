### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their respective wallets.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- Both players play optimally.
- The goal is to determine the winner based on the initial number of coins in their wallets.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)`, and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
- It then calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner.
- The result is stored in the `results` list.
- After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The original assessment states that the program does not correctly implement the game rules because it only checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` without simulating the actual game turns.
- Let's consider the example provided in the problem description:
  - Test Case: Alice has 1 coin, Bob has 4 coins.
  - According to the problem, if Alice and Bob play optimally, Alice will lose because she will eventually run out of coins to remove after swapping wallets with Bob.
  - However, the function `func_1(1, 4)` returns 'Alice' because `(1 + 4) % 2 != 0`.

This example clearly shows that the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and fails to handle the optimal play scenario, making it incorrect.
