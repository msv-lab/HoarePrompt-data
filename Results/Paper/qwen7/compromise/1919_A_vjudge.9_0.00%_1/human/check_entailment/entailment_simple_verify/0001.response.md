### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them, but after choosing, they must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game essentially boils down to the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If `a + b` is even, the first player (Alice) will always lose if both players play optimally. This is because:
     - After the first move (removing one coin), the total becomes odd.
     - The second player (Bob) can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that the total remains odd until the end.
     - When the total is odd, the second player (Bob) will always be able to make a valid move until the end, leaving the first player (Alice) without a valid move.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. If true, it returns 'Bob', otherwise 'Alice'.
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether the total number of coins is even or odd.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_2`. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not actually simulate the game; it only determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. This means that `func_1` does not account for the actual sequence of moves and the resulting state of the wallets during the game.

5. **Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:**
   - **Initial State:** `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - The function correctly returns 'Bob' if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` and 'Alice' otherwise.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1`.
     - However, the function does not simulate the actual game process. It simply determines the winner based on the initial parity of the total number of coins, which does not reflect the optimal strategy for the game.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the game mechanics. While the logic in `func_1` is correct for determining the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins, the function `func_2` does not simulate the actual game process. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not simulate the actual game process and only determines the winner based on the initial parity of the total number of coins.
