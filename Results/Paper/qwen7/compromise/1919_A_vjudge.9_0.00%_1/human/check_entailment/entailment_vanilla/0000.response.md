### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them, but after choosing, they must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game essentially boils down to the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If `a + b` is even, the first player (Alice) will always lose if both players play optimally. This is because:
     - After the first move (removing one coin), the total becomes odd.
     - The second player (Bob) can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that the total remains odd until the end.
     - When the total is odd, the second player (Bob) will always be able to make a valid move until the end, leaving the first player (Alice) without a valid move.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. If true, it returns 'Bob', otherwise 'Alice'.
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether the total number of coins is even or odd.
   - The function `func_2` correctly applies this logic to each test case and prints the results.

The given program correctly implements the solution based on the game mechanics and the provided problem description.
