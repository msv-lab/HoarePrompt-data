Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins they each have in their wallets. The key insight is that the game essentially boils down to whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd.
- The `func_1` function correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets:
  - If the sum is even, `func_1` returns 'Bob', indicating that Bob will win.
  - If the sum is odd, `func_1` returns 'Alice', indicating that Alice will win.
- The `func_2` function correctly processes multiple test cases by:
  - Reading the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, reading the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
  - Calling `func_1` with these values to determine the winner.
  - Collecting the results and printing them out.
- Given the problem statement and the execution summaries, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
