Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for result in results:`. The only object mentioned here is `result`, which is being iterated over from the list `results`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `results`**: The state before the loop starts is given as `results` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop execution**: For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. Since `results` is a list of `t` elements, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `results` is a valid list with at least one element for the loop to start executing. Additionally, since `result` is an element of `results`, we need to ensure that `result` is properly initialized or set to a value before the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `results` must be a list with at least one element.

**State:**
**`results` is a list of `t` elements, where `t` must be greater than 0**
