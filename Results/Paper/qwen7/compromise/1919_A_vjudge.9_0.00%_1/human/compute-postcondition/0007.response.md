Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and pairs of positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and potentially `t`.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing `t`, `a`, and `b`. It does not take any parameters itself but works with these values to produce a result for each test case.
