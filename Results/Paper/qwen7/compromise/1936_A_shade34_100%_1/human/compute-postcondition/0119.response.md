Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing 0, and `s` is the string input by the user, `s` is not equal to `<`, and if `s` is equal to '=', the postcondition remains as described in the if part. If `s` is not equal to '=', there is no change in the variables.
