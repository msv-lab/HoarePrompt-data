Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `pans`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `i` is 2
   - `pans` has at least 2 elements
   - If the input string is '>', then `mak` is 2; otherwise, the values of `i`, `pans`, and `mak` remain unchanged from the precondition.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be within the range defined by the `range` function, which is from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` should be 3 (as the loop increments `i` by 1 each time).
   - The condition `len(pans)` must still hold true, meaning `pans` must still have at least 2 elements.
   - The value of `mak` remains unchanged unless the input string is '>', but since no new information about the input string is provided, we assume it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 3, `pans` has at least 2 elements, and `mak` remains unchanged.**

Given the initial conditions and the loop range, the final answer is:

**State: `i` is 3, `pans` has at least 2 elements, and `mak` remains unchanged.**
