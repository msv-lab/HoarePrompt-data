Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head consists of the variable `i` and the range function arguments `1` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will start with `i = 1` and increment `i` until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Adjust the given states**:
   - The initial value of `mak` is 0, which is not directly related to the loop execution.
   - The variable `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), but this information is not relevant to the loop execution.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to start.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mak` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` must be greater than 1**
