Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.
- `n` must be greater than 2. Again, `n` is not used in the print statement, so its value does not affect the output.
- `i` is not defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement. Since no value for `i` is provided, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `i` is likely intended to be an index or a counter, but without further context, we can only say that it is an unspecified value.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `"?"` followed by the value of `mak` twice, and then the value of `i` twice. Since `mak` is 0, the output will include two zeros.

Output: **"? 0 0 [i] [i]" (where [i] is an unspecified value)**
