Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `mak2` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `pans` is an empty list.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `mak` is not directly mentioned in the initial state, but it seems to be a typo in the code snippet provided. It should likely be `mak2`.
   - `mak2` is explicitly given as `n-1`.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `mak2` is explicitly given as `n-1`.

4. **Substitute Values into Print Statement:**
   - Since `mak` is a typo and should be `mak2`, the print statement becomes `print('?', mak2, mak2, i, mak2)`.
   - Substituting the known values: `print('?', n-1, n-1, 0, n-1)`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak2`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` respectively.

Output: **'? n-1 n-1 0 n-1'**
