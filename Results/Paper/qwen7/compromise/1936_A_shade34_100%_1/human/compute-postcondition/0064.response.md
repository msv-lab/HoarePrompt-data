To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given code snippet and the initial state:

The code snippet is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

From the initial state, we don't have explicit values for `pans`, `mak`, or `i`. Therefore, we need to describe the output in terms of these variables.

1. `pans[mak]`: This is the element in the list `pans` at the index specified by `mak`.
2. `pans[i]`: This is the element in the list `pans` at the index specified by `i`.

The `print` statement includes a string `'?'` followed by the values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`, each repeated twice.

Given this, the output will be:
Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]'**
