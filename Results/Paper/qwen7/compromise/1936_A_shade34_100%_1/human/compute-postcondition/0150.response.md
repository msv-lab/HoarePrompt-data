Output State: **`i` is 1, `len(pans)` is at least 1, `pans` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, `s` is the last string input by the user, which is either '<' or '='.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the console. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `len(pans)`, `pans`, and `s` remain unchanged.
