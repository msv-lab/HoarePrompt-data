Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a test case defined by an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. Additionally, it works with a sequence `p_0, p_1, ..., p_{n-1}` which is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}. The function does not return any value explicitly but implies processing or validation of these inputs according to their constraints and relationships.**
