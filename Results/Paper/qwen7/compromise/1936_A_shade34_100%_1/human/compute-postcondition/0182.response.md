Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1 (though its exact value is not needed for the print statement).
- `i` is explicitly defined as 2.
- `mak` is explicitly defined as 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

This will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak` and `i`, repeated twice. Specifically, it will print:
- `'?'`
- The value of `mak`, which is 1
- The value of `mak` again, which is 1
- The value of `i`, which is 2
- The value of `i` again, which is 2

So, the output will be:
Output: **'? 1 1 2 2'**
