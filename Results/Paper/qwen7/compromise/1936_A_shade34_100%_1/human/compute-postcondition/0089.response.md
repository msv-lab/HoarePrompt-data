Output State: **`mak` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that any buffered data is written to the console immediately. However, since no variables are assigned or modified within this line of code, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
