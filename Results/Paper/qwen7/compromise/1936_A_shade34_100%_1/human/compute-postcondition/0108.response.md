Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, and `pans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `pans`. The values of `mak2`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `mak2` is still equal to `n-1`, `n` is still greater than 1, `i` is still `n`, and `pans` is now an empty list.
