Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `mak` is equal to `i - 1`.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed, but this does not affect the values of the variables directly.
   - A string read from input is either greater than '>' or the input operation completes without further changes to variables.
   - `len(pans)` must be greater than `i`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`.

Given the initial state:
- `mak` is `i - 1`.
- `pans` is a list, and its length is greater than `i`.

When the print statement executes, it will print:
- The character `'?'`.
- The value of `pans[mak]`, which is `pans[i - 1]`.
- The value of `pans[mak]` again, so it will be `pans[i - 1]`.
- The value of `pans[i]`.
- The value of `pans[i]` again.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [pans[i-1]] [pans[i-1]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]'**
