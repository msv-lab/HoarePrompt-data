Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing 1, `s` is the string input by the user.**

The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `pans`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `pans` now contains the value 1, while `i`, `n`, `mak2`, and `s` retain their original values.
