Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1 (though its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement).
- `i` is explicitly stated to be 3.
- `mak` is defined by the precondition but its explicit value is not given.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Given that `i` is 3, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` as the first argument.
- `mak` as the second and third arguments.
- `3` as the fourth and fifth arguments.

Since the exact value of `mak` is not specified, we will leave it as `mak`.

Output: **'? mak mak 3 3'**
