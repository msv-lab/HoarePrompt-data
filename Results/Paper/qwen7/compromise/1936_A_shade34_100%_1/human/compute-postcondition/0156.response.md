Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `len(pans)` is at least 1, meaning `pans` is a non-empty list.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Let's break down the components:

1. `'?'`: This is a string literal and will be printed as is.
2. `pans[mak]`: The value of `pans[mak]` is unknown because `mak` is not defined in the initial state.
3. `pans[i]`: Since `i` is explicitly given as 2, `pans[i]` refers to the third element in the list `pans`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the third element of the list `pans` twice.

Output: **'? [pans[2]] [pans[2]]' (where [pans[2]] is the third element of the list pans)**
