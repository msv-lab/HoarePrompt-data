Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `s` is an input string, `pans` is a list containing the integers 0 and 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `pans`. Initially, `pans` contains the integer 0. After appending, `pans` will contain both 0 and 1. The values of `i`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
