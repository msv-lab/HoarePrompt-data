Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `mak` is `n`.
   - `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1` and `i` or `[n-1, i, i]` depending on the value of `s`.
   - `s` is an input string.

2. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `mak` is `n`, `mak2` is also `n`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `pans` is `[n-1, i, i]` because `i` is repeated twice in the list, but since `pans` is not used in the print statement, we don't need to know the exact content of `pans`.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`.
   - This will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` in that order.

4. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - `'?'` remains as it is.
   - `mak` is `n`.
   - `mak2` is `n`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `mak2` is `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? n n n-1 n'**
