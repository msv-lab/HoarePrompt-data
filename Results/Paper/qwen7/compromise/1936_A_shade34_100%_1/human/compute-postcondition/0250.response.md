Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `pans`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments until it reaches `len(pans)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pans` has at least 2 elements.
   - If the input string is '>', then `mak` is 2; otherwise, the values of `i`, `pans`, and `mak` remain unchanged from the precondition.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3 (because the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration).
   - The condition `i < len(pans)` must still hold true for the loop to continue. Given that `pans` has at least 2 elements, `len(pans)` must be at least 2. Therefore, `i` being 3 is valid as long as `len(pans)` is at least 3.
   - The value of `pans` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `mak` remains unchanged unless the input string is '>', but since the condition for changing `mak` is not met (as `i` was 2 and now is 3), `mak` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` changes from 2 to 3.
   - `pans` remains unchanged.
   - `mak` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `pans` has at least 2 elements, and `mak` remains unchanged**.
