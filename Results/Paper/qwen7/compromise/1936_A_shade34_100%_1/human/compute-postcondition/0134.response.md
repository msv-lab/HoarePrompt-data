Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `mak2` is equal to `n-1`
   - `pans` is a list containing 1
   - `s` is the string input by the user, and it is either '<' or '='

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, after the increment in the loop, `i` will become 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is greater than 1, the loop will execute again as long as `n` remains greater than 1.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 1 (no change needed).
   - `mak2` will be updated to `n-1`.
   - `pans` remains a list containing 1 (no change needed).
   - `s` remains the string input by the user, either '<' or '=' (no change needed).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing 1, `s` is the string input by the user, if `s` is either '<' or '='**
