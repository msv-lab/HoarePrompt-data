Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 1.

3. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is at least 1, the condition `i < n` is satisfied, meaning the loop can execute again.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains at least 1 (since it was at least 1 before and no changes were made to it in the loop body).

5. **Other variables**:
   - `s`, `pans`, and `mak` are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition. Therefore, they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Based on this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `s` is a string, and `pans` is a list containing the integer 0. If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is also 0.**
