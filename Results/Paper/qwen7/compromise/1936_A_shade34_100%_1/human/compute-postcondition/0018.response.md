Output State: **`mak` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and `n` must be greater than 2.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or affect the conditions of the variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the console. However, since no variables are assigned or modified within this line of code, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
