Output State: **`mak` is 0, the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `s` is the last input received (either '<' or '='), and `pans` is a list containing all the indices `i` where `s` was equal to '<', with the last index added to `pans` being `n-1` if `s` was '='.**

This output state reflects that the variable `mak` has been initialized to 0, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions from the initial state.
