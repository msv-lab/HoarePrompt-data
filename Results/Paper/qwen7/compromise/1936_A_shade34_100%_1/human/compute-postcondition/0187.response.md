Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `mak` is either 2 (if the input string is equal to '<') or remains as per the precondition.

4. **Determine the Next Values**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` does not change based on the loop itself; it remains as per the precondition.
   - The value of `mak` does not affect the loop condition directly, so it remains as per the precondition.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
   - `n` remains as per the precondition (greater than 1).
   - `mak` remains as per the precondition.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, and `mak` is as per the precondition.**
