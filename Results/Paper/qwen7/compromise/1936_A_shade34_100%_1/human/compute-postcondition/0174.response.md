State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
- For the loop `for i in range(1, n):` to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the range function `range(1, n)` will not produce any values if `n` is less than or equal to 1.
- The variable `i` is initialized to 1 within the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` is set to 1.
