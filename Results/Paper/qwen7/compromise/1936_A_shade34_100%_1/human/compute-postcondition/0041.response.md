Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `s` is a string.
- `pans` is a list containing the integer 0.
- If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is also 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's break it down:

1. `mak` is defined as 0 if `s` is equal to '<'. Since no specific value for `s` is given other than it being a string, we assume the condition `s == '<'` does not hold unless explicitly stated otherwise. Therefore, `mak` remains 0.
2. `mak2` is not defined anywhere in the initial state, so it must be assumed to be undefined or not relevant to the print statement.
3. `i` is explicitly given as 1.
4. `mak2` is not defined, so it should be considered as not applicable or undefined.

Given this, the print statement will output the following:
Output: **'? 0 None 1 None'**
