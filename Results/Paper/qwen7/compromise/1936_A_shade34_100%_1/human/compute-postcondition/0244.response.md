Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] 2 pans[i]** 

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `i` is 2.
- `pans` is a list with at least 2 elements, but the values of `pans` and the indices `mak` are not explicitly given.
- Since `i` is 2, `pans[i]` refers to the third element of the list `pans`.
- The indices `mak` and `i` are used in the print statement, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, they are left as `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.

Given this, the print statement will output a string followed by the values of `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `2`, and `pans[i]`.
