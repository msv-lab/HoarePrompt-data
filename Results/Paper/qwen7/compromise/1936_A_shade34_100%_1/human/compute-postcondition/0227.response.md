Output State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is a list containing the element `i`, `s` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `pans = [i]` updates the list `pans` to contain only the element `i`. The value of `i` is `n-1` based on the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
