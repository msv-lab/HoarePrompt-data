Postcondition: **`mak` is equal to `i`, a string read from input is either greater than '>', or the input operation completes without further changes to variables, `len(pans)` must be greater than `i`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the input string is '>' or not, `mak` will be equal to `i`, and the other conditions specified in the precondition will still hold true.
