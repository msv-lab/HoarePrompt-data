Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is at least 1 (this means `n >= 1`).
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `pans` is a list containing either the integer 0 or the integers 0 and 1. If `s` equals '<', `pans` will contain the integer 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 1 (i.e., `n > 1`).

5. **Keep other states unchanged**:
   - The state of `s` and `pans` remains the same because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pans` is a list containing either the integer 0 or the integers 0 and 1. If `s` equals '<', `pans` will contain the integer 1.**
