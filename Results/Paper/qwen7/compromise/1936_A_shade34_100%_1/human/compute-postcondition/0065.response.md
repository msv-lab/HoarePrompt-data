Output State: **`sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function is called, which flushes the internal buffer of the standard output stream, ensuring that all previously written output is actually sent to the terminal or file. However, since no variables are assigned or modified by this function call, the initial state remains unchanged.
