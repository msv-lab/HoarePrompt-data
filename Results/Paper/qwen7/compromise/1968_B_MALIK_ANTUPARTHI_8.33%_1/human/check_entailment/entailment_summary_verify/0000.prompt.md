You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (with \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \)), and two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \) (of lengths \( n \) and \( m \) respectively). For each character in string \( a \), it finds the position in string \( b \) where the character first appears, and returns the position of the last character of \( a \) in \( b \) or the position where the character would appear if it were not found, ensuring the returned value is within the bounds of \( b \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum prefix length of string `a` that is a subsequence of string `b`. Specifically, the program uses `e.index(d[j]) + 1` to find the next occurrence of `d[j]` in the remaining part of `e`, but this approach does not guarantee that the found index corresponds to the next character in the subsequence. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
2
5 4
10011
1110
3 5
100
11010
```
- Expected Output:
```
2
3
```
- Actual Output:
```
2
3
```

However, for the second test case, the expected output should be `3` because the prefix "100" of string `a` is indeed a subsequence of string `b`. The program correctly identifies this, but it fails to handle cases where the prefix length is exactly equal to the length of `a`. In the given implementation, if the entire string `a` forms a subsequence of `b`, the program might prematurely terminate the loop, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program should continue checking the remaining characters in `b` after finding a match, ensuring that the entire prefix of `a` is checked against `b`.
