Output State: **`b` is an integer input, `c` is an integer input**.

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `b` and `c` respectively. The values of other variables (`i`, `a`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
