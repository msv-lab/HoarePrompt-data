Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `a` iterations, and `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. After `a` iterations, `i` will be equal to `a`.

3. **Determine the New State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the previous value of `i` plus the total number of iterations the loop executed, which means `i` is now `a`.
   - `a` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
   - `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged from their previous values.
   - `j` is set to `b`.
   - `k` is determined based on the conditions given:
     - If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then `k` is set to the position in string `e` where `d[b-1]` is found plus one.
     - Otherwise, `k` is set to `b`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `i` is now `a`.
- `a` remains the same.
- `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged.
- `j` is set to `b`.
- `k` is either `b` or the position in string `e` where `d[b-1]` is found plus one, provided that either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. If neither condition is met, `k` is set to `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is `a`, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is the same as its previous value, `c` is the same as its previous value, `d` is the same as its previous value, `e` is the same as its previous value, `j` is `b`, and `k` is either `b` or the position in string `e` where `d[b-1]` is found plus one, provided that either `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`. If neither condition is met, `k` is set to `b`.**
