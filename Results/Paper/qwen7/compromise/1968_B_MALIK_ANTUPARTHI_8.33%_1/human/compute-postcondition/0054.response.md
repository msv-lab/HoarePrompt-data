Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 0, `k` is 0**.

The code `k = j` assigns the value of `j` (which is 0) to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
