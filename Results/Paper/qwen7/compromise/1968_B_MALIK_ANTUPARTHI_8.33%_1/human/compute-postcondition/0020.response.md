Output State: **`d` is a list, `j` is an index within the range of `d` that is `j + 1` (if `j < b - 1`), `e` is a list, `k` is the index of `d[j]` in list `e` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `k = e.index(d[j]) + 1` finds the index of `d[j]` in list `e` and adds 1 to it. This value is stored in `k`. The values of `d`, `j`, and `e` remain unchanged from their initial states.
