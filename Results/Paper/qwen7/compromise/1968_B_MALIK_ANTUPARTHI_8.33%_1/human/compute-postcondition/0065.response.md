Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 2, `k` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the only effect is that the program will exit the implied loop or condition. All other variables retain their initial states.
