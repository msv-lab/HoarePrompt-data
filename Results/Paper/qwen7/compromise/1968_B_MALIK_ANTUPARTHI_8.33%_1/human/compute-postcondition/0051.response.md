Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 1, `k` is `j` + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. The values of `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the program will exit the current loop or conditional structure.
