Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` is 0, `b` is the first integer input after splitting, `c` is the second integer input after splitting, `d` is an input string, `e` is a string input from the user.**

The code `e = input()` assigns the value of the string input from the user to the variable `e`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
