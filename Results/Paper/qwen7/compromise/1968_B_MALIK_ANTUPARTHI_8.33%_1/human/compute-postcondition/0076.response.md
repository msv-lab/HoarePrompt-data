Postcondition: `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is an integer input from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is 3, and `k` is either 3 or 4 depending on whether `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, and in both cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
