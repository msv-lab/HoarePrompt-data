Output State: **`d` is a list, `j` is an index such that `j + 1` if `j < b - 1`, `e` is a list, `k` is `j + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `d`, `j`, `e`, or `k`. It only indicates that the execution will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the break statement is noted as having been executed.
