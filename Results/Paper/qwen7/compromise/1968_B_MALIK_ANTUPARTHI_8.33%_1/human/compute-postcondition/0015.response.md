Output State: **`d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is equal to `j`, and all other variables retain their values from the precondition.**

This means that the value of `k` has been updated to be equal to `j`, while the condition `d[j] is not in e[k:]` remains unchanged, and all other variables retain their original values from the initial state.
