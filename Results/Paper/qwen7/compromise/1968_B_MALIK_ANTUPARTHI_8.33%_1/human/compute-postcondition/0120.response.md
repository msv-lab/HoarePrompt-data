Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2. If `d[2]` is found in the sublist `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to `e.index(d[2]) + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `d[2]` is not found in the sublist `e[k:]`, `k` remains 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
