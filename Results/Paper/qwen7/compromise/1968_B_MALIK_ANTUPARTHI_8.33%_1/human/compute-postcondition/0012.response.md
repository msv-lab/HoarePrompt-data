Postcondition: `d` is a list, `j` is an index within the range of `d`, `e` is a list, and if the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` holds true, the current value of `d[j]` remains unchanged and is still present at index `k` in the sublist of `e` starting from index `k` to the end of the list. If the condition does not hold, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
