Postcondition: `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1, `a` is the same as its previous value, `b` is an integer input from the user, `c` is an integer input from the user, `d` is the input string from the user, `e` is a string input from the user, `j` is either 1 or 0, `k` is either `j` + 1 or 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1` or if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`.
