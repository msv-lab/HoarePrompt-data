Postcondition: `b` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `k` is either 1 (if the condition `k == c` or `j == b - 1` is true, breaking out of the loop), or `k` is `e.index(d[0]) + 1` (if the condition is false). If the if condition is not met, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
