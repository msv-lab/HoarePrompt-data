Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n-1]`, `k` is `0`, `ans` is `a[0]`, `res` is `n - 1`, `ans_list` contains the value of `a[0]`, `a` is sorted list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
    if dif == 0:
        res -= 1
    if dif != 0:
        if k >= dif * (i + 1):
            ans += dif
            k -= dif * (i + 1)
            res -= 1
        else:
            ans += k // (i + 1)
            if i != 0:
                res += k % (i + 1)
            k = 0
            break
        if k == 0:
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `dif` is not 0, and `res` remains -1 if `k` is 0 and `ans` is 0, or -2 if `k` is greater than or equal to `dif` * (0 + 1).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is not equal to 0, the most internal loop or if statement is not executed, so `res` remains -2, and `ans` retains its original value. If `dif` equals 0, `res` is set to -2, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `res` is -3, `ans` retains its original value, and `k` is 0, since the condition `dif != 0` is true and the block inside the if statement is executed, leading to no changes in the values of the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
