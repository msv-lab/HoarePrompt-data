Output State: **`i` is n-1, `dif` is a[n] - a[n-1], `k` is 0, `ans` is the sum of differences where the condition `k >= dif * (i + 1)` was met plus `k // n`, and `res` is -n.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `k // n`. Given that `k` is 0 initially, `k // n` is also 0. Therefore, `ans` remains unchanged from its previous value. All other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, and `res`) remain as they were in the initial state.
