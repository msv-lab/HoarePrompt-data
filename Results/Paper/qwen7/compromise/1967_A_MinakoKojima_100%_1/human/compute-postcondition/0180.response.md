Output State: **`i` is 0; `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initially 0. The code calculates the difference between the element at index `i + 1` (which is `a[1]`) and the element at index `i` (which is `a[0]`). This difference is then assigned to the variable `dif`. Since `i` remains unchanged, it is still 0. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `dif` and the unchanged value of `i`.
