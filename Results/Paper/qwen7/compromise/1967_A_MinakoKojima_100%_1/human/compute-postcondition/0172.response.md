The code appends the value of `ans` to `ans_list`. Since `ans` is defined as `2*a[0] + k // n - (n - 1) + (-n + k % n)` and given that `k` is `0`, the expression simplifies to `2*a[0] - (n - 1) + (-n + 0) = 2*a[0] - 2*n + 1`. However, since `a` is not defined in the initial state and no value for `a[0]` is provided, we cannot simplify further without additional information. But we know that `ans` is now added to `ans_list`.

The states of the other variables (`dif`, `res`, `k`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans_list` contains `2*a[0] - 2*n + 1`, `dif` is `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, `res` is `-n + k % n`, `k` is `0`, `i` is `n-1**
