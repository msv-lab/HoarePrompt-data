Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is 0, `ans` is `k // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `k = 0` updates the value of `k` to 0. Since `res` is updated to -1 only when `i` is not equal to 0, and the initial state shows `i` is 1, the condition `i != 0` is true, causing `res` to be updated to -1. However, since the code simply assigns `k` to 0, the value of `res` changes from its initial value of -1 to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
