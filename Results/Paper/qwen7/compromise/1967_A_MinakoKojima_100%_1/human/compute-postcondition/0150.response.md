Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `res` is -2, `k` is `k - (a[3] - a[2]) * 3**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is 2, so `dif` is calculated as `a[3] - a[2]`. The value of `res` remains -2. The variable `k` is updated by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)` from its current value, which results in `k` becoming `k - (a[3] - a[2]) * 3`.
