Output State: **`i` is 3, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `res` is `res + k % (i + 1)`, `k` is 0, `ans` is `ans + 0`, `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the variables `i`, `dif`, `res`, `k`, and `ans` were being updated. Since the `break` statement does not modify these variables, their values remain unchanged. We also note that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
