Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `res` is -3, `ans` retains its original value, and `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block was specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `dif`, `res`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
