Postcondition: `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * (i + 1)`, then `k` is reduced by `dif * (i + 1)`, `res` is reduced by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by `k // (i + 1)`, `res` is increased by `k % (i + 1)`, `k` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
