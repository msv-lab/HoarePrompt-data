Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `res` is -3.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since the condition `k >= dif * (i + 1)` was not met (as `k` is either `-dif * 3` or 0 and `i` is 2), the values of `k`, `ans`, and `res` remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `res` remains -3.
