`n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which converts the input into integers. The values of `ans_list`, `dif`, `res`, `k`, `i`, and `num_iterations` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `ans_list` contains `2*a[0] - 2*n + 1`, `dif` is `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`, `res` is `-n + k % n`, `k` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `new_num_iterations`.
