Output State: **`i` is 2; `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`; `k` is `k - dif * (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The variable `k` is updated by subtracting `dif * (i + 1)` from its current value. Since `i` was initially 1, `i + 1` is 2, and `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, the new value of `k` is `k - (a[2] - a[1]) * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
