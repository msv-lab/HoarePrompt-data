Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is -3, `k` is `k - (a[2] - a[1]) * 2**.

Explanation: The variable `res` is initially `-2`. After executing `res -= 1`, `res` is decremented by 1, resulting in `res` being `-3`. The other variables (`i`, `dif`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
