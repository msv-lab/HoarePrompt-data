Output State: **`i` is 2, `dif` is `a[i + 1] - a[i]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, `res` is -3**.

Explanation: The code `k = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `k`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `dif`, `ans`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
