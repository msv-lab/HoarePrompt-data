Output State: **`i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `res` is 0, `ans` is `k // 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `dif`, `res`, and `ans`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
