Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we need to set `i` to 0.
   - The condition for the loop to execute is that `i` should be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1` initially.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to 0.
- `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

The other variables (`ans_list`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, and `res`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `i` must be less than `n - 1`**
