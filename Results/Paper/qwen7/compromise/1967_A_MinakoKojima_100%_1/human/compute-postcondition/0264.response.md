Output State: `ans_list` contains the sum of `a[0]` repeated `n` times plus the total reduction in `res` over all iterations, adjusted by the final value of `res` and the final value of `ans`.

To explain further, after all iterations of the loop, the list `ans_list` will contain the final computed value of `ans` for each iteration. The value of `ans` is calculated based on sorting the list `a`, then iteratively adjusting it based on the differences between consecutive elements and the value of `k`. After all iterations, `ans` is further adjusted by adding `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` and the final value of `res`. The `res` variable keeps track of remaining reductions that couldn't be fully applied due to insufficient `k` values, which gets added to `ans` at the end.
