Output State: **`i` is n-1, `dif` is a[n] - a[n-1], `k` is 0, `ans` is ans * (n - 1), and `res` is -n.**

Explanation: The line `ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)` updates the value of `ans` by adding `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` to its current value. Since `ans` was previously defined as the sum of differences where the condition `k >= dif * (i + 1)` was met plus `k // n`, and now it is updated to `ans * (n - 1)`. All other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
