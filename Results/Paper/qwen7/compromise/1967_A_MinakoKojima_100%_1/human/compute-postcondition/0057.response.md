Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`
   - `k` is 0
   - `ans` is 0
   - `res` is either -2 or -1, based on whether `dif` is not equal to 0 or not.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(n - 1)`, the variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Consider the Postconditions**:
   - The values of `dif`, `k`, `ans`, and `res` are not directly affected by the loop itself but rather by the loop body. These values will be determined by the loop body execution, which is not specified here. However, since the question asks to adjust the states based on the loop head, these values remain unchanged.

Given the above reasoning, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be the same as before, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `k` is 0, `ans` is 0, and `res` is either -2 or -1**.
