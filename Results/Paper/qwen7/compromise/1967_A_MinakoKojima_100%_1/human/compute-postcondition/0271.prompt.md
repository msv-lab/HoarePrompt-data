Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ans_list` contains the sum of `a[0]` repeated `n` times plus the total reduction in `res` over all iterations, adjusted by the final value of `res` and the final value of `ans`.

To explain further, after all iterations of the loop, the list `ans_list` will contain the final computed value of `ans` for each iteration. The value of `ans` is calculated based on sorting the list `a`, then iteratively adjusting it based on the differences between consecutive elements and the value of `k`. After all iterations, `ans` is further adjusted by adding `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` and the final value of `res`. The `res` variable keeps track of remaining reductions that couldn't be fully applied due to insufficient `k` values, which gets added to `ans` at the end.
Code of the loop:
for a in ans_list:
    print(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans_list` must contain at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans_list` must contain at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans_list` must contain at least one element




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
