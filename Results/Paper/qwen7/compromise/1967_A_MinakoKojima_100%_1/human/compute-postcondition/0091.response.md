Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `dif` is `a[n] - a[n-1]`, `k` is `0`, `ans` is `ans * (n - 1) - n`, `res` is `-n`, `ans_list` contains the value of `ans`, `a` is sorted list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, `ans`, `res`, `ans_list`, `n`, `k`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `a` is now sorted.
