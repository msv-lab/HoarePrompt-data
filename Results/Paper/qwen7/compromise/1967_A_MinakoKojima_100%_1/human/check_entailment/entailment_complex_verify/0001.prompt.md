You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: Output State: `ans_list` contains the sum of `a[0]` repeated `n` times plus the total reduction in `res` over all iterations, adjusted by the final value of `res` and the final value of `ans`.
    #
    #To explain further, after all iterations of the loop, the list `ans_list` will contain the final computed value of `ans` for each iteration. The value of `ans` is calculated based on sorting the list `a`, then iteratively adjusting it based on the differences between consecutive elements and the value of `k`. After all iterations, `ans` is further adjusted by adding `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` and the final value of `res`. The `res` variable keeps track of remaining reductions that couldn't be fully applied due to insufficient `k` values, which gets added to `ans` at the end.

    #State: Output State: `ans_list` will contain the final computed value of `ans` for each iteration after all iterations of the loop have finished. This value is determined by sorting the list `a`, then iteratively adjusting it based on the differences between consecutive elements and the value of `k`. After all iterations, `ans` is further adjusted by adding `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` and the final value of `res`. The `res` variable keeps track of remaining reductions that couldn't be fully applied due to insufficient `k` values, which gets added to `ans` at the end.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations means that `ans_list` will hold the final adjusted value of `ans` for each input list `a` after the loop has completed all its intended iterations. This final value of `ans` is derived from the sorted list `a`, with adjustments made during each iteration based on the differences between consecutive elements and the value of `k`. After processing all elements, any remaining reductions stored in `res` are also added to `ans`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer \( t \), two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). For each test case, it sorts the list \( a \), then iteratively adjusts the first element of the list based on the differences between consecutive elements and the value of \( k \). After all adjustments, it calculates a final value for the first element of the list, which is influenced by the remaining value of \( k \) and the number of elements in the list. The function outputs the final value for each test case and returns a list containing these values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list `a` representing the counts of each type of card.
   
2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted. This step is necessary to facilitate the subsequent calculations.

3. **Initialization**:
   - `ans` is initialized to `a[0]`. This seems to be an attempt to accumulate the maximum number of cards that can be used to form permutations.
   - `res` is initialized to `n - 1`. This likely represents the remaining slots after accounting for the initial card count.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates through the sorted list `a` to calculate how many additional cards can be used to form permutations.
   - For each pair of consecutive elements in `a`, the difference (`dif`) is calculated.
   - If `dif` is zero, it means there are no gaps between the current and next type of card, so `res` is decremented.
   - If `dif` is non-zero, the program checks if `k` (remaining coins) is sufficient to bridge the gap. If so, it updates `ans` and `k` accordingly.
   - If `k` is not sufficient, it calculates the maximum number of cards that can be added and updates `ans` and `k`.

5. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After the loop, any remaining `k` coins are distributed among the remaining cards.
   - The formula `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` is used, which seems to be an attempt to account for additional permutations formed by the remaining cards.

6. **Output**:
   - The results are stored in `ans_list` and printed at the end.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Permutations**:
   - The formula `(ans - 1) * (n - 1)` is not correctly calculating the number of permutations. The correct approach should involve dynamic programming or a more sophisticated method to count valid permutations.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the distribution of cards might not allow forming the required permutations efficiently.

3. **Complexity**:
   - The solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, but the logic for counting permutations is flawed.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
