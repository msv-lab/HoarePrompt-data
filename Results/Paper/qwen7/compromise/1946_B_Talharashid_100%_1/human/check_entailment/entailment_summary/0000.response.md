Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the optimal strategy is to repeatedly add the largest possible sums to the array. If we can make the array consist entirely of positive numbers, the sum will be maximized.
3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code iterates through the array to calculate a value `maxi`, which is the maximum cumulative sum `c` under certain conditions (resetting `c` when encountering negative elements whose absolute value is less than or equal to `c`).
   - This approach seems to be trying to find the largest possible prefix sum of the array.
   - The formula \((2^k \cdot maxi - maxi + sum(a)) \mod 1000000007\) is used to compute the final result. This formula suggests that the sum is being amplified by \(2^k\) and then adjusted by subtracting `maxi` and adding the original sum of the array.
4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating `maxi` appears to be correct for finding the largest prefix sum under the given conditions.
   - The formula \((2^k \cdot maxi - maxi + sum(a)) \mod 1000000007\) seems to be a valid way to maximize the sum after `k` operations. The term \(2^k \cdot maxi\) amplifies the largest possible sum, and the subtraction of `maxi` and addition of the original sum ensure the result is correctly adjusted.
   - The implementation handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
