Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements (one less than before), `maxi` is the maximum value between `c + ele` and the current `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`. The length of the list `l` decreases by one because it has at least 2 elements and one less than before. The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum between the new value of `c` (which is `c + ele`) and the current value of `maxi`. The variable `ele` remains as the next element in the list `l`.
