Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and the sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(-10^9 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). `c` is the final cumulative value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop for all iterations. `maxi` is the maximum value obtained during the iterations, specifically the maximum of `c` and `maxi` after processing all elements in the list `l`. The final output is calculated as \((2^k \cdot maxi - maxi + sum(l)) \mod 1000000007\).

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `maxi` will contain the maximum value of `c` across all iterations, and the final output will be computed using this `maxi`, the given `k`, and the sum of the list `l`.
