Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to int.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function, which then creates a list of these integers. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
