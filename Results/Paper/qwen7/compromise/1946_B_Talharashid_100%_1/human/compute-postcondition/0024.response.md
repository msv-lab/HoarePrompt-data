Output State: **`c` is the sum of its previous value and `ele`, and `ele` retains its original value.**

This means that the variable `c` has been updated to include the value of `ele`, but `ele` itself remains unchanged from its previous state. The exact numerical value of `c` depends on its previous value and the current value of `ele`.
