Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
   - `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
   - `l` is an empty list.
   - `c` is the final cumulative value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop.
   - `maxi` is the maximum value between the original `maxi` and the value of `c` when `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)` is false, or 0 when it is true.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, if the loop has just completed its previous iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains unchanged as it is determined by the user input before the loop starts.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `int(input())` remains the same as it is determined by the user input before the loop starts.

Since the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi` are not directly affected by the loop head, they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is an empty list, `c` is the final cumulative value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `maxi` is the maximum value between the original `maxi` and the value of `c` when `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)` is false, or 0 when it is true, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `int(input())` remains the same.**
