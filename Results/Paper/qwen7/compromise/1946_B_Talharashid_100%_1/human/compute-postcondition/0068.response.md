Output State: **`maxi` is updated to the maximum value between the current `c` and `maxi`, `i` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the value of the first integer input, `k` is the value of the second integer input, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `c` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `maxi`, `i`, `n`, `k`, or `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only new information is that `c` is now set to 0.
