Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for ele in l:`. The objects involved here are `ele`, `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `ele` is the variable used to iterate over each element in `l`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements left in the list `l`. Therefore, the loop will start if `l` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, we need to ensure that `l` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `ele` will take the value of each element in `l` during each iteration, but we don't need to specify its initial value because it will be set by the loop itself.

5. **Consider other given variables**:
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - `i` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration (not relevant for the current loop).
   - `n` is the value of the first integer input (not relevant for the current loop).
   - `k` is the value of the second integer input (not relevant for the current loop).
   - `c` is 0 (not relevant for the current loop).

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the list `l` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element**
