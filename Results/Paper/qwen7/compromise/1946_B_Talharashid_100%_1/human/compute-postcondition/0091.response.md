Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements (one less than before), `maxi` is the maximum value between `c + ele` and the current `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`. The value of `ele` remains the next element in the list `l`, and the length of the list `l` decreases by one. The initial conditions about `l` having at least 2 elements and `maxi` being the maximum value between `c + ele` and the current `maxi` remain valid.
