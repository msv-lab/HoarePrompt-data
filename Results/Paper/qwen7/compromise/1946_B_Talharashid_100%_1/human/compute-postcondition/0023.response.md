Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `c` is 0**

Explanation: The initial state was that `maxi` was the maximum of `c` and `maxi`. After executing `c = 0`, the value of `c` is set to 0. Since `maxi` was previously the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and now `c` is 0, `maxi` must also be 0 (assuming `maxi` was not already 0 or less than 0 before). Therefore, both `maxi` and `c` are 0.
