Output State: **`l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c + ele` and the current `maxi`, `ele` is the next element in the list `l`, `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and the previous `maxi`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxi` to be the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`. The list `l` and the variable `ele` remain unchanged from their initial state.
