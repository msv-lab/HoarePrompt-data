Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    maxi = 0
    for ele in l:
        if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
            c = 0
        else:
            c += ele
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
    maxi = max(c, maxi)
    print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `k` is an integer from the input split by space and converted to int, `l` is an empty list, `c` is the final cumulative value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, and `maxi` is the maximum value between the original `maxi` and the value of `c` when `ele < 0` and `c <= abs(ele)` is false, or 0 when it is true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between the current `c` and `maxi`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
