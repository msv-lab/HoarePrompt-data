Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers with at least one element, `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`. If there exists an element `ele` in `l` such that `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is now 0, then `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`. Otherwise, for each element `ele` in `l`, if `ele` is greater than or equal to 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`, `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and the current `maxi`.
