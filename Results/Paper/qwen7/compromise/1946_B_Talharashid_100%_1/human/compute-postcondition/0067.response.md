Output State: **`maxi` is updated to the maximum value between the current `c` and `maxi`, `i` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration, `n` is the value of the first integer input, `k` is the value of the second integer input, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `l`. The values of `maxi`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
