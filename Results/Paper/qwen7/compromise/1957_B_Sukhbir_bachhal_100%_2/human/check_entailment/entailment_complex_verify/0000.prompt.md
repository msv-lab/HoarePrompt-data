You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, with n not equal to 0. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `position` is the number of times `n` can be right-shifted until it becomes 0, `n` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to right-shift `n` by 1 bit until `n` becomes 0. The variable `position` keeps track of how many times the loop has executed, which is equivalent to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`. Therefore, once `n` becomes 0, the loop terminates, and `position` will be the total number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `n`.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns a value that is one less than the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `t`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and returns -1 if `n` is 0. Otherwise, it returns a value that is one less than the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence for certain inputs. 

Consider the test case `n=3` and `k=3`. According to the problem description, the optimal solution would be `[1, 1, 1]`, which gives a bitwise OR result of `111_2` (7 in decimal), maximizing the number of 1s. However, the current implementation will generate `[2, 1, 0]` or similar sequences, which do not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR result. For instance, if `n=3` and `k=3`, the program outputs `[2, 1, 0]`, but the bitwise OR of `[1, 1, 1]` is `111_2` (7), whereas the bitwise OR of `[2, 1, 0]` is `110_2` (6), which is not optimal.
