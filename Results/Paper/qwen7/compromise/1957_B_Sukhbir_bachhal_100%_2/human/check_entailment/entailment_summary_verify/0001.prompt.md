You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `n` and returns -1 if `n` is 0. Otherwise, it returns a value that is one less than the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - If `n > 1`, the program constructs a sequence as follows:
     - It calls `func_1(k)` to get the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This function returns the position of the highest set bit in the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
     - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the array `arr`. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the `counter`-th bit.
     - It appends `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to the array `arr`. This ensures the sum of the array is `k`.
     - It fills the rest of the array with zeros.
     - Finally, it prints the constructed array.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds the position of the highest set bit in the binary representation of `k` and returns the position minus 1.
   - It works correctly by right-shifting `n` until it becomes zero, counting the shifts.

### Testing the Program:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `1 5`
- Expected Output: `5`
- Explanation: Since `n = 1`, the program directly prints `k = 5`.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `2 3`
- Expected Output: `1 2`
- Explanation: `2 ** 1 - 1 = 1` and `3 - 1 = 2`. The sequence `[1, 2]` sums to `3` and the bitwise OR is `1 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), which is correct.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `2 5`
- Expected Output: `5 0`
- Explanation: `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3` but since `n = 2`, we use `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3` and `5 - 3 = 2`. The sequence `[5, 0]` sums to `5` and the bitwise OR is `5 | 0 = 5` (binary `101`), which is correct.

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `6 51`
- Expected Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12`
- Explanation: The sequence `[3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]` sums to `51` and the bitwise OR is `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 101111` (binary), which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program is correct.
