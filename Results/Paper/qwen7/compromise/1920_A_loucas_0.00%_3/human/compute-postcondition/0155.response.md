Output State: **`max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is equal to `num`, `num` is equal to `i`.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `num`. Since `i` was not in `no` in the initial state, and no other changes were made to `i` or `no`, the condition `i` is not in `no` remains true. The output state updates `num` to be equal to `i`, maintaining the initial condition that `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`.
