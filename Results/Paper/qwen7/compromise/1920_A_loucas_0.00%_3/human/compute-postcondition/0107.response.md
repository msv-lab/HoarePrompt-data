Postcondition: `i` is an integer that is within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`. If `i` is not in the set `no`, then `i` is equal to `num` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in the set `no`, no specific changes are made to `num` and we do not break out of the loop or if statement.
