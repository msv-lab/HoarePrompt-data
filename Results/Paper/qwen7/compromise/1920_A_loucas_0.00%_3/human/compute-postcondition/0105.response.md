Output State: **`i` is an integer that is within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`, `num` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `num`. Therefore, the values of `i` and `num` remain the same as they were in the initial state, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
