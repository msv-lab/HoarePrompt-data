Output State: **`i` is `max(big) + 1`; `num` is `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is assigned the value of `i`. The initial state of `i` is `max(big) + 1`, and since no other operations are performed on `i`, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `max(big) + 1`, and `num` now holds the value of `i`.
