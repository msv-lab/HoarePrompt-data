Output State: **`i` is an integer, `no` is a set of integers, and `num` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement in the given code, the variables `i`, `no`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
