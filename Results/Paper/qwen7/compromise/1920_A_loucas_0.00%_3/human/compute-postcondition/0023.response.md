Output State: **`iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is an input integer, `big` now contains the value of `a`. The values of `iterable2` and `x` remain unchanged.
