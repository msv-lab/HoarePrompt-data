Output State: **`iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer with the current value of 1, `a` is appended to the list `big`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is an input integer, its value is not specified here, but it is added to the list `big`. The values of `iterable2` and `x` remain unchanged.
