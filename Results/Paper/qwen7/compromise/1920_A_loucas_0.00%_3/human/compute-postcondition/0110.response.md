Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `num` is `i + 1`; `max(big)` is the same; `min(less)` is the same and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `num`, `max(big)`, or `min(less)`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional statement is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one.
