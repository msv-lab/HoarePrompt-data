Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` is an input integer, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is an empty list, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a`, `x` is either equal to 1 or not equal to 1, `a` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a`, `x` is either equal to 1 or not equal to 1, `a` is an integer, `x` is an integer. If `x` is 1, `big` becomes a list containing `a`. If `x` is 2, `less` becomes a list containing `a`. Otherwise, `no` becomes a list containing the value of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is either a list containing `a` or an empty list, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a`, `x` is an integer equal to the first input integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
