Output State: **`i` is an integer that is within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`, `num` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`, this range remains unchanged. The value of `num` is now the same as `i`, but the initial conditions regarding the range of `i` are preserved.
