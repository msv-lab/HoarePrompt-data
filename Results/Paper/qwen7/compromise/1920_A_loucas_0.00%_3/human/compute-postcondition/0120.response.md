Output State: **`num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` is an input integer, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `innerLoop = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `innerLoop`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
