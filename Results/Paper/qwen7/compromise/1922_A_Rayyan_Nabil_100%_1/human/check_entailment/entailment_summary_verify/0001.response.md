### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that both strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not.
   - A template `t` can have lowercase or uppercase letters. If a letter in `t` is lowercase, the corresponding letter in `a`, `b`, or `c` must match. If a letter in `t` is uppercase, the corresponding letter in `a`, `b`, or `c` must not match.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` currently checks if for every character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `c[i]`.
   - This is a necessary but not sufficient condition. It ensures that `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same position, but it does not guarantee that a valid template exists where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` for each.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` needs to be modified to correctly determine if a valid template exists. Specifically, it should check if there is a way to assign lowercase and uppercase characters to `t` such that `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` only checks for a simple condition and does not explore all possible combinations of lowercase and uppercase characters in `t`.

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary for `func_2` correctly describes its behavior. It reads multiple test cases, processes each one using `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - However, the function summary does not provide information about the correctness of `func_1`.

6. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if a valid template exists.
   - The original assessment also correctly concludes that the given program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately identifies the issue with `func_1` and correctly concludes that the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if a valid template exists.
