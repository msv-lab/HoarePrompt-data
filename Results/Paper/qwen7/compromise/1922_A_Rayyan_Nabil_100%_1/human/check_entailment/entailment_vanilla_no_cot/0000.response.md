Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution only checks if there exists at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`. However, this is not sufficient to determine if there exists a template that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c`. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that:
1. Both `a` and `b` match the template.
2. `c` does not match the template.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    # Check if a and b can match the same template and c cannot
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i].islower() and b[i].islower() and a[i] == c[i]:
            return 'NO'
        if a[i].isupper() and b[i].isupper() and a[i].lower() == c[i]:
            return 'NO'
        if a[i].islower() and b[i].isupper() and a[i] == c[i]:
            return 'NO'
        if a[i].isupper() and b[i].islower() and a[i].lower() == c[i]:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Call the function to run the tests
func_2()
```

This code checks each character position to ensure that:
- If both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are lowercase and equal to `c[i]`, then `c` cannot match the template.
- If both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are uppercase and their lowercase versions are equal to `c[i]`, then `c` cannot match the template.
- If `a[i]` is lowercase and `b[i]` is uppercase with their lowercase versions being equal to `c[i]`, then `c` cannot match the template.
- If `a[i]` is uppercase and `b[i]` is lowercase with their lowercase versions being equal to `c[i]`, then `c` cannot match the template.

If none of these conditions are met, it means that both `a` and `b` can match the same template while `c` cannot, and thus the function returns 'YES'.
