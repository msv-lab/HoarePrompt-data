You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: Output State: The value returned by the function is either 'YES' or None (if the loop completes without encountering any condition where `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` for any `i`).
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the return value of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the corresponding iteration. `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, and for each iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, while `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The output state will be the same as the initial state because the loop simply iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. The `results` list remains unchanged after the loop executes all the iterations.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It checks if for any position `i`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both different from `c[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that there exists a valid template `t` where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- Expected Output:
```
NO
```

However, the current implementation would incorrectly output "YES" because `a[0]` (which is 'a') and `b[0]` (which is 'b') are different from `c[0]` (which is 'a'), and `a[1]` (which is 'a') and `b[1]` (which is 'b') are different from `c[1]` (which is 'b'). This means both `a` and `b` could potentially match a template where all letters are the same, which is not the intended behavior.

The correct approach would involve checking for each position if either `a[i]` or `b[i]` can be the same as `c[i]` in a template, while ensuring that at least one of them differs. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if (a[i].islower() and c[i].islower() and a[i] == c[i]) or \
           (b[i].islower() and c[i].islower() and b[i] == c[i]):
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected function ensures that if either `a` or `b` has a character that matches `c` at the same position, it returns "NO", indicating that no valid template exists. Otherwise, it returns "YES".
