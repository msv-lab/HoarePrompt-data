### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that both strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not.
   - A template `t` can have lowercase or uppercase letters. If a letter in `t` is lowercase, the corresponding letter in `a`, `b`, or `c` must match. If a letter in `t` is uppercase, the corresponding letter in `a`, `b`, or `c` must not match.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if for every character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `c[i]`.
   - If this condition holds for all positions, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
   - However, this function only checks if `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same position, which is not sufficient to determine if a template exists where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` for each.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It only checks if `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same position, which is not enough to determine if a valid template exists.
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a combination of lowercase and uppercase characters in `t` such that `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. This involves more complex logic than what `func_1` provides.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if a valid template exists.

**Correctness: **False**
