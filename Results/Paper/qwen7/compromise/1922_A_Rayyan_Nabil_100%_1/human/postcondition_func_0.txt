The function accepts three parameters: an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \)), and two strings \( a \) and \( b \) each consisting of exactly \( n \) lowercase Latin letters, along with a third string \( c \) also consisting of exactly \( n \) lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if for every index \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \), either \( a[i] \) or \( b[i] \) is equal to \( c[i] \). If such an index is found where both \( a[i] \neq c[i] \) and \( b[i] \neq c[i] \), the function returns 'YES'. If no such index exists, the function returns 'NO'. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns either 'YES' or 'NO'.
