Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is equal to the original value of `a`**.

In this code, the values of `a` and `b` are swapped. Since `a` was originally greater than `b`, after the swap, `a` will take the value of the original `b`, and `b` will take the value of the original `a`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
