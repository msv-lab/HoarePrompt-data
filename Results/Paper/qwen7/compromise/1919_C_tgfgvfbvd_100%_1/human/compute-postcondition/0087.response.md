Postcondition: `n` is a positive integer, `x` is 1, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is equal to the original value of `a`. If `l[1]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `l[1]`. If `l[1]` is greater than `b`, then no change occurs to `b` and `c` is increased by 1.
