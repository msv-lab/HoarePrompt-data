Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `x` is 0 (since it starts from 0 in the range function).
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the changes after one iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `x` is incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as long as the condition `n > 0` holds true.

4. **Check the postconditions and determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The postcondition states that `t` is greater than 0, but this variable is not part of the loop head, so its value does not change within the loop.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - `l`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `x` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is incremented by 1 after each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to positive infinity, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `l[0]` is less than or equal to positive infinity, and `x` is 1.**
