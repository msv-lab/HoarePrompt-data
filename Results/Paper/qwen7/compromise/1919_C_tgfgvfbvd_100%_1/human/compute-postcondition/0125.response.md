Postcondition: `initial_iterations - 2` is the number of remaining iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is the current value of `b`, `b` is the current value of `a`, and `c` remains 0. This is because `l[x]` is greater than `b`.
