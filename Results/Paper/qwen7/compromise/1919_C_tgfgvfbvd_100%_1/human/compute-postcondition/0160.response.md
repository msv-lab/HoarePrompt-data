Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. It returns a specific value based on the conditions given.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value are not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the operations.
