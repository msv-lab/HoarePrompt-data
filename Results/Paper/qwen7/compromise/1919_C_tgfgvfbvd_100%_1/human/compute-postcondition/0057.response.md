Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is set to infinity, `b` is set to infinity, `c` is 0, `x` is equal to `n - 2`.**

The code `c = 0` sets the variable `c` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
