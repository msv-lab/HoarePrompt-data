Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `a` is equal to the original value of `b`.
   - `b` is equal to the original value of `a`.
   - If `l[1]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of `l[1]`. Otherwise, no change occurs to `a` and `b`, and `c` is increased by 1.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for x in range(n):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `x` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes occur to these variables.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - `x` will be 2.
   - `n` remains the same (positive integer).
   - `a` remains the same (equal to the original value of `b`).
   - `b` remains the same (equal to the original value of `a`).
   - `c` remains the same unless modified within the loop body, but since no changes are mentioned, `c` stays the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x` is 2, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is equal to the original value of `a`, and `c` is the same as the previous value.**
