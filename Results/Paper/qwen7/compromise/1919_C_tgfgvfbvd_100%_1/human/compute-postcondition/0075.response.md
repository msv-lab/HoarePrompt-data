Postcondition: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is equal to the element at index `x` in list `l`. If the element at index `x` in list `l` is less than or equal to `b`, then `a` is updated to the value of `b`. Otherwise, `c` is increased by 1, and `a` is updated to the element at index `x` in list `l`, while `b` remains as the original value of `a`.
