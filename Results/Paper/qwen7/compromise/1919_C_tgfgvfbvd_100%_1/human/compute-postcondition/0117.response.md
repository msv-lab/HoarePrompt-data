Postcondition: **`initial_iterations - 2` is the number of remaining iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is the current value of `b`, `b` is the current value of `a`, and `c` is 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`, then `l[x]` is the current value of `a` and `b` retains its original value, and `c` remains 0.**
