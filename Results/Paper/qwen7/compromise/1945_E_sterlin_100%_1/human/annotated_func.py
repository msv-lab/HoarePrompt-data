#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n, and the input consists of t test cases where each test case is defined by n and x followed by a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input provided by the user, which is part of a test case consisting of n and x followed by a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer input from the user, which is part of a test case. This test case includes values for n and x, followed by a permutation of integers from 1 to n. The function then returns this integer input.

def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains integers split from user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converts each integer to a string, and returns a map object containing these integers.

def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a single line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converts each integer to a list element, and returns this list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of n and x, where 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
def func_4():
    return input()
    #The program returns the input provided by the user for the test case, which includes values of n, x, and p (a permutation of integers from 1 to n).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes inputs provided through variables t, n, x, and p, where t is an integer between 1 and 20000, n and x are integers between 1 and 200000, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. It then returns these input values n, x, and p.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a permutation p of length n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n.

    #The program returns a list of strings containing two integers separated by a space.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and returns this list. Each string in the list contains two integers separated by a space.
