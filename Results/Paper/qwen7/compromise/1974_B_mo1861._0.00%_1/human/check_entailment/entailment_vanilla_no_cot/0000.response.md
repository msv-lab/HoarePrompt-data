Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to decode the string but it contains an error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the mapping of characters in the `char_map` dictionary is incorrect. Instead of mapping each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted unique characters of `b`, the current implementation maps each character to a character derived from `'a'` plus the position in reverse order. This results in incorrect decoding.

To fix this, we need to correctly map each character in the encoded string `b` to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted unique characters of `b`. Here's the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Create a list of unique characters in sorted order
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    
    # Create a mapping from each character in b to its symmetric counterpart
    char_map = {char: unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - 1 - i] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    
    # Decode the string b using the mapping
    s = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in b)
    return s
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected for decoding the encoded strings.
