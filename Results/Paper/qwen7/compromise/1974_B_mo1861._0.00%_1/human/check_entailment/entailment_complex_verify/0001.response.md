### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires decoding a string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with unique characters from `s` sorted alphabetically, and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.
   - The decoding process should reverse this operation.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to decode the string `b`.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted unique set of `b` is mapped to its symmetric character in `b`.
   - The mapping is done by calculating the position of each character in the sorted unique set and assigning it the corresponding symmetric character.
   - Finally, the function constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly identifies the unique characters in `b` and sorts them.
   - However, the mapping step in `func_1` is incorrect. The current implementation maps each character in the sorted unique set to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards, but this does not match the required symmetric mapping.
   - For example, if `b = "serofedsoc"`, the unique characters sorted are `'cdefors'`. The symmetric mapping should be:
     - `'c'` -> `'s'`
     - `'d'` -> `'r'`
     - `'e'` -> `'e'`
     - `'f'` -> `'f'`
     - `'o'` -> `'o'`
     - `'r'` -> `'c'`
     - `'s'` -> `'d'`
   - Instead, the current implementation would map these characters to:
     - `'c'` -> `'s'`
     - `'d'` -> `'r'`
     - `'e'` -> `'e'`
     - `'f'` -> `'f'`
     - `'o'` -> `'o'`
     - `'r'` -> `'c'`
     - `'s'` -> `'d'`
   - This results in the wrong mapping because it does not correctly identify the symmetric character in the context of the original string `s`.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly implement the decoding, we need to create a mapping from the unique characters in `b` to their symmetric positions in the original string `s`.
   - We can achieve this by first constructing the auxiliary string `r` from `s` and then using it to create the correct mapping.

### Corrected Code:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    
    # Construct the auxiliary string r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(b)))
    
    # Create the char_map with the correct symmetric mapping
    char_map = {c: r[-(i+1)] for i, c in enumerate(r)}
    
    # Decode the string b to get the original string s
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    
    print(s)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the provided code does not correctly implement the symmetric mapping required for decoding. The corrected code ensures that each character in `b` is mapped to its correct symmetric counterpart from the original string `s`.

**Final: False**
