Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to decode an encoded string `b` by mapping each character back to its original position in the auxiliary string `r`. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and the execution summary:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Mapping**: In the `func_1` function, it creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in the encoded string `b` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reversed order of the unique characters. This is done by sorting the unique characters of `b` and then assigning each character to its reverse position in the alphabet.
3. **Decoding Process**: For each character in the encoded string `b`, the program uses the `char_map` to find the corresponding character in the original string `s` and constructs the decoded string `s`.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program logic aligns with the required steps for decoding. The function correctly maps each character in the encoded string back to its original character in the auxiliary string `r`.

Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
