Postcondition: `ans` is 1 if the first element `c` of the list `s` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `0 + (zeroes - cnt[0])`. `cnt` is [1, 1] if `c` is 0, and [0, 1] if `c` is not 0. `zeroes` remains the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, and `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input that must have at least one element.
