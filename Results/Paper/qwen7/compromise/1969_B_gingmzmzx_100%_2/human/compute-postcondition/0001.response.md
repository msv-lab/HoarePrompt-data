State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head: The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable and `range(n)` to determine the number of iterations. The only variable from the loop head that affects the loop's execution is `n`.
2. Determine the condition for loop execution: The loop will execute if `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0).
3. Consider the initial state: The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer within a specific range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), but this does not directly affect the loop's execution based on the given information.
4. Adjust the necessary states: To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be greater than 0.
