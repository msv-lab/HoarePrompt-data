Output State: **`zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

The code counts the number of zeros in the list `s` and assigns this count to the variable `zeroes`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
