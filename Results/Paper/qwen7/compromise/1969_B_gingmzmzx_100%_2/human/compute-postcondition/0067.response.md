State: **`cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0, `s` must be a non-empty string, `c` is the first character in the string `s`** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `c` is iterating over each character in the string `s`.
- For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string because if `s` is empty, there would be no characters to iterate over.
- Initially, `c` should be set to the first character in the string `s` for the loop to start its first iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `s` (to ensure it's a non-empty string) and `c` (to be the first character in `s`).
