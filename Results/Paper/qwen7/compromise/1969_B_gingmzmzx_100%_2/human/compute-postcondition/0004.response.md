Output State: **`cnt` is [0, 0], `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `cnt` with two zeros. This does not affect the values of `zeroes`, `t`, `n`, or the list `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only change is that `cnt` is now initialized to `[0, 0]`.
