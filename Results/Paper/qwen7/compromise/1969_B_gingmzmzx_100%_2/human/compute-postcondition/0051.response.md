Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list of integers (one element shorter), `c` is the next element in the list `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged, and if `c` is not equal to 0, `ans` is increased by the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`.
