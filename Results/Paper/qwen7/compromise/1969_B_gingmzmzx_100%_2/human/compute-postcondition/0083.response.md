Output State: **`ans` is 1, `cnt` is {0: 1, 1: 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}, `s` is "abc"**

The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the character `c` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `c` is not specified in the initial state, we assume it refers to the last character of the string `s`, which is `'c'`. Therefore, the count of `'c'` in `cnt` is incremented from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
