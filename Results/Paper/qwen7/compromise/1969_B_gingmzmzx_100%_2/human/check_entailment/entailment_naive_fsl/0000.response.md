Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order through cyclic shifts. The logic in the program does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts, which is based on the length of the substring being shifted.

For example, consider the input `101011`. The program would incorrectly output `5` instead of the correct answer `9`.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program fails:

1. The program counts the number of zeros and ones separately but does not calculate the cost of cyclic shifts.
2. It does not simulate the process of performing cyclic shifts and calculating their costs.
3. The logic for determining the cost and the number of shifts needed is missing.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to simulate the process of performing cyclic shifts and keep track of the minimum cost required to sort the string. The provided solution does not implement this logic.
