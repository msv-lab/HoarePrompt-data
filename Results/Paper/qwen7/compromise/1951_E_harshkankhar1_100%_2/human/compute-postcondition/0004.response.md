Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, meaning `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `x` is `-1`.
- `func_1(s[0:])` is `False`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`, regardless of the values of other variables like `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[0:])`.

Output: **1**
