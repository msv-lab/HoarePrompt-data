Postcondition: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, and `func_1(s)` returns `True`. The substring `s[x + 1:]` contains at least one character that matches the first character of `s`. The value of `x` is neither 1 nor half of the length of `s` (i.e., `n // 2`).**
