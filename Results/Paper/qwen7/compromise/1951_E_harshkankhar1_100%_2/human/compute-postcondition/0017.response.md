Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, meaning `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character.
- `func_1(s)` returns `True`.

The `print(2)` statement simply prints the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
