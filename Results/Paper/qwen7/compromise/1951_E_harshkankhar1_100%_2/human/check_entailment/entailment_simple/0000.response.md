### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires partitioning a string into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromic. The provided code attempts to solve this by checking specific conditions.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a string is a palindrome. It works correctly by comparing the string with its reverse.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initial Check**: It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome. If true, it prints "YES", "1", and the string itself, which is a valid partition.
   - **Finding Non-Palindromic Substring**: If the entire string is a palindrome, it looks for the first character that does not match the first character. If found, it considers the substring up to this point and the rest of the string.
   - **Handling Edge Cases**: 
     - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it prints "NO".
     - If the substring starting from `x + 1` is also a palindrome, it checks further conditions to decide the partition.
     - Otherwise, it prints a valid partition.

4. **Execution Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the cases where the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The edge cases are handled appropriately, ensuring that the output is correct for all given examples.

5. **Examples**:
   - For `"sinktheyacht"`, the entire string is not a palindrome, so it prints "YES", "1", and the string itself.
   - For `"lllllllll"`, every substring is a palindrome, so it prints "NO".
   - For `"uwuowouwu"`, it finds a valid partition and prints "YES", "3", and the partitioned substrings.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Correctness:
