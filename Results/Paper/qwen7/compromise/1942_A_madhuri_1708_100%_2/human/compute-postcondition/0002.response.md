Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case:
- If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is equal to `k`, it will print a line with `k` repeated `k` times.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is not equal to `k`, it will print `-1`.
- If `k` is less than 2, it will print a line with numbers from 1 to `n`.

Each line's content depends on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case provided in the input.
