Output State: The output state will consist of 'Bob' or 'Alice' printed for each line of input provided within the range of `t`. Specifically, 'Bob' will be printed if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' will be printed if the sum is odd. The exact sequence of 'Bob' and 'Alice' depends on the input values for `a` and `b` for each iteration of the loop.
