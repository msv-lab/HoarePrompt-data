Output State: The output state will consist of 'Bob' or 'Alice' printed for each line of input provided within the range of `t`. Specifically, for each input line, if the sum of the two integers `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' will be printed; otherwise, 'Alice' will be printed. The exact sequence of 'Bob' and 'Alice' will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
