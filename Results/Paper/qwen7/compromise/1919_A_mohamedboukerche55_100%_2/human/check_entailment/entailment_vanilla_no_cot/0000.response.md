Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy described in the problem. The solution incorrectly assumes that the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner, which is not accurate according to the game rules.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of coins in Alice's wallet at the start of her turn. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Determine the winner based on the parity of the number of coins in Alice's wallet
        if a % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This solution checks if the number of coins in Alice's wallet (`a`) is even or odd. If `a` is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because:
- If `a` is even, Alice can always mirror Bob's moves, ensuring she never runs out of coins.
- If `a` is odd, Alice will eventually run out of coins first if both play optimally.
