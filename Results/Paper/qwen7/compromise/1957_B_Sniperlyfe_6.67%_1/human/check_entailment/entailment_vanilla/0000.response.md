Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the bitwise OR of these integers has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence for a single test case.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with `n` zeros.
   - It then fills the list with `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` for each element. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits (i.e., `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`), ensuring that each element contributes the maximum possible number of 1s in the binary representation.
   - After filling `n-1` elements, it adjusts the last element to ensure the total sum is `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is small enough, the above approach might not work because the largest possible number with `k.bit_length()` bits might exceed `k`. For example, if `k = 1`, the largest possible number with 1 bit is `1`, but the sum of `n` such numbers would be `n`, which could be greater than `1` for `n > 1`.
   - The current implementation does not handle cases where `k` is less than `n * (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - (n - 1)`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The current implementation does not consider the edge case where `k` is smaller than the sum of the largest possible values for `n-1` elements.
   - The bitwise OR operation will not necessarily maximize the number of 1s if the values chosen do not fit within the constraints.

Given these points, the provided solution is not fully correct as it does not handle all edge cases properly.

Correctness: **False**
