Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how the `func_1` function constructs the sequence of numbers. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Numbers**: The line `nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is setting each element of the array to a value that is too large and does not necessarily contribute to maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. This approach assumes that each number should be set to a high value, but it doesn't consider the sum constraint and the bitwise OR requirement.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Sum**: After setting initial values, the code subtracts from `k`, but this does not ensure that the remaining elements will maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.

A better approach would involve constructing the sequence such that the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized while ensuring the sum constraint is met. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function that attempts to achieve this:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    # Initialize the result list with zeros
    nums = [0] * n
    
    # Distribute the sum k among the n elements
    for i in range(n):
        # If k is greater than or equal to (1 << i), set nums[i] to (1 << i) - 1
        if k >= (1 << i):
            nums[i] = (1 << i) - 1
            k -= (1 << i) - 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, set nums[i] to k and break out of the loop
            nums[i] = k
            break
    
    # Ensure the sum of nums is k
    if sum(nums) != k:
        nums[-1] += (k - sum(nums))
    
    return nums
```

This revised function tries to set each element to the highest possible value that contributes to the bitwise OR being maximized, while ensuring the sum constraint is met. It then adjusts the last element to make sure the total sum is `k`.

However, even this approach might not always produce the optimal solution due to the complexity of the problem. A more sophisticated approach might be needed to guarantee the optimal solution for all cases.
