Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Template Construction**: The program constructs a template by comparing characters of `a` and `b`. If both characters at the same index are the same, it appends the character from `a` to the template. If they differ, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a`.

2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - It checks if `a` and `b` match the constructed template.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template.

3. **Output**:
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template, and `c` does not, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic is sound and handles all the specified conditions accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
