### Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**: The function constructs a template based on the characters of `a` and `b`. If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the character from `a` directly to the template. If they are different, it appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the template. This ensures that both `a` and `b` will match the template if the conditions are met.

2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - For `a` and `b` to match the template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must match.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must not match the lowercase version of the template character.
   - For `c` to not match the template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in `c` must not match.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in `c` must match the lowercase version of the template character.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The function checks if `a` and `b` match the constructed template by iterating through each character and ensuring the conditions are met.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template under the same conditions.

4. **Output**:
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The logic for constructing the template and checking the matching conditions seems correct based on the problem statement.
- The implementation handles the conditions for both `a`, `b`, and `c` correctly.
- The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the function.

### Conclusion:
The given program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
