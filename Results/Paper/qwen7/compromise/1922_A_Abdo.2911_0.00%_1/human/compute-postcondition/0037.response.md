Postcondition: `match_a_b` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase character, if either `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`. If neither condition is met, the postcondition remains as initially stated with `match_a_b` being True, `i` being 0, and `template[i]` not being a lowercase character.
