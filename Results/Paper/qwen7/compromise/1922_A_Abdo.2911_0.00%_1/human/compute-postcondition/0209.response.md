Output: **YES**

Explanation: The print statement directly outputs the string 'YES'. None of the variables (`match_c`, `i`, `n`, `match_a_b`) affect this output because the print statement does not reference any of these variables. The values of `match_c`, `i`, `n`, and `match_a_b` are provided in the initial state but do not influence the printed output in this specific case.
