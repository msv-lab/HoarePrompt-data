Postcondition: `match_a_b` is True or False depending on whether `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`. If either condition is met, `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`. If neither condition is met, the program continues execution without changing `match_a_b`, `i`, or `n`.
