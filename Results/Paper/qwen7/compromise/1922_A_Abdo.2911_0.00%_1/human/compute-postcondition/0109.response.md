State: **`match_a_b` is `True`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `c` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `template` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine Initial Values**: 
   - `i` is typically initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - Whether the loop executes depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once.
3. **Adjust States**:
   - Since `i` is usually set to 0 at the start of the loop, we need to ensure `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 0 and `n` to be greater than 0. The other variables (`match_a_b`, `match_c`, `c`, and `template`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and do not need to be adjusted.
