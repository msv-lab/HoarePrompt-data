Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `match_a_b` is True
   - `i` is 0
   - The condition for `match_a_b` being True is that either `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`. Otherwise, the most internal loop or statement is broken and `i` remains 0.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`.
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1 (assuming `n` is greater than 1).

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Postcondition:**
   - The postcondition for `match_a_b` being True is that either `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`. However, since `i` is now 1, this condition will be checked for `i=1` in the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`match_a_b` is True, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
