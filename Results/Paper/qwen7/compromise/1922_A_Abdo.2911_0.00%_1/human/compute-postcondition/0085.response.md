Postcondition: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True if the character at index `i` in `c` matches the character at the same index in `template` (ignoring case), otherwise it is False, and the value of `i` remains `n-1`. If the characters match, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
