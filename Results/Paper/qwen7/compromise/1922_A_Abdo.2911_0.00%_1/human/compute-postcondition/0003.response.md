Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string equal to the stripped input value.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the input, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged as it was an input integer. Therefore, `n` is still an input integer, and `a` is now a string containing the stripped input value.
