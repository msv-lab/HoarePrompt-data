Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `template` is a list with one element which is `a[3].upper()`**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i].upper()` to the `template` list. Given that `i` is 3, `a[3].upper()` is appended to `template`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 3 and `n` must still be greater than 3.
