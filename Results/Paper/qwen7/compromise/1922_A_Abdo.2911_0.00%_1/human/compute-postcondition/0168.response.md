State: **`match_c` is True, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `n >= 1` must be true because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
4. The initial state of `match_c` being `True` does not affect the loop's execution, so it needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial value of `i` and the condition on `n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute, which means `i` should be 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.
