Output State: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is not lowercase, and the lowercase version of the character at index `i` in `c` is equal to the lowercase version of the character at index `i` in `template`.**

Explanation: The line `match_c = False` sets the variable `match_c` to `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
