Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `match_a_b` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states, but the action of breaking out of the loop or if statement is noted.
