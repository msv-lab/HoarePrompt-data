Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `match_a_b` is explicitly set to `False`. The value of `i` is `i + 1`, which means it has been incremented by 1 from its previous value. The condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on `n`.
