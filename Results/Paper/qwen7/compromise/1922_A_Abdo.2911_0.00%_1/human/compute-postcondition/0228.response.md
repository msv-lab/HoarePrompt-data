Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `template` has appended `a[1].upper()` to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i].upper()` to the list `template`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[1].upper()` is appended to `template`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
