Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it constructs a template string based on the comparison of a and b. It then checks if the template matches a and b under specific conditions and compares the template with c. Finally, it prints 'YES' if the template matches a and b but not c, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
