Postcondition: `match_a_b` is a boolean value indicating whether the elements at index `i` in arrays `a` and `b` match the corresponding element in `template`. If `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If both `a[i].lower()` and `b[i].lower()` match `template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` remains unchanged as `True`, and `i` is incremented by 1, with `n` still being greater than `i + 1`. If neither condition is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
