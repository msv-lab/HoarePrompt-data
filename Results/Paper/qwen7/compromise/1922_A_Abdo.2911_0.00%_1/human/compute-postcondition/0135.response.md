Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, and either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `match_a_b = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `match_a_b`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `template[i]`, `a[i]`, or `b[i]`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
