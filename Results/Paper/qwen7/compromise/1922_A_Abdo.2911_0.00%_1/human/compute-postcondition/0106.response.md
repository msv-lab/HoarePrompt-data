Output State: **`match_a_b` is `True`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `b` is an input string after stripping whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` assigns the value of the stripped whitespace of the user's input to the variable `b`. The initial states of `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain unchanged. Therefore, `match_a_b` is still `True`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, and `b` is the input string after stripping whitespace.
