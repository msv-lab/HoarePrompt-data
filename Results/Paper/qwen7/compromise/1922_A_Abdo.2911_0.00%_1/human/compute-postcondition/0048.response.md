Postcondition: `match_a_b` is True, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, the postcondition remains as the precondition.
