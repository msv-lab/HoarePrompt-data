Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `match_a_b` is explicitly set to `False`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state because no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet. The condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` remains a valid precondition.
