Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the first element of the template is not a lowercase letter, if the character at index `i` in `c` matches the character at index `i` in `template` when both are converted to lowercase. Otherwise, `match_c` remains True, `i` is still 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the first element of the template is not a lowercase letter.
