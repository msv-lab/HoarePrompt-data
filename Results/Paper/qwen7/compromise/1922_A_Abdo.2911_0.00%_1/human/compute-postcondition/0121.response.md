Postcondition: `match_a_b` is `True`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `c` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `template` is a list that includes at least the first element being either `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, and now includes `a[i]` as its second element if `a[i] == b[i]`, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 0.
