Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `match_a_b` is True
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning it will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if either `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, the loop will break.

4. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - Since the loop is iterating from `0` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` would be `2`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to `2`.
   - `match_a_b` remains unchanged unless the loop breaks due to the conditions mentioned.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`match_a_b` is True, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
