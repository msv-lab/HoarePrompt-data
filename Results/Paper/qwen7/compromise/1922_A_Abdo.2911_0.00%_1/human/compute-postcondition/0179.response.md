Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is not lowercase. The current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` in lowercase, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `match_c`, `i`, `n`, or the character at index `i` in `template`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is inside. Therefore, these variables retain their original values, and the condition about the character at index `i` in `template` also remains unchanged.
