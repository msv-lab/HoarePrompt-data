Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then reassembling them.
- The provided solution only checks if \(b\) is an even number and returns 'yes' if true, otherwise 'no'.
- However, this logic is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly. Here's why:
  - If \(b\) is even, the program correctly identifies that \(b\) can be divided into two equal halves, allowing for the formation of a new rectangle. For example, a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, which can be reassembled to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.
  - But if \(b\) is odd, the program incorrectly concludes that no other rectangle can be formed. However, there are cases where an odd \(b\) still allows forming a different rectangle. For example, a \(2 \times 3\) rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 3\) rectangles, which can be reassembled to form a \(3 \times 2\) rectangle.
- Therefore, the function should check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is greater than 1, which ensures that at least one dimension can be split further, allowing for the formation of a new rectangle.

Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly address all possible scenarios for forming a new rectangle.
