You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2

    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
    #The program returns 'yes' if 'b' is an even number, otherwise it returns 'no'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^9. It checks whether `b` is an even number and returns 'yes' if true, otherwise it returns 'no'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is called for each test case.
   - It checks if `b` is even using the condition `b % 2 == 0`.
   - If `b` is even, it returns `'yes'`.
   - If `b` is odd, it returns `'no'`.

3. **Output:**
   - The result of `func_1(a, b)` is printed for each test case.

### Problem Description Analysis:

- **Objective:** Determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- **Key Points:**
  - A rectangle can always be cut into two smaller rectangles.
  - The resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
  - The key observation is whether the original rectangle can be split in such a way that the resulting pieces can form a new distinct rectangle.

### Key Observations:

- **Case 1: Both Dimensions are Even:**
  - If both `a` and `b` are even, the rectangle can be cut into four smaller rectangles of equal size, and these can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
  - Example: A 4x4 rectangle can be cut into four 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 2x8 rectangle.

- **Case 2: One Dimension is Even, the Other is Odd:**
  - If one dimension is even and the other is odd, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles where at least one dimension is even.
  - Example: A 4x3 rectangle can be cut into two 4x1.5 rectangles, but since we need integer dimensions, it can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 6x2 rectangle.

- **Case 3: Both Dimensions are Odd:**
  - If both dimensions are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.
  - Example: A 3x3 rectangle can only be cut into 1x3 rectangles, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new distinct rectangle.

### Conclusion:

The provided program only checks if `b` is even. However, the correct logic should consider both dimensions `a` and `b`. Specifically, the program should check if either `a` or `b` is even, as this ensures that the rectangle can be cut into smaller pieces that can form a new distinct rectangle.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the provided program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, missing the case where `a` is even. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
