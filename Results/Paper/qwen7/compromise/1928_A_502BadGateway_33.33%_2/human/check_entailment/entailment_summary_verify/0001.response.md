### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the provided program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, missing the case where `a` is even. Let's re-evaluate the program and the function summary to confirm this conclusion.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if `b` is even and returns `'yes'` if true, otherwise `'no'`.

#### Program Recap:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))
```

#### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the dimensions `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` only checks if `b` is even. This is a critical oversight because it fails to consider the case where `a` could be even.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(a, b)` for each test case, which is `'yes'` if `b` is even and `'no'` otherwise.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Bob needs to determine if he can form another rectangle by cutting the given rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- The key observation is that if either `a` or `b` is even, the rectangle can be cut and rearranged to form a new distinct rectangle.

#### Correct Logic:
- To correctly solve the problem, the function should check if either `a` or `b` is even. This is because:
  - If `a` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with one even dimension.
  - If `b` is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with one even dimension.

#### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

#### Testing the Correctness:
- **Test Case 1: (1, 1)**
  - Both dimensions are odd, so no new rectangle can be formed.
  - Expected Output: `No`
- **Test Case 2: (2, 1)**
  - `a` is even, so a new rectangle can be formed.
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
- **Test Case 3: (2, 6)**
  - Both dimensions are even, so a new rectangle can be formed.
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
- **Test Case 4: (3, 2)**
  - `b` is even, so a new rectangle can be formed.
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
- **Test Case 5: (2, 2)**
  - Both dimensions are even, so a new rectangle can be formed.
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
- **Test Case 6: (2, 4)**
  - Both dimensions are even, so a new rectangle can be formed.
  - Expected Output: `Yes`
- **Test Case 7: (6, 3)**
  - `a` is even, so a new rectangle can be formed.
  - Expected Output: `Yes`

The original program only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient. The correct implementation should check if either `a` or `b` is even.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate. The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, missing the case where `a` could be even.

**Final: False**
