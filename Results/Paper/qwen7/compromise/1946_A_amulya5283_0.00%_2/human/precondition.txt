t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description contains an integer n representing the length of the array a, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n representing the array a. The value of n ranges from 1 to 10^5, and each a_i ranges from 1 to 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
