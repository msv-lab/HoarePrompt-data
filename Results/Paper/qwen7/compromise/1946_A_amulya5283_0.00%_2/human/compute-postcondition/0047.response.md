Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `operations` is 3
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`
   - `arr` is now sorted
   - `median_index` is `n // 2`
   - `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`
   - `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end
   - `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3
   - `smallest` is the original smallest element plus 2
   - `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times
   - `results` is [3]

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is an external condition and not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented to 2.
- `t` remains the same (greater than 0).

The new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3, `smallest` is the original smallest element plus 2, `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times, `results` is [3]**
