Output State: **`heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3; `current_median` remains unchanged; `smallest` holds the original smallest element; `operations` is 3; `results` is a list containing 3.**

Explanation: The loop has executed 3 times, incrementing the smallest element by 1 each time and pushing it back into the heap, while also incrementing the `operations` counter. The `results.append(operations)` line appends the value of `operations` (which is 3) to the `results` list. All other variables remain in their respective states from the last iteration of the loop.
