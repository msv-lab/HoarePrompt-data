Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the median value of `arr`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3, `smallest` is the original smallest element plus 2, `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times, `results` is [3, `n`, `arr[0]`], `heap` is now a slice of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end.**

Explanation: The line `heap = arr[median_index:]` updates the `heap` variable to be a slice of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end of the array. All other variables remain unchanged.
