You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (the length of the array a) followed by n integers representing the array a. The length of each array a satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^5 and each element of the array a satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()
        
        median_index = n // 2
        
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        operations = 0
        
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: Output State: `operations` is 3 for each iteration, `t` is the total number of test cases, `i` ranges from 0 to `t-1`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]` for each iteration, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]` for each iteration, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` remains unchanged as it is the value of `arr[median_index]` for each iteration, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` for each iteration, `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3 for each iteration, `smallest` holds the original smallest element for each iteration, `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times for each iteration, and `results` is a list containing 3 for each iteration.
    #
    #This means that for every test case, the loop performs exactly 3 operations, and the `results` list will contain 3 for each test case after all iterations of the loop have completed.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of 3 for each test case after all iterations of the loop have completed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases) and test_cases (a list of tuples). Each tuple contains an integer n (the length of the array a) followed by n integers representing the array a. After processing all test cases, the function returns a list of 3 for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of 3 for each test case after all iterations of the loop have completed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
