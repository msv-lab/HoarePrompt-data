The only variable in the loop head is `heap[0]`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `heap[0]`. If `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `heap[0]` is `smallest + 1`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`.

State: **`heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`**
