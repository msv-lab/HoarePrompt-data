Output State: **`heap` contains the smallest element plus one, `smallest` is now the value that was at the root of the heap before `heapq.heappop(heap)` was called, `operations` is increased by 1.**

The code `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. The values of `heap` and `smallest` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `operations`.
