Output State: `operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3, `smallest` is the original smallest element plus 2, and `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times.

This output state describes the final condition after the loop has executed all its iterations. The `operations` counter indicates the total number of operations performed, which is 3. The `heap` has been modified such that its root (the smallest element) has been incremented by 3, and the `smallest` variable holds the value of the original smallest element plus 2.
