Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`**.

This means that the variable `current_median` has been assigned the value of the element at index `median_index` in the array `arr`. All other variables retain their initial conditions from the initial state.
