Output State: **`heap[0]` is now greater than `current_median`; `smallest` is the value that was at the root of the heap (`heap[0]` before popping); `heap` has a new element which is `smallest + 1`; `operations` is incremented by 1.**

In this scenario, the variable `operations` is incremented by 1 due to the execution of the line `operations += 1`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
