Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element being `smallest + 2`, `smallest` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the array `arr`. Since `arr` was previously sorted with the smallest element being `smallest + 3`, after sorting, the smallest element in `arr` is now `smallest + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
