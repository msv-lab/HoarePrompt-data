Output State: **The program returns a list of 3 for each test case after all iterations of the loop have completed.**

This means that regardless of the number of test cases (`t`), the `results` list will contain the value `3` repeated for each test case, as the loop performs exactly 3 operations for each iteration and does not modify the value of `results`.
