Output State: The loop continues to execute as long as the root of the heap (`heap[0]`) is less than or equal to `current_median`. After all iterations, the root of the heap (`heap[0]`) will be greater than `current_median`. Each time the loop runs, the smallest element from the heap is popped, incremented by 1, and pushed back into the heap. The `operations` counter keeps track of how many times the loop has executed. 

Since the loop stops when `heap[0]` becomes greater than `current_median`, the final state of the heap will have its root as the smallest element that is just above `current_median`. The `operations` variable will hold the total number of times the loop executed until this condition was met. All other variables' states remain unchanged from their initial or intermediate states.
