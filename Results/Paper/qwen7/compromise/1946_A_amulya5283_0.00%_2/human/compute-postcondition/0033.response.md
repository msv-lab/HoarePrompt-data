Output State: **`operations` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end excluding the smallest element, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`.**

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap `heap` and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The heap `heap` is updated to exclude the smallest element that was just popped.
