Output State: **`heap[0]` is now `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the value that was at the root of the heap (`heap[0]`) before it was removed.**

Explanation: The code uses `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` to add `smallest + 1` back into the heap. Since `heapq.heappush` maintains the heap property, the new value `smallest + 1` is pushed into the heap. The initial condition that `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median` is not directly impacted by this operation, but `heap[0]` is updated to `smallest + 1`. The value of `smallest` remains unchanged as it was only used to identify the root element before it was removed.
