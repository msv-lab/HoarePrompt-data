Output State: **`operations` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `heap` is a heap data structure.**

Explanation: The line `operations = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `operations`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
