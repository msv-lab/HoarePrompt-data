The code `median_index = n // 2` simply reassigns the value of `median_index` to be the same as `n // 2`. Since `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, and no changes are made to `n` or `median_index` within the given code snippet, the value of `median_index` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3, `smallest` is the original smallest element plus 2, `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times, `results` is [3, `n`, `arr[0]`], `median_index` is `n // 2`.**
