Output State: **`heap[0]` is now `smallest + 1`, `current_median` is unchanged, `smallest` is the value that was at `heap[0]` before popping, `operations` is increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `heap[0]` has been updated to `smallest + 1`, `current_median` remains unchanged, `smallest` retains its previous value (which was at `heap[0]` before popping), and `operations` has been incremented by 1.
