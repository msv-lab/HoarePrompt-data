The code `current_median = arr[median_index]` simply reassigns the value of `current_median` to be the same as `arr[median_index]`. Since `median_index` is `n // 2` and `arr` is sorted, `arr[median_index]` is the median value of the array `arr`. Therefore, `current_median` is unchanged and still holds the value of the median of `arr`.

All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.

Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the median value of `arr`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3, `smallest` is the original smallest element plus 2, `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times, `results` is [3, `n`, `arr[0]`]**.
