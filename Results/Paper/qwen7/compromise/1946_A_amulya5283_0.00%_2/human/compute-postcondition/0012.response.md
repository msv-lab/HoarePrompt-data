Output State: **`operations` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr`, `heap[0]` is now the smallest element popped from the heap, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from the heap, `heap` has the smallest element (which was previously `heap[0]`) pushed back with a value of `smallest + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
