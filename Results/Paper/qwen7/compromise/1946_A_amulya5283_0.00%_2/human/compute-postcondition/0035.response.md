Output State: **`operations` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end excluding the smallest element, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, `heap` is updated to include `smallest + 1` as the smallest element plus one.**

Explanation: The line `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
