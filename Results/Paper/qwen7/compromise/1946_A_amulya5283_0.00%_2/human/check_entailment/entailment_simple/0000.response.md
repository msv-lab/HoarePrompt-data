Reasoning:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by sorting the array and using a min-heap to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Median Index**: The median index should be calculated as `median_index = (n - 1) // 2` for odd-length arrays and `median_index = n // 2 - 1` for even-length arrays. This is because the index is zero-based, and the median is the middle value in the sorted array.

2. **Heap Initialization and Operations Counting**: The heap is initialized incorrectly. It should only contain elements from the array starting from the median index onwards. Additionally, the operations count should be incremented only when the smallest element in the heap is less than or equal to the current median.

3. **Incorrect Loop Logic**: The loop logic is flawed. It unnecessarily increments the smallest element in the heap until it exceeds the current median, which is not the optimal approach. Instead, we need to find the difference between the current median and the smallest element in the heap and increment the operations count accordingly.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Correctness: **False**
