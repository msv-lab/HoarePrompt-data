Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program correctly reads the input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the split data to extract the number of test cases (`t`) and the arrays for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program sorts the array to find the median.
   - It calculates the median index as `n // 2` for even-length arrays and `(n // 2) + 1` for odd-length arrays. However, the code only uses `n // 2`, which is correct for both even and odd lengths since the ceiling of `n / 2` is handled by the array slicing and indexing.
   - It initializes a heap with elements from the median index onwards.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - The program repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.
   - This approach ensures that the median is increased to the next possible value with the minimum number of operations.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The number of operations required to achieve this is stored and added to the results list.

5. **Output**:
   - The results are printed out, one per line, corresponding to each test case.

However, there is a small issue with the way the median is being calculated and used. The median should be the element at the position `ceil(n/2)` in the sorted array. For an even-sized array, the median is typically taken as the average of the two middle elements, but here it is being treated as the element at `n//2`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the median is correctly identified as the middle element(s) in the sorted array. Here's the corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        (n, arr) = test_cases[i]
        arr.sort()
        median_index = n // 2
        if n % 2 == 0:
            median_value = (arr[median_index - 1] + arr[median_index]) / 2
        else:
            median_value = arr[median_index]
        current_median = median_value
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        operations = 0
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        results.append(operations)
    return results
```

With this correction, the program will correctly identify the median and perform the necessary operations to increase it.

Correctness: **False**
