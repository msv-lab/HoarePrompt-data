Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program uses a min-heap to keep track of elements greater than or equal to the current median. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of operations. 

Consider the following test case:
```
3
2 2 8
```
The program's output for this case is `1`, but the correct output should be `1` as well. However, consider another test case:
```
4
7 3 3 1
```
The program's output for this case is `2`, but the correct output should be `1`. Here's how to achieve the correct output:

1. Sort the array: `[1, 3, 3, 7]`.
2. The median is `3` (at index 2).
3. We need to make the element at index 2 greater than `3`.

We can achieve this by increasing the element at index 1 to `4` (which requires 1 operation), making the array `[1, 4, 3, 7]`, and the median becomes `3.5`, which is greater than `3`.

The provided program does not handle this scenario correctly, as it uses a min-heap to increment elements, which might not always yield the minimum number of operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
