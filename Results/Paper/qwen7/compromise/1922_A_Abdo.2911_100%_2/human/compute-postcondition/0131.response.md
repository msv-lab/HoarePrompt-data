Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `possible` is `False`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The only thing affected is that the program will continue to the next iteration of the loop (if there was one), but the variables themselves do not change.
