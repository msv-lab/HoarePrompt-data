Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` remains `False`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` up to index `i-1` will reflect the conditions checked within the loop, while the elements from index `i` onwards will not be checked and thus their original values in `a`, `b`, and `c` will remain unchanged.
