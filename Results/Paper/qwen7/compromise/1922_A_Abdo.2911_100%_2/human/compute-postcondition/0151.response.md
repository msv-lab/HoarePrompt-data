Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise `possible` remains `True`.
   - `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace.
   - `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace.
   - `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the range and does not change within the loop.
   - `possible` remains `True` because the condition for `possible` is based on the value of `c[i]` relative to `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and since `i` is incremented, the condition for `possible` will be checked again with the new value of `i`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` becomes `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `possible` remains `True`.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `t` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
