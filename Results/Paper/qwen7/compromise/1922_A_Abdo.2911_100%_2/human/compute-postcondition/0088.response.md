Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True if `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
