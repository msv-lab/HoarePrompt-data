Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables involved in the loop head:
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`, so the variables involved are `i` and `n`.

2. Determine the initial state of these variables:
   - `i` is not initialized in the given state, so it should be set to the starting value of the loop, which is `0`.
   - `n` is already given as an input integer.

3. Ensure the loop condition is met:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`.

4. Adjust the states accordingly:
   - `i` should be `0`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is the stripped input string from user.
- `b` is the stripped input string from user.
- `c` is the stripped input string from user.
- `possible` is `False`.

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
