Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than 0.
- `possible` is `True`.
- `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace.
- `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace.
- `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace.
- `t` is greater than 0.

The loop has completed all its iterations without finding a case where `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` does not equal `b[i]`, so `possible` remains `True`.

Given this information, the print statement `print('YES')` will simply output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
