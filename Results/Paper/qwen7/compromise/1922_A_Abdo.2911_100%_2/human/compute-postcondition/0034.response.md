Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or the most nested block it is within. In this case, since there is no explicit loop structure given, the `break` statement indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or conditional block we were inside. The values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `possible` remain unchanged as per the initial state, and the `break` statement is noted.
