Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will take on values from 0 to `n-1` during each iteration.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n`, and `i` will iterate from 0 to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` being equal to `n` is not relevant for the loop execution, but it is part of the initial state.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is False, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0**
