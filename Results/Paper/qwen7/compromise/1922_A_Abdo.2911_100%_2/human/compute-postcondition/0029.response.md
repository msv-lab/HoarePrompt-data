Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the execution will exit the current context where this `break` statement is placed. The values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `possible` remain unchanged from their initial states.
