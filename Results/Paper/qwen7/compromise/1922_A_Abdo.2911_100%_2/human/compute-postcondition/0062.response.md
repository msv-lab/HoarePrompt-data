Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` remains the same, the value of `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` up to index `i-1` will reflect the conditions checked within the loop, while the elements from index `i` onwards will retain their original values, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input string, strips it of any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
