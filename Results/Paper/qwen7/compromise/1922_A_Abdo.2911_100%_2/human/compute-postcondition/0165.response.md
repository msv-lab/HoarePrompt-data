Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is greater than 0.
- `possible` is `True`.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are the input string stripped of whitespace.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- No condition within the loop broke the execution, meaning `c[i]` was always equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` was never equal to `b[i]` for any `i` from `n-1` down to 0.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Given this information, the output of the print statement is straightforward and does not depend on the values of other variables.

Output: **NO**
