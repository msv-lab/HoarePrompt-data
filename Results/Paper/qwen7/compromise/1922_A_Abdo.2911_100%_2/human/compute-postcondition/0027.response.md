Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - If the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are equal, then `c[0]` must also be equal to `a[0` (or no change occurs).
   - If the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal, then `possible` is set to True if `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1, the new value of `i` will be 1.
   - The condition `n > 0` remains unchanged as it is an invariant condition for the loop.

4. **Post-Condition for the New Iteration:**
   - If the elements at index `i` (now `i = 1`) of lists `a` and `b` are equal, then `c[1]` must also be equal to `a[1]` (or no change occurs).
   - If the elements at index `i` (now `i = 1`) of lists `a` and `b` are not equal, then `possible` is set to True if `c[1]` is neither equal to `a[1]` nor `b[1]`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 1
   - `n` must still be greater than 0
   - The conditions for `c[1]` based on the comparison of `a[1]` and `b[1]` apply.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and if the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are equal, then `c[1]` must also be equal to `a[1` (or no change occurs). If the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `b` are not equal, then `possible` is set to True if `c[1]` is neither equal to `a[1]` nor `b[1]`**.
