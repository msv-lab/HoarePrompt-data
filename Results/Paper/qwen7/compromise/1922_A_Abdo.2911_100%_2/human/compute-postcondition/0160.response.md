Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` must still be greater than 0. The variable `possible` is set to `True` if any condition within the loop body evaluates to breaking out of the loop with `possible` being `True`. Since the loop continues until it either breaks due to the conditions specified or completes all iterations, `possible` will remain `True` as long as the loop condition was met at least once during the iterations. The strings `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `t` must still be greater than 0.
