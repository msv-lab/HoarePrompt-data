Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise `possible` remains `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.
