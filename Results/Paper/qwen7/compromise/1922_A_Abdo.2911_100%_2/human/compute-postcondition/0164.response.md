Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0. Additionally, no condition within the loop broke the execution, meaning `c[i]` was always equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` was never equal to `b[i]` for any `i` from `n-1` down to 0.**
