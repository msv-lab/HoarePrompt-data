Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True` if `c[n-1]` is not equal to `a[n-1]` or `c[n-1]` equals `b[n-1]`, otherwise `possible` remains `True`, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
