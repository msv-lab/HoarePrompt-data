Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of whitespace, and `t` must be greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
