Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `False` to track whether a valid template can be found.
4. It then iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop since this indicates a valid template can be found.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, and `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, it continues to the next iteration since this does not violate the template conditions.
   - If neither of the above conditions are met, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that no valid template can be found.
5. After the loop, it prints 'YES' if `possible` is `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.
6. The logic in the loop correctly checks the conditions for a valid template and handles the cases where a valid template can or cannot be found.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template that matches the conditions for strings `a` and `b` but not for string `c`.

Correctness: **True**
