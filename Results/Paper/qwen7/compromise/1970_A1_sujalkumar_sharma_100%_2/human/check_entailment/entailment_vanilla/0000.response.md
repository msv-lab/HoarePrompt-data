Reasoning:
1. The program reads a balanced parentheses sequence from the input.
2. It calculates the prefix balance for each character in the sequence and stores the balance, position, and character in a list `prefix_balance`.
3. The list `prefix_balance` is sorted based on the prefix balance in ascending order. In case of a tie, it sorts by position in descending order.
4. After sorting, it constructs the resulting balanced shuffle sequence by concatenating the characters in the sorted list.
5. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
6. The main part of the program calls `func_1` with the input string and prints the result.

Given the steps outlined above, the provided program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
