Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" characters, representing a balanced parentheses sequence. It calculates the balance of parentheses up to each position in the string, stores this information along with the index and character in a list, sorts this list based on balance and index, and finally constructs and returns a new string containing the characters from `s` in the order specified by the sorted list.**
