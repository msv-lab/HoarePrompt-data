Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains the current balance value, the index `i`, and the character `s[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `n-1`; `balance` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `prefix_balance` list based on the first element of each tuple (balance value) in ascending order. The second element (index `i`) is also considered in case of ties, sorting in descending order. This means that the list is now ordered such that tuples with lower balance values come first, and among those with the same balance value, the tuples with higher indices come first. The `balance` variable remains unchanged at 0.
