Output State: **`success` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `position` is `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `time_available` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `bullets_needed` is `monsters[i][1]`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + monsters[i][1]`, `bullets_needed` is `monsters[i][1]**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `bullets_needed` to be equal to `health`, which is `monsters[i][1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
