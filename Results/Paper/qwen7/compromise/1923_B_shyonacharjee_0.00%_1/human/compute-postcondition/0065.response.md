Postcondition: **`success` is False, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `i` is 4, and either the `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available` in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or the condition is not met.**
