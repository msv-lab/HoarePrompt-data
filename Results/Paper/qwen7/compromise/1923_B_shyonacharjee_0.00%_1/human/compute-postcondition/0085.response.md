Output State: **`success` is False, `position` is the position of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the `position`, `time_available` equals `distance`, `i` is `n-1`, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `t` is `n+1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions.**

Explanation: The line `total_bullets_used = 0` simply initializes the variable `total_bullets_used` to 0. It does not affect any other variables or the conditions given in the initial state. Therefore, all other variables retain their initial values.
