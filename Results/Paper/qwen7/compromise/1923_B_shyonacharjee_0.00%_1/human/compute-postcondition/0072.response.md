Output State: **`success` is False, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `i` is 5, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list.**

Explanation: The line `success = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `success`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, all other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
