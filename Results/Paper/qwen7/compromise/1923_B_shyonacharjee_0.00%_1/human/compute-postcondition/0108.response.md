Output State: **`success` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `position` is `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `time_available` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `bullets_needed` is `monsters[i][1]`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + monsters[n][1] + monsters[i][1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `position` and `health` variables to the values of `monsters[i][0]` and `monsters[i][1]` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
