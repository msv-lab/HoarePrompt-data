Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `success` is True, `total_bullets_used` is equal to the sum of the health of all monsters in the `monsters` list, `positions` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input, `healths` is a list of integers converted from input, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `n` is updated to the integer value of the first input, `k` is updated to the integer value of the second input, `i` is `n-2`, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, and `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list; `total_bullets_used` is set to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total_bullets_used` is incremented by `bullets_needed`, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `i` is incremented by 1, and `success` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `success` is False, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `i` is 4, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `success` remains False, `bullets_needed` equals `health`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` equals `distance`, `i` is 5, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
