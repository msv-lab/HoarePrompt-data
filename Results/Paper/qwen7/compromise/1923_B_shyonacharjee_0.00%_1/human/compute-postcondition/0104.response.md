Postcondition: `success` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `position` is `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `time_available` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `bullets_needed` is `monsters[i][1]`, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the total bullets used plus the bullets needed exceed the time available.
