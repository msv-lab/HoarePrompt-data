Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\) and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input after `t`, `k` is the second integer input after `t`.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state as an input integer within the specified range.
