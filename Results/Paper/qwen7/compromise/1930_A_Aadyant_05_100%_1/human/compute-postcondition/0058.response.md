Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `list2` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `final` is a list containing one element which is `s`, `num` is incremented by 1, `a` is an input string, `list1` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `list1` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `b`, `list2`, `s`, `final`, `num`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values and states.
