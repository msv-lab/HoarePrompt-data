Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for str in list1:`. The variables involved here are `str` and `list1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `str` is a variable that will take each word from `list1` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `list1` is a list of words from the string `b`.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `list1` contains at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `list1` is derived from the string `b`, we need to ensure that `list1` has at least one word.
   - The value of `str` will change in each iteration, but initially, it doesn't matter what its value is because the loop will start with the first element of `list1`.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `list1` must contain at least one word (derived from `b`).
- `str` will be set to the first element of `list1` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`b` is an input string, `list2` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `final` is a list containing one element which is `s`, `num` is incremented by 1, `a` is an input string, `list1` is a list of words from the string `b` that must have at least one word**
