Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string, list1 is a list of strings with one less element than before, list2 is a list with one element which is the integer representation of the first string in the updated list1**.

Explanation: The code appends the integer representation of the first element of the updated list1 to list2. Since the first element of list1 is the first string in the original list1 (which now has one less element), list2 will contain the integer representation of that string. The other variables remain unchanged.
