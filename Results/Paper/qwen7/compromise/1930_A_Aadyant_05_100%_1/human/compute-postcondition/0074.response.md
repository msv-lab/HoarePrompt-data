Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `s` is the original value of `s` plus the integer value of the fourth element of `list2`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 2 each iteration (`i += 2`).
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < len(list2)`.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

5. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5`.

6. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(list2)`.
   - Therefore, `len(list2)` must be greater than 5.

7. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The variable `i` will be updated to 5.
   - The condition for `len(list2)` must be such that it allows the loop to continue.

8. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is now 5.
   - `s` remains unchanged from the previous iteration (it is the original value of `s` plus the integer value of the fourth element of `list2`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 5, `s` is the original value of `s` plus the integer value of the fourth element of `list2`, and `len(list2)` must be greater than 5**.
