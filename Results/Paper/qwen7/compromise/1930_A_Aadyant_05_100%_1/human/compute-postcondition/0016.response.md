Output State: **`list2` is sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `list2.sort()` sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num`, `s`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
