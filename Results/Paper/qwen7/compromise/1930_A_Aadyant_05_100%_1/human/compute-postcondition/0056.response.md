Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `list2` is an empty list, `s` is 0, `final` is a list containing one element which is `s`, `num` is incremented by 1, `int(n)` remains the same**.

The code `list2 = []` assigns an empty list to `list2`. This changes the state of `list2` from being a sorted list to being an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
