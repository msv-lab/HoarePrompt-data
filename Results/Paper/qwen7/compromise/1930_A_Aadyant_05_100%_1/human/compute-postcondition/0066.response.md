Output State: **`b` is an input string, `list2` is [int(a), int(str)], `s` is 0, `final` is [0], `num` is incremented by 1, `a` is an input string, `list1` is a list of words from the string `b` that must have at least one word remaining.**

Explanation: The code appends `int(str)` to `list2`. Since `str` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be the same as `a` (an input string). Therefore, `list2` changes from `[int(a)]` to `[int(a), int(a)]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
