Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `list2` is a sorted list, `s` is the original value of `s` plus the integer value of the element at index `i` in `list2`.**

Explanation: The code `s = s + int(list2[i])` adds the integer value of the element at index `i` in `list2` to the current value of `s`. Since `list2` is a sorted list and `b` is a non-empty string, their states remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to include the integer value of the element from `list2` at index `i`.
