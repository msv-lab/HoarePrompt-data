Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `no` will be set to `False`, and the loop will have checked each character in `c` against `a` and `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in either `a` or `b`, the loop will break and `no` will be set to `False`. If no such character is found, `no` remains `True`.**

This means that if the loop completes without finding any character in `c` that is not present in either `a` or `b`, `no` will still be `True`. However, as soon as the loop finds a character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b`, it will print 'YES', set `no` to `False`, and exit the loop.
