Output State: **`no` is False, `x` will take on the values of the elements in `c`, `c` must contain at least one element, tests must be greater than `len(c) + 1`. The current value of `x` is not in `a` and not in `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `no`, `x`, `c`, `tests`, `a`, or `b`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
