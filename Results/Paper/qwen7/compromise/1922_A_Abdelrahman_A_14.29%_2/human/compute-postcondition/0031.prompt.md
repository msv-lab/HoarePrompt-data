Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input value from the user, `c` is an input value from the user, `no` is True, and `c` is neither equal to `a` nor equal to `b`
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a and x not in b:
        print('YES')
        no = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `c` must contain at least one element, and if `x` is not found in both `a` and `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` must contain at least one element, and `x` is an element in `c`; if `x` is not in `a` and not in `b`, `no` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `c` must contain at least one element, and `x` will be the next element in `c`. If `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, then `no` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `x` is in `a` or `x` is in `b`, then no changes are made to `no` and the program continues as normal.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
