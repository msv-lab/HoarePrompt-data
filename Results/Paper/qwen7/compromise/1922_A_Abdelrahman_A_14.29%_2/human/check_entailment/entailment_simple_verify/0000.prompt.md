You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:

    #State: Output State: `tests` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed (which is the value of `tests`), `slength` remains the same as the initial input integer, `a` remains the same as the last input string, `b` remains the same as the last input string, `c` remains the same as the last input string, and `no` will be `False` if any character in `c` is found in either `a` or `b`. If no character in `c` is found in both `a` and `b`, then `no` will remain `True`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `tests` will hold the final value it had after the last iteration, `i` will reflect the total number of iterations (`tests`), and `no` will indicate whether there was any character in `c` that was not present in either `a` or `b` during any of the iterations. The values of `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be those provided in the last set of inputs processed by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if `c` contains any character that is not present in either `a` or `b`. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- `a` and `b` both consist entirely of lowercase letters, so they would match a template like "aa" or "bb".
- `c` contains the character 'b', which is also present in `b`, but it also contains 'a', which is present in `a`.

In this case, the program would incorrectly print "YES" because it only checks if `c` contains any character not in `a` or `b`, without ensuring that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to check for each character in the template and ensure that the conditions for matching `a` and `b` while not matching `c` are met.
