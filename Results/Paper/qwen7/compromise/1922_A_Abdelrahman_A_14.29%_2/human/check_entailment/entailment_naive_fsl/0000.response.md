Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if `c` contains any character that is not present in either `a` or `b`. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- `a` and `b` both consist entirely of lowercase letters, so they would match a template like "aa" or "bb".
- `c` contains the character 'b', which is also present in `b`, but it also contains 'a', which is present in `a`.

In this case, the program would incorrectly print "YES" because it only checks if `c` contains any character not in `a` or `b`, without ensuring that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to check for each character in the template and ensure that the conditions for matching `a` and `b` while not matching `c` are met.
