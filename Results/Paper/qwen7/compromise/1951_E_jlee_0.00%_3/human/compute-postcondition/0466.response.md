Output: **string[:4], string[4:]**

Explanation:
- `j` is given as 4.
- `string` is a sequence (list or string) that we need to split.
- `string[:j]` refers to the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the index `j`, which is `string[:4]`.
- `string[j:]` refers to the substring starting from index `j` to the end of `string`, which is `string[4:]`.

Since the exact content of `string` is not provided, we describe it in terms of the slice notation used in the print statement.
