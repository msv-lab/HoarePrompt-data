Postcondition: `j` is 3, `n` is at least 7, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is greater than 0, `done` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, then `count2` is either equal to `count` if `count` is greater than 1, or `count2` is greater than `count` or not equal to `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is 1.
