Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is 2, `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, `done` is set to True, `count` is greater than 1, the current value of `s[j]` equals `x`, and `count2` equals `count`.**

Explanation: The line `done = True` simply updates the value of the variable `done` to `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, `s[0]`, `s[1]`, `count`, `s[j]`, and `count2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
