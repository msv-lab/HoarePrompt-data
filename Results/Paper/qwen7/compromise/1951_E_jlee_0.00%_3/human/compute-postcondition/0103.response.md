Output: **string (where string is an undefined variable or object)**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided, `j` is 1 and `n` is 2. However, there is no definition or assignment for the `string` variable in the given initial state. Therefore, when the `print(string)` statement is executed, it will attempt to print the value of `string`, which is undefined. Since the value of `string` is not explicitly provided, the output will simply be the placeholder `string`.
