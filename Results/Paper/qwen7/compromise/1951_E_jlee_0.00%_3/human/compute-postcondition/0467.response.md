Output State: **`j` is 4, `n` is at least 7, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is 4, `done` is set to True.**

Explanation: The code `done = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `done`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, `s[j]`, `x`, `count`, and the condition `if s[j] is not equal to s[n - 1 - j]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
