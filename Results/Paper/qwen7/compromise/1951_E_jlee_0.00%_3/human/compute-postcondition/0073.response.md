Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `n` is 2.
   - `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`.
   - `done` is set to `True`.
   - `count` is greater than 1.
   - The current value of `s[j]` equals `x`.
   - `count2` equals `count`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `j` is 0, `string[:j - 1]` will be `string[: -1]`, which is an empty string because `j - 1` is `-1` and slicing from the start to `-1` results in an empty slice.
   - `string[j - 1:]` will be `string[-1:]`, which is a substring starting from the last character of `string`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will output an empty string followed by the last character of `string`.

Given this analysis, the output will be:

Output: **'', string[-1]**
