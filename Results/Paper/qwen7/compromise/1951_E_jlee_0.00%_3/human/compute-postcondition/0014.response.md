Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string from the user.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s`, which is currently 2.
- `done` is True.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- The current value of `x` is not equal to the last element of the list `s`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables since it does not depend on any of them.

Output: **YES**
