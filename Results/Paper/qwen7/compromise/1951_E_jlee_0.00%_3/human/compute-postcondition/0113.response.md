Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 2
- `done` is set to `True`

The code snippet is:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to know the value of `string`. Since `string` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, let's assume `string` is a placeholder for any string value. For the sake of this example, let's consider `string` to be "example".

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `string[:j]` means slicing `string` from the start up to but not including the index `j`. Since `j` is 1, it will take the substring from the start to index 1.
2. `string[j:]` means slicing `string` starting from index `j` to the end. Since `j` is 1, it will take the substring from index 1 to the end.

Assuming `string = "example"`:
- `string[:1]` will be `"e"`
- `string[1:]` will be `"xample"`

Therefore, the print statement will output these two substrings separated by a space.

Output: **"e xample"**
