Postcondition: `j` is 3 and `n` must be at least 7. If `s[j]` (which is `s[3]`) is not equal to `x`, then `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Since there are no other changes when `s[j]` equals `x`, the values of `j`, `n`, `s`, `x`, and `done` remain unchanged.
