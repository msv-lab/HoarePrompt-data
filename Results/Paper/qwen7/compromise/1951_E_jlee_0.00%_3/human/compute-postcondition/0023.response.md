Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` which is currently 2, `done` is True, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, and the count of `x` in the list `s` is equal to 2. We continue the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but instead moves the control to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the current block. Therefore, all the previous values remain the same.
