Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is 0, and `count2` is equal to `count`.**

Explanation: The line `count2 = 0` sets the value of `count2` to 0. All other variables retain their previous states as per the initial conditions.
