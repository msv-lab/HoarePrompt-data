Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 4.
- `n` is at least 7.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count` is 4.
- `done` is set to `True`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the following code snippet:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

Let's break it down:

1. `string[:j - 1]` will slice the string from the start up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`. Since `j` is 4, this becomes `string[:3]`.

2. `string[j - 1:]` will slice the string starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end. Since `j` is 4, this becomes `string[3:]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the substring from the start of the string up to the third character, followed by the substring from the fourth character to the end of the string.

Output: **string[:3] string[3:]**
