Output: **YES**

Explanation: According to the initial state provided, the variables `j`, `n`, and `done` have specific values: `j` is 1, `n` is 2, and `done` is set to True. The code snippet does not depend on the values of `s` or `x`, and it directly prints "YES". Since no conditions are met that would change this print statement, the output will be "YES".
