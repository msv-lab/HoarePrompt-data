Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is 2, and `done` is True. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `j`, `n`, and `done` remain unchanged. If `count2` equals `count`, then the values of `j`, `n`, and `done` remain unchanged. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `count` remains unchanged. If `count` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged, and `count2` is 0.
