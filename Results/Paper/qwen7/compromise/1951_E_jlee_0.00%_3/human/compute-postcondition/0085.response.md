Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0
- `n` is 2
- `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`
- `done` is set to True
- `count` is greater than 0
- The current value of `s[j]` equals `x`
- `count2` is greater than `count`

The `print(string[:j], string[j:])` statement will split the string `string` at index `j`.

Given that `j` is 0, the slice `string[:j]` will be an empty string (`""`), and `string[j:]` will be the entire string `string`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'', string**
