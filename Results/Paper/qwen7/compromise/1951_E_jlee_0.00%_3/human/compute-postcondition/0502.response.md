Output State: **`j` is 4, `n` is greater than 7, `count` is 4, `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values related to `s[j]` and `x` also remain as they were, and the `done` variable is not affected by the `continue` statement. Therefore, the output state includes all the original variables and their values as they were in the initial state.
