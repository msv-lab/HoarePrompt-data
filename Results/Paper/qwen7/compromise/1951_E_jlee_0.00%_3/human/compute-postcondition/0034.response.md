Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string from the user.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s`, which is currently 2.
- `done` is True.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `s.count(x)` is equal to 1.
- `(n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x)` is False.

The print statement is simply `print(1)`. Since there are no variables or expressions being evaluated within the print statement, it will directly print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
