Postcondition: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, `count` is 3, `count2` is 0.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the if condition is met (i.e., `done` is False), the final state of the variables remains as specified in the if part, with `done` being set to True.
