Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` which is currently 2, `done` is True, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, and the current value of `x` is not equal to the last element of the list `s`. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop continues, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
