Postcondition: **`done` is True, `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and either `count2` is 0 or `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. If `count2` is greater than `count`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, no change is made to the variables.**
