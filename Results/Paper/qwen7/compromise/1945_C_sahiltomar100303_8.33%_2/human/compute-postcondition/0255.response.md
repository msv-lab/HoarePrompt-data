Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus 1, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `right` is `mid` plus 1, `trightOne` is now equal to `trightOne - 1`, `tleftOne` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decrements the value of `trightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `trightOne` is updated to its previous value minus 1, while the rest of the variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
