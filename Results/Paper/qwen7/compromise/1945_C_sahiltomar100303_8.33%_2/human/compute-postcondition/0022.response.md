Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(mid)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `i` is 0 and `mid` is a positive integer (n // 2).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < mid`. Since `i` starts at 0 and `mid` is a positive integer, the loop will execute once.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**: After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1. The value of `mid` remains unchanged because it is a positive integer (n // 2) and does not change within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `mid`. Given that `i` is now 1 and `mid` is still a positive integer (n // 2), the loop can execute again if `mid` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration should reflect that `i` is 1 and `mid` must be greater than 1.

**State: **`i` is 1, `mid` must be greater than 1**
