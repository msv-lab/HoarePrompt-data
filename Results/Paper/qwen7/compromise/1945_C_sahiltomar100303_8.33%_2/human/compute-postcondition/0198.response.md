Output State: **`rightOne` is increased by 2, `i` is `mid + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` was initially increased by 1, it is now increased by 2. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as no operations affecting them were performed.
