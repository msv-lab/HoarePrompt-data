Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1`, and `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1`. `rightZero` is the count of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string, and `rightOne` is the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string. `left` is assigned the value of `mid`.**

In this case, the variable `left` is assigned the value of `mid`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
