Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `leftOne` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `right` is `mid` plus the number of iterations the loop executed, and the values of `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted according to the characters encountered during each iteration of the loop. The condition `right != n` is true.**
