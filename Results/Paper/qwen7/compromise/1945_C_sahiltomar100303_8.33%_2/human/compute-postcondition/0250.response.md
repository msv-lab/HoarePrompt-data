Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus 1, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `right` is `mid` plus 1, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of the remaining length of the string.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` was equal to `mid`. After the increment, `right` becomes `mid + 1`. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, and the condition about `rightOne` being less than or equal to half of the remaining length of the string remain unchanged. The value of `rightZero` is updated to reflect one less zero from the substring starting at `left` to `n-1`.
