Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `leftOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the condition for updating `leftZero` and `leftOne` based on the value of `s[mid]` is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `leftOne` is increased by 1.
