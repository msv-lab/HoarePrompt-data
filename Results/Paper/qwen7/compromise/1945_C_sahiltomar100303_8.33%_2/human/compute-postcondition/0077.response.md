Output State: **`leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`**.

This means that the variable `leftOne` has been decremented by 1, while the conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged from the initial state.
