Output State: **`left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` was '0', otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 1 and `s[left - 1]` is not '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is decremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations minus 2. The conditions for `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged as the code only affects `left`.
