Output State: **`left` is `left - 1`, `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1`, or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `left -= 1` decreases the value of `left` by 1. The conditions for `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged because the code does not affect them directly. Therefore, the updated state of `left` is `left - 1`, while the conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain as they were initially stated.
