Output State: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` is the total number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1` multiplied by 2, `rightOne` is the total number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1` multiplied by 2, `left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are unchanged, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are unchanged, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are unchanged, `right` is `mid`.**

Explanation: The variable `right` is assigned the value of `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. The value of `left` is already 0, and the loop conditions and updates to `rightZero`, `rightOne`, and the other variables are not altered by this line of code.
