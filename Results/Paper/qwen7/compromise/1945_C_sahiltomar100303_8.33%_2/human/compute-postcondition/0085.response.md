Output State: **`left` must be at least 1, and (`leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`); `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. The conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged because the code only affects `leftOne`. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `leftOne` and retains the original conditions related to `leftZero` and `rightOne`.
