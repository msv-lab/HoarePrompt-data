Postcondition: `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1` and must be less than half of `mid + 1`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string, `rightOne` is the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string and must be less than half of `n - mid + 1`, `left` is assigned the value of `mid`, `s[left - 1]` is not equal to '0'
