Output State: **`left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than (left + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Since `leftZero` was initially such that either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`, the condition involving `leftZero` remains true after decrementing it by 1. The value of `left` remains unchanged as it was only mentioned to be greater than 0.
