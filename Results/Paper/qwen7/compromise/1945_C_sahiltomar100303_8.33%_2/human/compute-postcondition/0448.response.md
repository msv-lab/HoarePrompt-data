Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` and is not equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is updated based on the number of '0's encountered from the initial `right` to the end of the string, `trightZero` is updated based on the number of '0's encountered from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right`, `trightOne` is updated based on the number of '1's encountered from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right`, `tleftOne` is updated based on the number of '1's encountered from the initial `right` to the end of the string, and `left` is not equal to 0, and `(abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) > abs((n + 1) // 2 - right))`**
