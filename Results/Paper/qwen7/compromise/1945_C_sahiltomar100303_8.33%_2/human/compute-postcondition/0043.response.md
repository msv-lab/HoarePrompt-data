Output State: **`i` is equal to `mid-1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid-1`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid-1`, and `rightOne` is the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string, incremented by 1.**

The code increments `rightOne` by 1, which means the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string has been updated. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
