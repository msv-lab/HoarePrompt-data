Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 1, `tleftZero` is unchanged, `trightZero` is unchanged, `trightOne` is unchanged, `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. Since `tleftOne` was previously unchanged, it now has its value increased by 1. All other variables remain in their initial state.
