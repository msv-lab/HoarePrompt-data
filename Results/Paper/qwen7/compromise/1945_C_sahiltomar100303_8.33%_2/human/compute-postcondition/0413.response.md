Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 2, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are updated based on the value at `s[right]`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Since `right` was originally an index within the string `s` plus 1, after executing the code, `right` becomes an index within the string `s` plus 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
