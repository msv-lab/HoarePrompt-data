Output State: **`left` is greater than 0 and `leftZero` is equal to `leftZero` - 1, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1. Since `left` must be greater than 0 and the condition involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` must still hold true, the updated state reflects these changes while maintaining the original conditions.
