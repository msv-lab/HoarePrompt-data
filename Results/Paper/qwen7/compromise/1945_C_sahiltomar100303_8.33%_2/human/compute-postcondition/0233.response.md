Output State: **`left` is greater than 0; `leftZero` is such that either `leftZero < (left) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The conditions involving `leftZero` remain unchanged as no operations affecting `leftZero` are performed. The value of `left` remains greater than 0 as no operations affecting `left` are performed.
