Output State: **`leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`, and (`leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`).**

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The condition involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remains unchanged because the code only modifies `rightZero`. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `rightZero` and retains the original condition.
