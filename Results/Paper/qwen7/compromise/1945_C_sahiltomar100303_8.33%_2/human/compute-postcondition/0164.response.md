Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `leftZero` is increased by 2**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `n` must be greater than 0 and `leftZero` is increased by 1. The code snippet `tleftZero += 1` increases the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was already increased by 1 in the initial state, now it is increased by another 1, making it increased by 2 in total. Therefore, `leftZero` is increased by 2, while the condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
