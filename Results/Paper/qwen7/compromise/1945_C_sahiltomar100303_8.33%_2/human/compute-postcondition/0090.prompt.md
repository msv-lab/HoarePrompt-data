Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `leftMove` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1`, and `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string, and `rightOne` is the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string, `left` is assigned the value of `mid`.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `leftMove` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (either decreased by 1 or unchanged), `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1' or unchanged if `s[left - 1]` is '0'), `rightZero` is the count of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0' or unchanged if `s[left - 1]` is '1'), `rightOne` is the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (unchanged if `s[left - 1]` is '0' or increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1'), `left` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`, and the character at `left - 1` in `s` is either '0' or '1'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`; `left` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `left` is `left - 1`, and the condition remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
