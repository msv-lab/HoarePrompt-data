Output State: **`leftZero` is updated according to the value of `s[left - 2]`, `rightZero` is updated according to the value of `s[left - 2]`, `left` is decreased by 1, either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The line `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. The conditions for updating `leftZero` and `rightZero` depend on the value of `s[left - 1]`, which now corresponds to `s[left - 2]` after the decrement. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` must still hold true.
