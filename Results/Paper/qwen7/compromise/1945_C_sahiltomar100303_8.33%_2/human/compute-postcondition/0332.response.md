Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 3**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` was initially set to 2 based on the condition `if s[2] is '0', then leftZero is 2`. After executing `leftZero += 1`, `leftZero` is incremented by 1, making its value 3. The other variables (`i` and `mid`) remain unchanged.
