Based on the initial state provided:

- `leftMove` is 6.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `mid` remains as `n // 2`.
- `s` is the input string.
- `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged).
- `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged).
- `rightZero` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged).
- `rightOne` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged).
- `left` is `mid - 3`.
- `right` is `n - 1`.
- `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`.
- `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`.
- `left` is not equal to 0.
- `right` is not equal to `n`.
- The absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `right`.

We need to determine the value of `left` which is defined as `mid - 3`.

Given that `mid` is `n // 2`, the value of `left` is `n // 2 - 3`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we express `left` in terms of `n`.

Output: **n // 2 - 3**
