Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is explicitly given as 0.
- `right` is set to `mid` plus the number of iterations the loop executed, and it is mentioned that `right == n`.
- The values of `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `right`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` are not directly relevant to the `print(left)` statement since it only prints the value of `left`.

Given that `left` is explicitly stated to be 0, the print statement will simply output this value.

Output: **0**
