Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1`, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`, `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged. Therefore, `left` must still be greater than 0, `leftZero` must still be less than half of `left + 1`, and `leftOne` remains `leftOne - 1`. The new value of `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`.
