Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 inclusive. The value of `n` and `a` remain as they were in the initial state.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `leftMove` is 6, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged), `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged), `rightZero` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged), `rightOne` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged), `left` is `mid - 3`, `right` is `n - 1`, `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`. If `left` is 0, and `right` is not equal to `n`, the current state remains unchanged. If `right` is not equal to `n`, and `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, or the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `right`, or the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `n + 1` divided by 2 and `right`, then `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. If `left` is 0 and `right` is equal to `n`, and `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, then `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than `(n + 1) // 2` and `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `leftOne` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `right` is `mid` plus the number of iterations the loop executed, and the values of `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted according to the characters encountered during each iteration of the loop. If `right` equals `n`, then either `trightZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` (in which case `trightZero` remains unchanged) or `rightOne` is less than half of `n + 1`. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2` if `right` is not equal to `n`, and `right` is greater than `n` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` and is equal to `n`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` are updated based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right` and from the initial `right` to the end of the string. If `right` is equal to `n`, the updates to `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` are based on the number of '0's and '1's from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right` and from the initial `right` to the end of the string. If the number of '1's from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the values of `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged. If `right` is not equal to `n`, the updates to `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and `tleftOne` are based on the number of '0's and '1's from the initial `right` to the end of the string and from the start of the string up to but not including the initial `right`. The absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is compared to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
