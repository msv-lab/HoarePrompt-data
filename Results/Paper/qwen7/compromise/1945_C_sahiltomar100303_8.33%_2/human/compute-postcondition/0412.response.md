Postcondition: `s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 1, `tleftZero` and `tleftOne` are updated based on the value at `s[right]`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.
