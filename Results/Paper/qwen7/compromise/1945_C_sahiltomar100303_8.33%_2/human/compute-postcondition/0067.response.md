Output State: **`leftZero` is now `leftZero - 1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string plus 1, `rightOne` is the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string and must be less than half of `n - mid + 1`, `left` is assigned the value of `mid`, and the current value of `left` is `mid`. Additionally, the character at `left - 1` in `s` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code increments `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial condition that `rightZero` is the count of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string is updated to include one more '0'.
