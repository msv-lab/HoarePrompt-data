Output State: **`i` is 1; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftOne` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is not defined in the initial state, so it is assumed to be a typo and should be `leftOne`. The code `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. Given that `leftOne` was initially 1, after executing this line, `leftOne` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
