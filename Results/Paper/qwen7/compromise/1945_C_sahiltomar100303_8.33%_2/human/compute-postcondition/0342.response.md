Output State: **`s` is a string, the index `i` points to a character in `s` which is '0', `rightZero` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Initially, `rightZero` was not specified, but since no initial value was given, we assume it started as 0. After executing `rightZero += 1`, `rightZero` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
