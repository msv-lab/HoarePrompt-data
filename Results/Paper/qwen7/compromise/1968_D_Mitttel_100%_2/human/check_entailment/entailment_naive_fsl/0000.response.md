Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game." Specifically, the `func_1` function does not accurately simulate the game's rules for both players. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**: The `func_1` function only considers the score for one player (the player starting at position `s`). However, the game involves two players making simultaneous moves, and the scores should be calculated for both players.

2. **Single Player Simulation**: The function simulates the moves for a single player indefinitely until `k` moves are made or the player cannot move further. This approach does not account for the simultaneous nature of the game, where both players must choose their moves independently.

3. **No Simultaneous Moves**: The function does not handle the scenario where both players could potentially move to different positions based on their current positions and the permutation array. It only considers the moves for one player at a time.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  - Bodya starts at position 3.
  - Sasha starts at position 2.
  - After the first turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(5\) (since \(a_3 = 5\)).
    - Bodya moves to position 3 (stays).
    - Sasha's score: \(2\) (since \(a_2 = 2\)).
    - Sasha moves to position 1 (stays).
  - After the second turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(5 + 5 = 10\) (since \(a_3 = 5\)).
    - Sasha's score: \(2 + 7 = 9\) (since \(a_1 = 7\)).

- **Actual Output**:
  - The provided code only calculates the score for one player (Bodya) and does not simulate Sasha's moves or compare the final scores of both players.

Since the program does not correctly simulate the game for both players and does not compare their scores, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
