### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb` (Bodya's starting position), `ps` (Sasha's starting position), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
   - It adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based by subtracting 1 from each element.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha, passing the necessary parameters. This function is responsible for calculating the maximum possible score for a given starting position.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes variables to keep track of the maximum score (`mx`), the current score (`cur`), and a visited array (`vis`) to avoid revisiting positions.
   - It iteratively updates the score and moves through the permutation until it either runs out of moves (`k <= 0`) or visits all positions.
   - The function returns the maximum score achievable from the given starting position.

4. **Score Comparison**:
   - After calculating the scores for both players using `func_1`, the program compares the scores.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If Bodya's score is greater, it prints 'Bodya'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Sasha'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the scores are equal by printing 'Draw'.
   - It correctly identifies when Bodya has a higher score and when Sasha has a higher score.
   - The logic for determining the winner is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the original assessment, I notice a minor discrepancy in the initialization of the `vis` array. Specifically, the annotation states:
```python
vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
```
However, the actual code initializes `vis` as follows:
```python
vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
```
This is a typographical error in the annotation, but it does not affect the functionality of the program since both lines initialize a list of `n` zeros.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all cases appropriately, the program is indeed correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct as it accurately calculates the maximum possible scores for both players and determines the winner based on these scores.
