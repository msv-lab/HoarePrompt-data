Output State: **`mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `k` must be greater than 0, `s[0]` must not be equal to `s`, `vis[s]` is 1, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += a[s]` increments the value of `cur` by `a[s]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
