Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: an array `a` of integers, a permutation `p` of integers from 1 to `n`, a list `s` of integers representing starting positions, and a non-negative integer `k`. It iterates through the permutation based on the starting positions until `k` becomes zero or all positions are visited. During each iteration, it updates the current sum `cur` and the maximum value `mx`. After completing the iterations, it returns the maximum value between 0 and the final value of `cur + 0 * a[s]`, with a list `vis` marking all visited positions in the permutation `p` as 1 and the rest as 0.**
