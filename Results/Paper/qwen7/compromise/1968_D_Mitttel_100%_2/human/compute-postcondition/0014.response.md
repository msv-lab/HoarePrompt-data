Output State: **`k` is decreased by 1, `mx` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`, `k` must be greater than 0, `s[0]` must not be equal to `s`, `vis[s]` is 1, `cur` is increased by `a[s]`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state. The precondition that `k` must be greater than 0, `s[0]` must not be equal to `s`, `vis[s]` is 1, and `cur` is increased by `a[s]` are still valid. The update to `mx` remains conditional on the current value of `mx` and the expression `cur + k * a[s]`.
