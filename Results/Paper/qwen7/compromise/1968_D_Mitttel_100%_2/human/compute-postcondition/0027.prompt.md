You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array a, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, s is a list of integers representing the starting positions P_B and P_S, and k is a non-negative integer representing the duration of the game.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: Output State: `k` is `0`, `mx` is the maximum value between its previous value and `cur + k * a[s]` after all iterations, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `s` is the final position in the permutation after all iterations, `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` for all iterations, `vis` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `1` at the indices visited during the iterations and `0` elsewhere.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `k` will be `0` because the loop condition `k > 0` will no longer be satisfied. The variable `mx` will hold the maximum value between its initial value (0) and the cumulative value of `cur + k * a[s]` after all iterations. The list `vis` will mark all visited positions in the permutation `p` with `1`, and the rest will remain `0`. The variables `n`, `a`, `p`, `s`, and `cur` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the cumulative value of cur + 0 * a[s] after all iterations, with the list vis marking all visited positions in the permutation p with 1 and the rest as 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: a (a list of integers), p (a permutation of integers from 1 to n), s (a list of integers representing starting positions), and k (a non-negative integer). It returns the maximum value between 0 and the cumulative value of cur + 0 * a[s] after all iterations, with the list vis marking all visited positions in the permutation p with 1 and the rest as 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value between 0 and the cumulative value of cur + 0 * a[s] after all iterations, with the list vis marking all visited positions in the permutation p with 1 and the rest as 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
