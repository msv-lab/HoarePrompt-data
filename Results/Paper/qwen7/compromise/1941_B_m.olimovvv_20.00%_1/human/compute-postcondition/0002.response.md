Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, if the first element of the list `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of the list `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.
