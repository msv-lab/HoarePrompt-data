Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking two specific conditions related to the first and last elements of the array. However, these conditions do not fully capture the necessary criteria for making all elements of the array zero using the given operations. Specifically, the program only checks the parity (odd/even) of the first and last elements and their relationship with adjacent elements, which is insufficient to determine if the entire array can be reduced to zeros.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the total sum of the array elements is even, because each operation reduces three elements by a total of 4 (1+2+1). Additionally, the difference between consecutive elements must allow for the operations to balance out the array values. The current implementation does not check these broader conditions.

Given the execution summary, the program's logic is flawed and does not correctly determine if all elements can be made zero. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
