Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) for each t. It returns different outputs based on the values of t and the sequence of a_i.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any direct parameters. Instead, it processes input through a series of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` (ranging from 1 to 100) and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each ranging from 1 to 100). The function then returns different outputs based on the values of `t` and the sequence of `a_i`.
