You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of multiple lines, each corresponding to one test case. For each test case, if \( b \leq a \), the output is \( a \times n \). Otherwise, the output is \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k + (n - k) \times a\), where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \).
    #
    #This means for each test case, the output will either be the product of \( a \) and \( n \) if \( b \) is less than or equal to \( a \), or a more complex calculation involving \( a \), \( b \), and \( n \) otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. It does not return anything explicitly but performs operations based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
