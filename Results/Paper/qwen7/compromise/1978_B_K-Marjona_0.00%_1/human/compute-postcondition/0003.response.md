Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. It does not return anything explicitly but performs operations based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases (indicated by `t`), and for each test case, it takes three positive integers (`n`, `a`, and `b`) as inputs. However, since no specific return statement is mentioned, it implies the function might perform some operations or print results without returning a value.
