Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers `a`. It then creates a string `r` consisting of 26 lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z'), where each letter's position corresponds to the count of its index value in the list `a`. After processing all test cases, it prints the resulting strings `r` for each case.**
