Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `k` such that 2 <= k <= 100. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a number from the list `arr`, and its value is capped at `k`. If a number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its value in `frequency_table` will be `k`; otherwise, it will be the actual count of the number in `arr`.**
