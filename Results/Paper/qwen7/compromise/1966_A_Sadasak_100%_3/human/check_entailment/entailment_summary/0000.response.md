Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the specified operations.
2. The operations allow exchanging `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` new cards.
3. The solution logic seems to focus on the frequency of each card number and how many such exchanges can be made.
4. The provided code includes a function `func_1` that correctly counts the frequency of each card number but caps this frequency at `k`.
5. In the main loop, the program checks if `k` itself is a value in the frequency table returned by `func_1`. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints the total number of cards `n`.
6. This approach is flawed because:
   - The frequency counting part is correct.
   - However, the logic to determine the minimum number of remaining cards is incorrect. The presence of `k` in the frequency values does not directly imply the minimum number of cards.
   - The program should consider the total number of cards and how they can be reduced through exchanges, not just check for the presence of `k` in the frequency values.
7. A correct approach would involve calculating the remainder when the total count of each card type is divided by `k` and summing these remainders.

Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
