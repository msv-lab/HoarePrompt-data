### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure we understand why it is incorrect and what needs to be fixed.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly limits the frequency of any card to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem.

2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Cards:**
   - The logic of checking if `k` is in the values of the frequency dictionary and printing `k - 1` is flawed. This approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left.

#### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly:
1. Calculate the frequency of each card number.
2. Determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed.
3. Calculate the remaining cards after performing the maximum possible exchanges.

#### Corrected Program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Calculate the frequency of each card number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1

    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += (count // k) * (k - 1)
    
    # Add the remaining cards that cannot form a complete group of k
    min_cards += sum(count % k for count in freq.values())

    print(min_cards)
```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the frequency of each card number using a dictionary.

3. **Finding Minimum Cards:**
   - The program iterates over the values in the frequency dictionary.
   - For each count, it calculates how many complete groups of `k` cards can be formed and adds `(count // k) * (k - 1)` to `min_cards`.
   - It then adds the remaining cards that cannot form a complete group of `k` by summing `count % k` for each count.

This approach ensures that the program correctly determines the minimum number of cards that can be left after performing the maximum possible exchanges.

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed frequency calculation and logic for determining the minimum number of cards. The corrected program accurately implements the required logic.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
