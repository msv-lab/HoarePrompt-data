Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is len(`unique_chars`) - 1**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `i` and `j`. Variable `i` is assigned the value 0, and variable `j` is assigned the value `len(unique_chars) - 1`. The length of `unique_chars` remains unchanged, and it is still a list of sorted unique characters from `s`.
