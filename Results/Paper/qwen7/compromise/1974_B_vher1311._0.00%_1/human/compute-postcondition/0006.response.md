Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It first identifies all unique characters in `s`, sorts them, and then replaces each character in `s` with the last unique character found. After processing, if no unique characters remain, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it returns the modified string with replaced characters.**
