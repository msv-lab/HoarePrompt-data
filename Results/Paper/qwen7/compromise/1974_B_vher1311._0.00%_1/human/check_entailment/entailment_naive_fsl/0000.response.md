Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. The function `func_1` is intended to decode the string, but it does not properly handle the decoding process. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to encode a string, not decode it. It replaces characters in the input string `s` with characters from the sorted unique characters list, which is the opposite of what is required for decoding.

To decode the string, we need to map each character in the encoded string back to its corresponding character in the auxiliary string `r`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode_string(s):
    # Step 1: Construct the auxiliary string r
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    
    # Step 2: Create a mapping from characters in r to their symmetric positions
    mapping = {char: unique_chars[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    
    # Step 3: Decode the string
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

This corrected program first constructs the auxiliary string `r` and then creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart. Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string. This approach ensures that the program correctly decodes the string according to the problem description.
