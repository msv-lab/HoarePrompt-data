Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets purchased on a day affects the price of tickets on subsequent days. Specifically, the program does not account for the increase in ticket prices correctly after purchasing tickets on a given day.

For example, consider the following input:
- `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`
- `a = [1, 3, 8, 4]`

The correct approach would be:
1. On day 1, buy 2 tickets (since `m = 2`), which costs `2 * 1 = 2`. Now, the prices for the next days are `[4, 8, 4]`.
2. On day 2, buy 1 ticket, which costs `1 * 4 = 4`. Now, the prices for the next days are `[8, 4]`.
3. On day 3, buy 0 tickets, so the prices remain `[8, 4]`.
4. On day 4, buy 0 tickets, so the final price is still `[8, 4]`.

The total cost should be `2 + 4 = 6`.

However, the provided program calculates the cost incorrectly. It sorts the array and then tries to distribute the tickets across the days without properly accounting for the increase in prices. This leads to an incorrect total cost calculation.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`
- `a = [1, 3, 8, 4]`
- Expected output: `6`
- Program output: Incorrect value due to improper handling of ticket price increases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
