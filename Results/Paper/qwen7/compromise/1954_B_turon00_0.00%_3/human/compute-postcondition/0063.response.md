Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. Since `ans` is defined as the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is now 0, `ans` remains unchanged (assuming the previous value of `ans` was greater than or equal to 0). The values of `i` and `n` remain unaffected.
