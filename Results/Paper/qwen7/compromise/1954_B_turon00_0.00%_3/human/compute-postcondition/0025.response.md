Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list that is 1 more than the previous value of `i`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt` if the condition `a[i] == tmp` is true. If the condition `a[i] == tmp` is false, `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` remains unchanged.
