Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the minimum value between its initial value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` will be its initial value.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, meaning `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
- `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `t` is `t - 1`.

The `print(-1)` statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
