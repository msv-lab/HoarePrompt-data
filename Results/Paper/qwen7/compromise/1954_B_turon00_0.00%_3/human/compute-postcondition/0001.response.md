Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state is given as `t` being assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `range(t)`, which means the loop will run `t` times.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop will run `t` times, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range.
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop execution directly. It is used to iterate over the range `range(t)`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
