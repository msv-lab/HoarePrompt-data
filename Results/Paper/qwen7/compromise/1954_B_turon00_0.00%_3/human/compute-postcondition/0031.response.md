Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 4, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index 4 in list `a` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and either 1 (if the element at index 4 equals `tmp`) or 0 (if the element at index 4 does not equal `tmp`).
