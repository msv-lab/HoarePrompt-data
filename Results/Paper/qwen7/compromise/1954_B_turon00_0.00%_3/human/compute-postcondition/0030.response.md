Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is 4, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and 0.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` sets the value of `cnt` to 0. Since `cnt` was previously equal to 0 or 1 depending on whether the element at index 4 in list `a` equals `tmp`, setting `cnt` to 0 ensures that `cnt` is now explicitly 0. The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`, which is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
