Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, and the first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`. Since `i` and `n` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The first element of `a` and `tmp` also remain unchanged.
