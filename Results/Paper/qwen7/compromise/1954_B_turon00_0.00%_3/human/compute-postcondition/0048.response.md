Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` has a specific value such that `a[i]` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1, but since the initial value of `cnt` is not specified, we only know that it has been incremented. The values of `i`, `n`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
