Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `ans` is the minimum value between its initial value and `cnt`.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
   - `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`.
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`.

2. **Determine the Value of `ans`**:
   - Since `cnt` is 0, the initial value of `ans` must be 0 because it is the minimum value between its initial value and `cnt`.
   - Therefore, `ans` is 0.

3. **Print Statement Execution**:
   - The print statement is `print(ans)`.
   - Given that `ans` is 0, the print statement will output 0.

Output: **0**
