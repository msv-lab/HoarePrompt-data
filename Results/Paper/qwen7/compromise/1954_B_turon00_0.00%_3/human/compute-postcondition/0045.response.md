Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is an input integer.
   - `n` is the length of the range function, which means it is an integer representing the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we don't need to adjust it initially.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables mentioned but not directly involved in the loop head**:
   - `ans`: Updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.
   - `tmp`: Equal to `a[0]`.
   - `cnt`: Initially 0.
   - `aa`: A set containing all unique elements from the list `a`.
   - `ans`: Initially `n`.

Given these points, the only variables that need adjustment for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
