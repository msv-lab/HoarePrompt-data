Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`, which is now 0.
