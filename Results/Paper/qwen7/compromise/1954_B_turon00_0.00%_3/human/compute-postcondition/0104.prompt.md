Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The precondition that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 remains valid.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    aa = set(a)
    if len(aa) == 1:
        print(-1)
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, and `cnt` remains the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is the minimum value between its initial value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, and `n` is the length of the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`; `cnt` is reset to 0; `tmp` remains equal to `a[0]`; the set `aa` contains all unique elements from the list `a`; variable `n` remains as the input integer; `t` is `t - i - 1` where `i` is `n - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
