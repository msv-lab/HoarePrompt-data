Postcondition: `ans` is the minimum of its current value (which is `n`), `cnt + 1` if `a[i] == tmp`, and 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `cnt` is either 2, 1, or 0; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from input; `t` is `t - 1`; `i` is `i + 1`; and `a[i]` is either equal to `tmp` or not equal to `tmp`.
