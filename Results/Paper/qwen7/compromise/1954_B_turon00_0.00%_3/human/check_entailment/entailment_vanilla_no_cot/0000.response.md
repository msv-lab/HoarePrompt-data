Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it non-beautiful. The solution checks if all elements are the same and if not, it counts consecutive elements equal to the first element, which does not address the core requirement of making the array non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Create a dictionary to count occurrences of each element
        count_dict = {}
        for num in a:
            if num in count_dict:
                count_dict[num] += 1
            else:
                count_dict[num] = 1
        
        # Find the most frequent element
        max_count = max(count_dict.values())
        
        # If all elements are the same, return -1
        if max_count == n:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Otherwise, calculate the minimum number of removals needed
        min_removals = n - max_count
        print(min_removals)

# Example usage:
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Count Occurrences**: We use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
2. **Find Most Frequent Element**: We find the maximum count of any element in the array.
3. **Check All Elements Same**: If the maximum count is equal to the length of the array, it means all elements are the same, and it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. Hence, we print `-1`.
4. **Calculate Removals**: Otherwise, the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is `n - max_count`.

This approach ensures that the solution correctly identifies whether it's possible to make the array non-beautiful and calculates the minimum number of removals needed.
