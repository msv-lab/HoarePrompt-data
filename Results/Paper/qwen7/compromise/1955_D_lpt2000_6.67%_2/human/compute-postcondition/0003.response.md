Output State: **`nabors` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input, `aa` is a list of integers from the input.**

Explanation: The code `aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `aa`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `nabors` (which was initially greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4) is now a list of integers from the input, while `n`, `m`, and `k` are still integers from the input.
