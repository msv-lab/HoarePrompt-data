Postcondition: **`aa[m:]` must have at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element, and either `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, or `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0 and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 while `C[out_aa]` is not increased by 1; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes of the if-else block. It ensures that the conditions specified in both the if and else parts are met, including the changes in the values of `D[out_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, and `C[out_aa]`, as well as the constraints on the lists `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`.
