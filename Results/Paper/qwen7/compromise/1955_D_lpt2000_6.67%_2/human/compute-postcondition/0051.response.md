Postcondition: `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` remains 0; `in_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` starting from index `m+1` to the end; `out_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` from the beginning to `n - (m + 1)`; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if it is greater than 0, and `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if it is greater than 0; otherwise, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; if `D[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is not greater than 0; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0.
