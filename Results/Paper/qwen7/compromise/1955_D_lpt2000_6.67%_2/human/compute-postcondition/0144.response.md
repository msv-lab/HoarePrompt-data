Postcondition: `E[out_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, and `C[out_aa]` are integers. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. In both cases, `E[out_aa]` is guaranteed to be decreased by 1.
