Postcondition: **`aa[m:]` must contain at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must contain at least one element. `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, and `D[out_aa]` is either decremented by 1 or remains greater than 0. If `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, it is now `E[out_aa] - 1`; otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa] <= -1`, then `D[out_aa]` remains less than or equal to -1, and `E[out_aa]` and `C[out_aa]` retain their original values. If `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, then `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.**

This postcondition summarizes all the possible outcomes after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts, and the conditions provided.
