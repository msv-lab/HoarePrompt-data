Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must contain at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must contain at least one element, and `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 1`. If `E[out_aa]` was originally greater than 0, it is now `E[out_aa] - 1`. Otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 and `C[out_aa]` is now `C[out_aa] + 1`.
