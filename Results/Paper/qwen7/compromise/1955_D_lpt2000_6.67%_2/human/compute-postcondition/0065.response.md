Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`, `in_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` starting from index `m+2` to the end, `out_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` from the beginning to `n - (m + 2)`, `D[in_aa]` and `E[in_aa]` are each increased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

The code `C[out_aa] += 1` increases the value of `C[out_aa]` by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
