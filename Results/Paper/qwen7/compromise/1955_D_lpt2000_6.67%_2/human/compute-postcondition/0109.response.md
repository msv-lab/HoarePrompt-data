Output State: **`C[in_aa]` is equal to `C[in_aa]` + 1, `C[out_aa]` is equal to `D[out_aa]`, `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 while `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is equal to `D[in_aa]`, and `aa[m:]` must have at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element.**

In this output state, the value of `C[in_aa]` has been incremented by 1. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
