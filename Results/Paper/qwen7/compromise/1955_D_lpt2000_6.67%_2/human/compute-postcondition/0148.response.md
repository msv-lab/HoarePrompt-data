Postcondition: `E[out_aa]` and `D[out_aa]` are integers. If `C[in_aa]` equals `D[in_aa]`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `D[out_aa]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.
