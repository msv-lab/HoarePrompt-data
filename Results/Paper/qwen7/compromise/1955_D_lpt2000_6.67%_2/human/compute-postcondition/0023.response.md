Postcondition: `fnd` is 1 if `tot` (sum of the values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` is 0; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, otherwise `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged; `in_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` starting from index `m` to the end; `out_aa` is a non-empty slice of `aa` from the beginning to `n - m`; the current value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is now one less than its previous value; otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.
