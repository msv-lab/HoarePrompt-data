Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50; `sorted_lst` is a list of the same integers as `lst` but sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `lst` and assigns the sorted list to `sorted_lst`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged, but its elements are now in ascending order in `sorted_lst`. The conditions on the list `lst` (each integer between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length between 2 and 50) still apply.
