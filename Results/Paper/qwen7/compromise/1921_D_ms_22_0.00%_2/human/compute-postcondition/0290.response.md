Output State: `a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` and `diff2` are not defined, `max_heap` is empty, `tp1` is equal to `m`, `tp2` is equal to `-1`, `ans` is the sum of all the negative differences extracted from `max_heap` during the loop iterations, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `max_heap` will be empty because all elements have been processed. The variable `tp1` will be set to `m` because it increments until it reaches the length of `b` (assuming `b` has `m` elements). Similarly, `tp2` will be set to `-1` because it decrements until it goes below zero. The variable `ans` will hold the total sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, reflecting the closest elements' adjustments to the target values in `b`.
