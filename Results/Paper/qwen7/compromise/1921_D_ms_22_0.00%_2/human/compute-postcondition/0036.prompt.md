Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the first input split by space, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the second input split by space sorted in ascending order, `max_heap` is an empty list, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    diff1 = abs(i - b[0])
    diff2 = abs(i - b[m - 1])
    if diff1 > diff2:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff1, i, 0))
    else:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-diff2, i, m - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the first element of `a`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; either `max_heap` contains one tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` or `max_heap` contains one tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`, depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the second element of `a`; `diff1` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`; `diff2` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`; either `max_heap` contains a tuple with values `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or `max_heap` contains a tuple with values `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the second last element of `b`. After the execution of the if-else block, `max_heap` contains either the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
