Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

In this output state, the `max_heap` and the `item` variable retain their initial conditions. The `diff1` variable is newly introduced and holds the value of the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.
