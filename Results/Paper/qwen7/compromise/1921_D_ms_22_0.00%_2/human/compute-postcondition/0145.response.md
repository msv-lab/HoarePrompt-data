Postcondition: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. The condition `diff1 > diff2` is false**
