Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed.**

Explanation: The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the item with the highest value from the `max_heap`. After executing this line, `max_heap` no longer contains this item, and the variable `item` is assigned the value of the removed item.
