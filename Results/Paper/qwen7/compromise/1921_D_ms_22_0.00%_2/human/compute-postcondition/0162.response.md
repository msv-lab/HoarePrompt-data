Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`.**

Explanation: The code `item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)` removes and returns the highest value item from `max_heap`. After executing this line, `max_heap` no longer contains this item, and `item` holds the value of the highest item that was removed.
