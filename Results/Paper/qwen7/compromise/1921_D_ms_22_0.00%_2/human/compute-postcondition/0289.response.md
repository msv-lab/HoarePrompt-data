Postcondition: **`max_heap` is non-empty and does not contain the item that was popped; `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` depending on the condition `item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2`. If `item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1. If `item[2] == tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.**
