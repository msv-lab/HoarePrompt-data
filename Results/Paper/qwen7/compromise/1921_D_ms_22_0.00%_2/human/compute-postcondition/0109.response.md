Output State: **`tp1` is 0, `max_heap` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `b` is now a sorted list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
