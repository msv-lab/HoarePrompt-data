Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\); `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the first input split by space; `b` is a list of integers obtained from the second input split by space sorted in ascending order; `max_heap` is an empty list; `tp1` is 0; `tp2` is `m - 1`.**

The code `tp2 = m - 1` assigns the value of `m - 1` to `tp2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
