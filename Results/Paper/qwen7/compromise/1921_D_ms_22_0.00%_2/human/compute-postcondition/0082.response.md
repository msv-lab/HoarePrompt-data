Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

This means that the variable `diff1` has been assigned the value of the absolute difference between the second element of the `item` tuple and the value of `b[tp1]`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
