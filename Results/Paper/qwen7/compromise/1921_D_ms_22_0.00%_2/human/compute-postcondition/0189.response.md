Output State: **`max_heap` is not empty and does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by -item[0], `tp1` is incremented by 1, if `diff1` (the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) is greater, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, alternatively, if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by -1.**

Explanation: The code `tp1 += 1` increments the value of `tp1` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `tp1` being incremented by 1, while keeping the rest of the conditions and values as they were initially described.
