Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[1])`, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` contains at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])`, `tp1` is `1`, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `ans` is `ans + diff1`, and `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `ans += diff1` increments the value of `ans` by `diff1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
