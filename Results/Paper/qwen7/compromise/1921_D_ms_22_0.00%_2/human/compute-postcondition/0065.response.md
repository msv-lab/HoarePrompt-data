Output State: **`max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the second element of the `item` tuple (`item[1]`) and the element `b[tp1]`. This value is stored in the variable `diff1`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
