Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element to an integer before storing them in the list `a`. The values of `t` and `m` remain unchanged, and `n` remains an input integer.
