Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
