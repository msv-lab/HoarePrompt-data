Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the first input split by space, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the second input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the second input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
