Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item from `max_heap` before it was removed; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (where `diff1 > diff2`) or `diff2` (where `diff1 <= diff2`); `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1 > diff2`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1; if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is 1; `ans` is increased by `-item[0]` if `item[2]` is neither `tp1` nor `tp2`.
