Postcondition: `diff1` and `diff2` are the absolute differences between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, and `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` respectively. `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`. `tp1` and `tp2` are indices used to compare differences. If `diff1` is greater than `diff2`, then `tp1` is incremented by 1, `ans` is increased by `diff1`, and `diff2` remains as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. Otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, `ans` is increased by `diff2`, and `diff1` remains as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`.
