Output State: **`i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is equal to the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code updates `diff1` to the absolute difference between `i` (the third element of `a`) and the first element of `b`. The other variables (`diff2`, `max_heap`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
