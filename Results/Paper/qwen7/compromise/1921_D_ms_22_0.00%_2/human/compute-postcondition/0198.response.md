The loop head contains the variable `t`, which is used to control the number of iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that the loop will continue as long as `t > 0`, and since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a value greater than 0 for the loop to proceed.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
