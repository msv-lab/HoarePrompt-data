Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 99\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the first input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
