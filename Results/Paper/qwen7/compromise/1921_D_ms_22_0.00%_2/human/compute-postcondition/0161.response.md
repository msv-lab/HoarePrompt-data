The loop condition is `while max_heap:`. This means the loop continues as long as `max_heap` is not empty.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is still not empty. The only state that affects this condition is `max_heap`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `max_heap` is not empty for the loop to continue.

State: **`max_heap` is not empty**
