Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of the list `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of the list `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of the list `b`, `max_heap` contains a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` onto a max heap. The heap is represented here as `max_heap`. The values of `a`, `i`, `diff1`, and `diff2` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The new tuple is added to the heap, maintaining the condition that `diff1` is less than or equal to `diff2`.
