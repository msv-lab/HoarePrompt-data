Postcondition: **`max_heap` will be empty, indicating that all items have been processed. The variable `ans` will hold the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each item popped from `max_heap`, `ans` is updated by adding either the negative value of the first element of the popped item, the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` if the difference is greater than the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` if the difference is greater than or equal to the previous difference. Additionally, `tp1` will be incremented by 1 if `item[2]` is less than `tp1`, and `tp2` will be decremented by 1 if `item[2]` is greater than `tp2`. Otherwise, `ans` is increased by the greater of the two differences.**
