Output State: **`i` is `i_next`, `b[0]` is unchanged, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[0]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and `b[m - 1]`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code pushes a tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)` onto a max heap named `max_heap`. Since `heapq.heappush` modifies the heap, the heap now contains this new tuple. The other variables remain unchanged.
