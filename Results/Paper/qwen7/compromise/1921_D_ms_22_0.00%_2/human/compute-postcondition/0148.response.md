Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (if `diff1 > diff2`) or `diff2` (if `diff2 >= diff1`); `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1 > diff2`, and `tp2` is decreased by 1 if `diff2 >= diff1`.
