Postcondition: `max_heap` is not empty and does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by -item[0], `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, and `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `diff1` (the difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`) is greater; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1.
