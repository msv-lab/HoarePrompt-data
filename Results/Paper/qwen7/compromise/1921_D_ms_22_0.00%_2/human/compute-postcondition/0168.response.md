Output State: **`tp2` is decremented by 1, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; `ans` is increased by `diff2`**.

In this output state, `tp2` is decremented by 1, `diff1` remains unchanged, `max_heap` still does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is still the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `diff2` is updated to be the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, and `ans` is increased by `diff2`.
