Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `max_heap` will be empty, `ans` holds the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `tp1` and `tp2` will be adjusted according to the logic described, and `t` is equal to `t - 1`.**

The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The other variables (`max_heap`, `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
