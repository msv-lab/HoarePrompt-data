Output State: **`tp1` is 0, `max_heap` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `ans` holds the sum of the negative differences calculated during each iteration of the loop, `tp2` is `m - 1`, and `b` is now a sorted list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `tp2 = m - 1` assigns the value of `m - 1` to `tp2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
