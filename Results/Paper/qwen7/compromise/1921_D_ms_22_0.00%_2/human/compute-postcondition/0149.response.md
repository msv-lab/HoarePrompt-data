Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` or `diff2` depending on whether `diff1` is greater than `diff2`. If `diff1` is greater, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decreased by 1.
