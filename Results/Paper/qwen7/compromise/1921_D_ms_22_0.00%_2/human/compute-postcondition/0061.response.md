Postcondition: `max_heap` does not contain the item that was popped; `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`; `ans` is increased by either `diff1` (if `diff1` is greater than `diff2`) or `diff2` (otherwise); `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`; `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`; if `item[2]` is equal to `tp1`, `ans` is further increased by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is adjusted accordingly (decreased by 1 if `item[2]` is not equal to `tp1` and `item[2]` is not equal to `tp2`, or left unchanged if `item[2]` is equal to `tp2`).
