Output State: **`max_heap` is not empty and does not contain the item that was popped, `item` is the highest value item that was removed from `max_heap`, `ans` is increased by either the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]` or the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]` depending on which difference is greater, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp1]`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`, if `diff1` is greater, `tp1` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tp2` is decremented by 1, alternatively, if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, then `tp1` is increased by 1; otherwise, `ans` is increased by -1.**

Explanation: The code calculates `diff2` as the absolute difference between `item[1]` and `b[tp2]`. This calculation does not affect any other variables or the conditions of the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains all the information from the initial state, including the new variable `diff2`.
