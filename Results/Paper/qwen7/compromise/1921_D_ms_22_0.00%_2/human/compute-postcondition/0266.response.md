Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `diff2` is `abs(item[1] - b[m - 2])`, `max_heap` must now contain at least one tuple of the form `(-diff, item[1], item[2])` excluding the just popped tuple, `tp1` is `0` or `1`, `tp2` is `m - 3` or `m - 2`, `ans` is updated to `ans + diff1` or `ans - item[0]`, `diff1` is `abs(item[1] - b[tp1])`, and `ans` is increased by `diff2`.**

In this output state, the variable `ans` has been updated by adding the value of `diff2` to its current value. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
