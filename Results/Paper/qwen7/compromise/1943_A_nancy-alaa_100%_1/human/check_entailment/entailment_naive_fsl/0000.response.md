Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob and the optimal strategy they would employ. Instead, it simply checks for the presence of each number from 0 to \(n\) in the array and prints the first missing number, which does not reflect the game's rules.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The expected output based on the game rules should be:

```
2
1
0
```

However, the provided program will output:

```
0
0
1
```

This is incorrect because:

1. In the first test case, after Alice picks 1, the array becomes [0, 0], and Bob picks 0, making the array empty. The MEX of [1, 0] is 2, not 0.
2. In the second test case, the sequence should result in MEX 1, not 0.
3. In the third test case, the sequence should result in MEX 0, not 1.

Therefore, the program does not handle the game's logic correctly and does not produce the correct output for the given problem description.
