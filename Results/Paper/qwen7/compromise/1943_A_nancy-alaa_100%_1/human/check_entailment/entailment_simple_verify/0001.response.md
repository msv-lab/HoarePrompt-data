### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they modify two arrays `a` and `c`.
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then remove it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and remove it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to find the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of `c` at the end of the game, considering optimal play from both players.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n+1` to find the smallest missing integer (MEX).

3. **Key Issues in the Code:**
   - The code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - It assumes that the first occurrence of a unique element will be picked by Alice, and subsequent unique elements will be picked by Bob.
   - However, the optimal strategy involves more complex decision-making based on the counts and turns.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should try to maximize the MEX by ensuring that certain numbers are included in `c`.
   - Bob should minimize the MEX by ensuring that the smallest possible number is included in `c`.
   - The optimal solution involves counting the occurrences and determining the MEX based on the parity of the counts.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Alice should aim to include the smallest numbers in `c` by picking them first.
   - Bob should remove these smallest numbers to prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.
   - The optimal solution involves counting the occurrences and determining the MEX based on the parity of the counts.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code shows that the loop iterates from `0` to `n+1` to find the smallest missing integer (MEX).
   - The `Counter` object `mpp` keeps track of the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - The `first` flag is used to ensure that the first unique element is considered by Alice, and subsequent unique elements are considered by Bob.
   - However, this approach does not account for the optimal strategy where both players make decisions based on the counts and turns.

7. **Correctness of the Given Code:**
   - The given code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX. It fails to account for the optimal strategy where both players make decisions based on the counts and turns.
   - The code incorrectly assumes that the first unique element will be picked by Alice, and subsequent unique elements will be picked by Bob, which is not always the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
