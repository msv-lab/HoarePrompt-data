### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they modify two arrays `a` and `c`.
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then remove it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and remove it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to find the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of `c` at the end of the game, considering optimal play from both players.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n+1` to find the smallest missing integer (MEX).

3. **Key Issues in the Code:**
   - The code does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - It assumes that the first occurrence of a unique element will be picked by Alice, and subsequent unique elements will be picked by Bob.
   - However, the optimal strategy involves more complex decision-making based on the counts and turns.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should try to maximize the MEX by ensuring that certain numbers are included in `c`.
   - Bob should minimize the MEX by ensuring that the smallest possible number is included in `c`.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Alice should aim to include the smallest numbers in `c` by picking them first.
   - Bob should remove these smallest numbers to prevent Alice from achieving a higher MEX.
   - The optimal solution involves counting the occurrences and determining the MEX based on the parity of the counts.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
