Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the game's final score based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Here's why:

1. **Objective Misunderstanding**: The program attempts to find the MEX of the array `arr` directly, which is not aligned with the game rules. The game involves two different types of moves (Alice and Bob), and the final MEX should be determined by the sequence of moves made by both players.

2. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**: The program tries to find the smallest missing integer in the array `arr` without considering the turns taken by Alice and Bob. It simply prints the first missing integer found in the array, which does not account for the game's rules where Alice can pick any element and Bob can only pick elements from the remaining ones.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The program does not simulate the optimal strategy for both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current implementation does not consider these objectives and does not simulate the game properly.

Given these points, the annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
