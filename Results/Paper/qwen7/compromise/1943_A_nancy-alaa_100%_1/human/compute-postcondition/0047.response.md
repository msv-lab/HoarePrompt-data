Output State: **`first` is True, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `arr`. The other variables (`first`, `n`, `mpp`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
