Output State: **Postcondition: `first` is True, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is less than `n + 1` and equal to the previous value of `i` + 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement. However, no variables are modified by this statement, so their previous states remain unchanged.
