Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `first` is True, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers converted from input, `i` is `n + 1`, and the variable `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. No further changes occur in the loop as `i` reaches `n + 1`.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations without breaking early. The value of `i` has incremented to `n + 1`, and since the loop condition `i < n + 1` is no longer satisfied, the loop terminates. The variable `first` remains True because it was set to True during one of the loop iterations when `mpp[i] == 1`. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, and `mpp`) retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
