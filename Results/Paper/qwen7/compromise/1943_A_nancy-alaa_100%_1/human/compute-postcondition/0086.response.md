Postcondition: **`first` remains False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is `i + 1`, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp` or if `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1, `first` remains False and no other changes occur.**
