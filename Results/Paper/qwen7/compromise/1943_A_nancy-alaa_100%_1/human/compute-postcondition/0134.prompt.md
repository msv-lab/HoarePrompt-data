Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and an array a of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mpp = Counter(arr)
    first = False
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i not in mpp.keys():
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
            print(i)
            break
        if mpp[i] == 1:
            first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `first` is True, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `n + 1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n`. The variable `first` remains `True` unless `mpp[i]` equals 1 during any iteration, which would make it `False`. Since the loop does not change `n`, `arr`, or `mpp` except for the condition checks, these variables retain their original values from the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `first` remains False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is `n + 1`, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `first` remains unchanged at False because none of the conditions inside the loop that could set it to True were met. The value of `n` remains as the input integer, `arr` remains the list of integers converted from the input, and `i` becomes `n + 1` after the last iteration of the loop. The `mpp` (Counter object) also remains unchanged as none of the operations within the loop modify its contents.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `first` is True, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers converted from input, `i` is `n + 1`, and the variable `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. No further changes occur in the loop as `i` reaches `n + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
