Postcondition: `first` remains False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and if `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs in the variables.
