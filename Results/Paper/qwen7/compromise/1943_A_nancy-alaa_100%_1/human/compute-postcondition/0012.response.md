Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- The current value of `i` is such that `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is `True`.

The print statement is `print(i)`. According to the precondition, there exists an integer `i` such that `mpp[i]` equals 1. Since `first` is `True`, it implies that this is the first time an integer with a count of 1 is encountered.

Therefore, the value of `i` will be the integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`.

Output: **i (where i is the integer that appears exactly once in the list arr)**
