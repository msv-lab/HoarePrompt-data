Output State: **`first` is True, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is less than `n + 1` and equal to the previous value of `i` + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or conditional block that was being executed. However, the values of the variables `first`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
