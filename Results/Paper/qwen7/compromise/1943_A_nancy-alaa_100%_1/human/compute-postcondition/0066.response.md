Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` remains False: This indicates that the variable `first` has not been set to True yet.
- `n` is an input integer: This means `n` is some integer value provided as input.
- `arr` is a list of integers converted from input: This implies that `arr` is a list containing integers derived from the input value `n`.
- `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`: This means `mpp` is a dictionary-like object where keys are the integers in `arr` and values are their respective counts.
- `i` is 1: This indicates that the variable `i` is initialized to 1.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly stated to be 1, the print statement will simply output the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
