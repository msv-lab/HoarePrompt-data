Output State: **`first` is False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is less than `n + 1` and equal to the previous value of `i` + 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is executed, the loop or conditional block that was being executed is exited. However, no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only change is that we have exited the most internal loop or if statement.
