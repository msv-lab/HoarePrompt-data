Output State: **`first` is False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `i` is less than `n + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or if statement it is inside. Therefore, the values of `first`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
