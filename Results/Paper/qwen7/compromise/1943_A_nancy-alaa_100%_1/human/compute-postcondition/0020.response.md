Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n` inclusive. This means the loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Determine the state changes**: At the end of the previous iteration, `first` is `False`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, and `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. The postcondition is that if `mpp[i]` equals 1, `first` remains `False`.

Given that the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, let's consider what happens at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

Since no modifications to `n` or `first` are mentioned in the loop body (and we are only considering the state at the start of the next iteration), we can assume `n` and `first` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `n` remains the same.
- `first` remains `False`.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`first` is False, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is 1 more than its value at the end of the previous iteration**.
