Output State: `first` is True, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers converted from input, `i` is `n + 1`, and the variable `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `n`. The variable `first` remains `True` unless `mpp[i]` equals 1 during any iteration, which would make it `False`. Since the loop does not change `n`, `arr`, or `mpp` except for the condition checks, these variables retain their original values from the initial state. Therefore, after all iterations, `first` is `True`, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is the list of integers converted from input, `i` is `n + 1`, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
