Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is a list of integers converted from input
- `i` is less than `n + 1`

The if-else block is not explicitly shown, but it involves checking conditions related to `i` and `mpp` (which is not defined in the initial state). Given that `first` is `False`, the conditions inside the if-else block do not change `first` to `True` because `first` remains `False`.

Since `first` is `False`, the condition `if i not in mpp and mpp[i] == 1 and first: break` will never be true, and thus no break statement will be executed. This means the loop or if-else block will continue to check the next value of `i` until the end.

Given that `i` is less than `n + 1`, the last possible value for `i` is `n`. Therefore, when the print statement is executed, `i` will have the value of `n`.

Output: **n**
