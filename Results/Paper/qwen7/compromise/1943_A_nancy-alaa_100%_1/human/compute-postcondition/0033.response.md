Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `True`
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `arr` is a list of integers
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`
- `i` is `n + 1`

The code snippet `print(i)` simply prints the value of the variable `i`.

Given that `i` is defined as `n + 1`, and `n` is a non-negative integer, the value of `i` will be `n + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **n + 1**
