Postcondition: **`first` remains False, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers converted from input, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is 0. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
