Output State: **`first` is True, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, and `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`first`, `arr`, `mpp`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
