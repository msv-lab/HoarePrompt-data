Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` creates a `Counter` object named `mpp` that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`. The initial state of `n` and `arr` remains unchanged. The `Counter` object `mpp` is a new variable that holds the frequency count of elements in `arr`.
