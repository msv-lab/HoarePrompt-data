### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes no parameters and returns a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet (`'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`), repeated `n` times.
   - This means for `n=2` and `k=3`, the function would return `"abcabc"`.
   - For `n=2` and `k=2`, the function would return `"abab"`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` and prints the result.
   - `func_1()` generates a string of length `n*k` by repeating the first `k` characters of the alphabet `n` times.

3. **Evaluation Against Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires generating a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
   - The current implementation simply repeats the first `k` characters `n` times, which does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are included.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider `n=2` and `k=3`. The function returns `"abcabc"`.
   - This string does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (`"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ac"`, `"ba"`, `"bb"`, `"bc"`, `"ca"`, `"cb"`, `"cc"`).
   - Specifically, it does not contain `"aa"`, `"bb"`, `"cc"`, etc., as valid subsequences.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation does not satisfy the problem's requirement because it does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are included in the generated string `s`.
   - Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`.
