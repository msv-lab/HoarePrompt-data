Output State: **`ans` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `k` is not equal to 1.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. No changes are made to the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, or `bk`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
