Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a string containing the length of the list `ans` followed by a space-separated string of its elements. If `k` is 1, it returns '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`, and then returns a string with the length of `ans` and its elements in a space-separated format.**
