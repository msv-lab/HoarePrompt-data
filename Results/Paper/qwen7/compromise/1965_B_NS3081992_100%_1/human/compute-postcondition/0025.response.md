Output State: **ans is a list containing the elements [1, 2, 4, 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** lk, 2 ** (lk + 1), ..., 2 ** (l - 1)]**.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `ans` will contain the original elements [1, 2, 4, 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1] followed by additional elements which are powers of 2 starting from \(2^{lk}\) up to \(2^{(l-1)}\).
