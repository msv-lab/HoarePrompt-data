Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the elements [1, 2, 4, 3, k + 1]**.

The code appends `k + 1` to the list `ans`. Since `k` is not defined in the initial state, `k + 1` remains as it is, and is added to the existing list `[1, 2, 4, 3]`. Therefore, the updated list is `[1, 2, 4, 3, k + 1]`.
