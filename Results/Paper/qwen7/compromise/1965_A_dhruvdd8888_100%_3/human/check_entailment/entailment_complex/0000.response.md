Reasoning:
1. The problem statement describes a game where players take turns removing a certain number of stones from each non-empty pile, with the player who cannot make a move losing.
2. The provided solution attempts to solve this problem by sorting the piles and checking for the presence of a pile with exactly one stone.
3. The logic in the function `func_1()` is flawed:
   - The function reads the number of piles `N` and the sizes of the piles into a set `nums`.
   - It then sorts the set and modifies the elements by subtracting the cumulative sum of previous elements.
   - The purpose of these operations is unclear and does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The function then incorrectly checks for the presence of a `1` in the modified list to determine the winner.
   - The logic to determine the winner is also incorrect. The correct approach involves using the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles after sorting them in descending order.
4. Given the incorrect logic and operations, the provided solution does not correctly implement the game rules and cannot determine the winner accurately.

Correctness: **False**
