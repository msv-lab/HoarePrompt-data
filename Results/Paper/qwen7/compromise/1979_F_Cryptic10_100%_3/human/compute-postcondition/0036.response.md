Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, which means it iterates over the reversed version of the list `ops`.
   - The loop variables in the header are `v1` and `v2`, which are elements of each tuple in `ops`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ops`:**
   - `ops` is a list containing up to `n-2` tuples.
   - Each tuple in `ops` contains two elements, `v1` and `v2`.

3. **Check the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple. Since `ops` can contain up to `n-2` tuples, it must have at least 1 tuple to ensure the loop runs at least once.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `t` and `n` are not directly related to the loop execution based on the given information.
   - `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, but this does not affect the loop's ability to execute.
   - `p1` and `p2` are the elements of the set `vx`, but they do not influence the loop's execution either.

Given these points, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `ops` contains at least one tuple.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ops` is a list containing at least 1 tuple**
