Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started; `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`; `p2` is an empty list; `ops` is a list containing tuples representing all operations executed during the loop, with each tuple indicating the removal of an element from `vx` and possibly adding an operation based on the value of `v2`; `v1` and `v2` are undefined.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started; `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`; `p2` is a list with one element `v1`; `ops` must contain at least one tuple, and `v2` is part of that tuple.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started; `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`; `p2` is a list with one element `v1`; `ops` must contain at least one tuple, and `v2` is part of that tuple; `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; if the last element of `p1` (which is `vx[-1]`) is equal to `v2`, then `p2` appends `v1`; otherwise, `p1` appends `v1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started; `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`; `p2` is a list with one element `v1`; `ops` must contain at least one tuple, and `v2` is part of that tuple; `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; if the last element of `p1` (which is `vx[-1]`) is equal to `v2`, then `p2` appends `v1`, otherwise `p1` appends `v1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
