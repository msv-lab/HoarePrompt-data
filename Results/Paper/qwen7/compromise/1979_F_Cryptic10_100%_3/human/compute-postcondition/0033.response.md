Output State: `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing a single integer, `ops` is a list containing a series of tuples based on the operations performed during each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the set `vx` will contain only one element because the loop continues as long as the length of `vx` is greater than 2. Each iteration removes either one or two elements from `vx` based on the conditions within the loop. The list `ops` will contain a series of tuples that represent the operations performed during each iteration, with each tuple indicating which elements were removed and their associated values.
