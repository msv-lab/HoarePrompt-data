Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing up to `n-2` tuples, `p1` is the first element of the set `vx`, and `p2` is the second element of the set `vx`.**

Explanation: The code snippet creates two variables, `p1` and `p2`, by converting the set `vx` into a list and assigning the first and second elements of this list to `p1` and `p2`, respectively. Since the loop ensures that `vx` contains exactly 2 elements before exiting, `p1` and `p2` will be those two elements. The values of `t`, `n`, and `vx` remain unchanged, and `ops` retains its previous state with up to `n-2` tuples.
