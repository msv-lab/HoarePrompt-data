Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements with the first element being the last but one element of the original `vx` and the second element being the last element of the original `vx`; `v2` is equal to the last but one element of the original `vx`; `v1` does not exist; `ops` is a list containing a tuple `(v1, v2)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Since `v1` is removed from `vx`, it no longer exists. `v2` remains as the last but one element of the original `vx`. The first element of `vx` is now the last but one element of the original `vx`, and the second element of `vx` is the last element of the original `vx`.
