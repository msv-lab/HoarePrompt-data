Output State: The list `ops` will have been fully processed in reverse order. For each tuple `(v1, v2)` in `ops[::-1]`, if the last element of the first tuple is equal to `v2`, then `v1` will be appended to the first tuple. If the last element of the first tuple is not equal to `v2`, the first tuple remains unchanged. This process will continue for all tuples in `ops[::-1]`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the first tuple in `ops` will have had its last element updated as many times as there are tuples in `ops` where the condition `p1[-1] == v2` is met. All other tuples in `ops` will remain unaltered.
