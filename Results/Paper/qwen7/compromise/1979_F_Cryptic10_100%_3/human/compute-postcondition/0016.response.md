Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to len(vx) - 3, and `len(vx)` must be greater than 2; `v1` and `v2` are assigned the result of `q(len(vx) - 2)`**.

This means that `v1` and `v2` are now holding the values returned by the function `q(len(vx) - 2)`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `vx` remain unchanged from their initial states.
