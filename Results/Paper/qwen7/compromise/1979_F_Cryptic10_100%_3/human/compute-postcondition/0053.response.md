Postcondition: **`ops` will have been partially processed in reverse order, with the current tuple being the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) excluding `v1`; `v1` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`; `v2` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`. Additionally, `v2` is less than or equal to 0.**
