Output State: **`ops` is a list containing at least one tuple where the last element of the first tuple is updated based on the condition (if the last element of the first tuple is equal to `v2`, then append `v1` to the first tuple, otherwise the first tuple remains unchanged); `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`. The first tuple in `ops` has been modified according to the condition.**

Explanation: The code checks if the last element of the first tuple in `ops` is equal to `v2`. If it is, then `v1` is appended to the first tuple. Otherwise, the first tuple remains unchanged. After the operation, `v1` and `v2` retain their original values as they are not affected by the code. The rest of the list `ops` remains unchanged.
