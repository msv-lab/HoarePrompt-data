Postcondition: `v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 1`, `vx` does not contain its `v1` element, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(v1, v2)` if `v2 > 0`. Otherwise, `v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 1`, `vx` does not contain its `v3` element, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)`, and `ops` is `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.
