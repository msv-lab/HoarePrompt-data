Output State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started; `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`; `p2` is a list with one element `v1`; `ops` must contain at least one tuple, and `v2` is part of that tuple.**

Explanation:
- The code checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`.
- If `p1[-1]` (which is the last element of the original `vx`) is equal to `v2`, then `p2` would append `v1`.
- Otherwise, `p1` appends `v1`.
- Since `p1` originally contains the last two elements of `vx`, and `p2` is initially empty, appending `v1` to `p2` means `p2` now contains `v1`.
- The sets `vx` and `p1` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them directly within the given code snippet.
