Postcondition: `v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` is a list with either one element removed at index `v1` and `v2 > 0`, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(v1, v2)`, or two elements removed at indices `v1` and `v3` (where `v3` is the first element returned by `q(0)`), `v1` is `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` is a list with these two elements removed, and `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`.
