Postcondition: `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer excluding `v1`; `v2` is another integer from `vx` excluding the last two elements. `ops` is a list. If `v2 > 0`, then `ops` contains a tuple `(v1, v2)`. Otherwise, `ops` contains tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, where `v3` is the first return value of `q(0)`.
