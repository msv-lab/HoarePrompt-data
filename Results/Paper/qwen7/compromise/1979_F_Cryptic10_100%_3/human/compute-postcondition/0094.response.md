Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer excluding `v1`; `v2` is another integer from `vx` excluding the last two elements; `ops` is a list containing a tuple `(v1, v2)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. The values of `vx` and `v2` remain unchanged, and `v1` is part of the tuple added to `ops`. The precondition that `v2` is greater than 0 still holds true since no operations change its value.
