Output State: `t` is 1, `i` is equal to `N`, and `N` is greater than 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `N` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `N-1` and then continues to increment until it reaches `N`. The variable `t` will remain 1 because the condition `cnt[i] == 1` was met exactly once (when `i` was the last unique element in the list `a`), and no subsequent elements caused `t` to be incremented again or the loop to break prematurely. The value of `N` remains greater than 0 as it was initially and has not been modified by the loop.
