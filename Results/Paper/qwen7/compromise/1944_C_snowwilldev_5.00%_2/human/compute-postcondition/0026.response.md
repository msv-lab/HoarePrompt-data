Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the constant `N`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `N`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `N-1`.
   - `t` is unchanged.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is `N-1`, the condition `i < N` will be false, and the loop will not execute again.
   - Therefore, there is no need to change the value of `i` because the loop will not run.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged.
   - Since the loop breaks, no further changes are needed for the internal loop or if statement conditions.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` remains `N-1`.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - No additional constraints are added for the loop to execute again since it won't.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `N-1`, `t` is unchanged**.
