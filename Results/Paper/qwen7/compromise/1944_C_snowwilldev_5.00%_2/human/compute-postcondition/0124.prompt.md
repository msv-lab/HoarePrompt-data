Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            print(i)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The value of `i` remains as `N-1` throughout all iterations, `t` remains unchanged (either 0 or 1 depending on the initial conditions and the loop's execution), and no elements are printed during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is 1, `i` is 2, and `N` is greater than 0.

Explanation: Based on the given information, after the loop has executed 3 times, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, and `N` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop has completed its full execution, there is no further change in the values of these variables. The value of `t` remains 1 because it was incremented once when `cnt[2]` was 1 (assuming `cnt[2]` was the last element checked before the loop condition was met). The value of `i` is 2 as it was incremented three times within the loop but did not reach a point where the loop would break due to `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`. Therefore, `N` remains greater than 0 as it was initially and has not been modified by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All iterations of the loop have been executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
