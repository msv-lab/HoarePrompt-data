Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 1, and `N` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a match-case statement. In this case, since there is no loop or match-case statement specified, the values of the variables `t`, `i`, and `N` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` is still 1, `i` is still 1, and `N` is still greater than 0.
