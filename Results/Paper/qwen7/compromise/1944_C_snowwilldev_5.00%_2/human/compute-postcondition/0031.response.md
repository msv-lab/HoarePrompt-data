Output State: **`i` is `N-1`, `t` is either `t + 1` if `cnt[i] == 1`, or remains unchanged if `cnt[i] != 1`. and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the loop or conditional block to exit without changing the values of `i` and `t`. The conditions for `t` remain the same as they were before the execution of the `break` statement.
