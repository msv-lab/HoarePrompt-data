Output State: **`i` is `N-1`; `t` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[N-1] == 1`, otherwise `t` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `i` remains `N-1`. The value of `t` is updated by adding 1 to its current value only if `cnt[N-1]` equals 1; otherwise, `t` stays the same as its previous value.
