Output State: **`i` is 0; `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `i` is 0 and `N` is a positive integer, but no specific value for `a` is given, we assume `a[0]` exists and `cnt` is a dictionary. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0, and `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1.
