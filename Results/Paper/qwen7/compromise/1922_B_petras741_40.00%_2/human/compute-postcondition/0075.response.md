Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The range of the loop is `range(n)`, which means `j` will iterate from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 0.
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 1.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, so for the next iteration, `j` should be 1 and it must still be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `j`. Therefore, `j` should be set to 1.

6. **Consider the state of `q[w[j]]`**: Since `q[w[j]]` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration when `j` was 0, the value of `q[w[1]]` (since `j` will now be 1) will be incremented in the next iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 1, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1**
