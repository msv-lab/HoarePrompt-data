Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `w` is a list of integers from another input split by spaces
   - `eta_ln` is 3
   - `j` is `n`
   - `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2
   - `rho` is 0

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is the number of iterations the loop should run.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

**State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from another input split by spaces, `eta_ln` is 3, `j` is `n`, `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 0**
