Output State: **`q[j]` is an integer in the list `q`; if `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains the integer `j` and `eta` is appended with `j`; `j` is now `k + 1`; `n` remains the same; there is no change to `q[j]` or `eta` if the condition `q[j] > 0` is not met.**

This means that if the condition `q[j] > 0` was true, then `j` has been added to the list `eta`. Also, `j` has been updated to `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
