Output State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1**.

The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1 and also increments the value of `j` by 1. The initial conditions that `n` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `j` remain valid after the code execution, but since no value for `n` was given initially, we do not include it in the output state. The other variables remain unaffected.
