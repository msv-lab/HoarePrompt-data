Output State: **`j` is `n-1`; each element in `q` is incremented by 1 for its corresponding index in `w`, so `q` is a list of integers where each element is the frequency of its corresponding index in `w`.**

In this final state, the variable `j` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop runs `n` times in total. After all iterations, the list `q` will contain the count of how many times each index (from `w[0]` to `w[n-1]`) appears in the list `w`.
