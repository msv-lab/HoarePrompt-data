Output State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is greater than 1000, `rho` is `q[0] + q[eta[j]]`, `res` is `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * q[0]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `eta`, `j`, `rho`, and `res`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement the program was currently inside. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
