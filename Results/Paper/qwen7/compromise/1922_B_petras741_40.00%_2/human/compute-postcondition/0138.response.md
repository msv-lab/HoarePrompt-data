Output State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. It also increments the value of `j` by 1. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `j` remains valid after the code execution, but since no changes were made to `n`, its condition relative to `j` is still true. The other variables remain unchanged.
