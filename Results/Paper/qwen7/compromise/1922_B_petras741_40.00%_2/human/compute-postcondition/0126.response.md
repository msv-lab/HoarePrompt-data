Postcondition: **`eta_ln` is 3, `j` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `q[j]` is 0, `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 0. If `eta_ln` equals 1, then `j` remains `n`, `res` remains unchanged, and `rho` remains 0. If `n` is 1 or 2, `j` becomes `eta_ln`, `res` is updated to the original value of `res` plus the specified summations, `rho` is updated accordingly, and if `j > 1000`, the loops or if statements are exited.**
