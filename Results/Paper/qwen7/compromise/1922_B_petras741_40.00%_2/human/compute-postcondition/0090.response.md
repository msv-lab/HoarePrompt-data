Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is a non-negative integer
   - `q[1]` is greater than 0
   - `eta` contains the value 0
   - If `q[1]` is greater than 0, then `eta` now has one element, which is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`.

4. **Check the current value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

5. **Determine the next value of `j`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become 2.

6. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < n + 1`. Since `j` is currently 1 and `n` is a non-negative integer, the loop will continue if `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

7. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state of `j` to 2. The other variables (`n`, `q[1]`, and `eta`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a non-negative integer, `q[1]` is greater than 0, and `eta` contains the value 0**.
