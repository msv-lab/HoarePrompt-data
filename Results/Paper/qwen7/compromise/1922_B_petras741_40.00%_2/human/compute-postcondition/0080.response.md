Output State: **`j` is `n-1`; each element in `q` is incremented by 1 for its corresponding index in `w`, so `q` is a list of integers where each element is the frequency of its corresponding index in `w`; `eta` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `eta = []` creates an empty list named `eta`. This operation does not affect the values of `j`, `q`, or `w`. Therefore, the values of `j` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `eta` is initialized as an empty list.
