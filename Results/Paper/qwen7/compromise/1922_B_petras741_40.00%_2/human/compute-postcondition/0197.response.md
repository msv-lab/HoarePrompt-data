Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), a positive integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list of non-negative integers \( a \) (0 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( n \)). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the distribution of the integers in \( a \). If \( n \) is less than 3, it prints 0. Otherwise, it computes a specific combinatorial expression involving the counts of distinct integers in \( a \) and prints the result.**
