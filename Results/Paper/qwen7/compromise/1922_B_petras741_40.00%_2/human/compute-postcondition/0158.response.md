Output State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n + n`, `eta_ln` is 0**

Explanation: The line `eta_ln = len(eta)` calculates the length of the list `eta`. Since `eta` is initially an empty list, its length is 0. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it was defined as `n + n` before. The variable `eta` and its length `eta_ln` are updated, while `j` retains its initial value.
