Output State: **`n` is 1 or 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `q[eta[n]] * (q[eta[n]] - 1) * (q[eta[n]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `2 * q[eta[j]]`**

Explanation:
- The variable `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its current value.
- The value of `j` remains `n + 1`.
- The value of `rho` is increased by `2 * q[eta[j]]`.

Since the initial value of `res` includes terms involving `q[eta[n]]` and `q[eta[j]]`, and `j` is defined as `n + 1`, the updated value of `res` now includes an additional term involving `q[eta[j]]`. The value of `rho` is also increased by `2 * q[eta[j]]`.
