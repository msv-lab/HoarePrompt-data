Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `j` and `n`, we need to update `j` and ensure that the condition `j < n` still holds true for the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` is now `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than `n`.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `q[w[j]]` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `j` is updated to `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be greater than `j + 1`**
