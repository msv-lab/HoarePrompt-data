Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `eta[j]` is unchanged, `q` is unchanged, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`**.

This means that the value of `res` remains the same as it was initially calculated, `eta[j]` and `q` remain unchanged, and `rho` is incremented by the value of `q[eta[j]]`.
