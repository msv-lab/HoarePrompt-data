Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program attempts to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with the same length, but it does not account for the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
3
1 2 3
```

The correct output should be `0` because no three sticks can form a triangle with lengths \(2^1\), \(2^2\), and \(2^3\) (i.e., 2, 4, and 8). However, the program will incorrectly output a positive number because it only checks if there are enough sticks of the same length to form combinations, without verifying the triangle inequality.

To fix this, the program needs to check the triangle inequality condition for each combination of three sticks.
