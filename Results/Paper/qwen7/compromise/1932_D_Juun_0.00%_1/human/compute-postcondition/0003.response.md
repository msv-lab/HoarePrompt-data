Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump` is the input string received from the user, `answers` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `answers`. The values of `trumps`, `t`, `n`, and `trump` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes all these variables with their respective initial conditions.
