Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(lst)`. These are the only objects that can be adjusted.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` starts from 0 according to the `range(len(lst))` expression. Therefore, `i` should be set to 0 initially.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst)`. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `len(lst)` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the State of `lst`**: The list `lst` itself does not change within the loop head, but its length (`len(lst)`) is crucial for determining whether the loop can execute. Therefore, `lst` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

5. **State the Final Adjusted State**: Based on the above points, the initial state before the loop starts should include the value of `i` and the condition on `lst`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`r` is 0, `l` is 0, `over_sum` is the sum of the list `lst`, `i` is 0, and `lst` must have at least one element**.
