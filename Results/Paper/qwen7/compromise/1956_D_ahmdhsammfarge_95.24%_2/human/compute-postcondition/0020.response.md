Output State: **r is [0, len(lst)], l is len(lst), over_sum is (len(lst) - 0 + 1)**.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will iterate through all possible starting indices from 0 to the second-to-last index of the list `lst`. The variable `j` will iterate through all indices greater than `i` up to the last index of the list `lst`. During each iteration, the code calculates `sm` as the sum of elements before `i`, elements after `j`, plus a quadratic term `(j - i + 1) ** 2`. The condition checks if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`. If it is, `r` and `l` are updated to `[i, j]` and `over_sum` is updated to `sm`. Since the loop iterates through all possible pairs of `i` and `j`, the maximum value of `sm` found during these iterations will be stored in `over_sum`, and the corresponding indices `[i, j]` will be stored in `r` and `l`. Given the nature of the quadratic term `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, the maximum value of `sm` will occur when `i` is 0 and `j` is the last index of the list, making `r` equal to `[0, len(lst)]` and `l` equal to `len(lst)`. The final `over_sum` will be the value of `(len(lst) - 0 + 1) ** 2`.
