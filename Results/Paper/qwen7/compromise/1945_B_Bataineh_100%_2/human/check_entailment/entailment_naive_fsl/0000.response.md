Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where the visibility period \(m\) is greater than or equal to both \(a\) and \(b\). In such cases, the program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
10 15 20
```

The program will output:
```
4
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
5
```

This is because:
- The first installation launches fireworks at times: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, ...
- The second installation launches fireworks at times: 15, 30, 45, 60, ...

Within the visibility period of 20 minutes, the following fireworks will be visible simultaneously:
- From the first installation: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
- From the second installation: 15, 30, 45

Since 30 is common and visible for 20 minutes, the total number of unique visible fireworks is 5 (10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 45, but 30 is counted once).

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases, making it incorrect.
