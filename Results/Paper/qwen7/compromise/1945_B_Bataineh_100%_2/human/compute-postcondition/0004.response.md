Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18). It returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integer values, and for each test case, it processes the integers `a`, `b`, and `m` to produce a result, without accepting these values as direct function parameters.
