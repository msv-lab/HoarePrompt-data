Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed during each iteration of the loop, based on the conditions provided in the loop body. Each line of output corresponds to the result of processing one set of inputs (a, b, m) for a given value of `i` in the range of `t`. The exact values will depend on the specific inputs provided for each iteration.
