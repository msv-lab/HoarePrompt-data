    #The program returns a list of sorted cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list 'a'. The length of this list is equal to the length of 'a', and each element in the list represents the sum of elements starting from the corresponding index to the end of the list 'a', sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a`, which represents the subarray sums of a palindrome array. It calculates the cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`, sorts these sums, and returns them as a new list. The returned list has the same length as the input list `a`, with each element representing the sorted cumulative sum from the corresponding index to the end of the list `a`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cts is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array a. Each element in cts is a positive integer and 1 ≤ ct ≤ 10^9.

    #State: Output State: `odds` is a list where each element is unique and appears only once, `ct` is the last value processed by the loop, `cts` is a list from which all elements have been processed.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `odds` list contains only unique elements from `cts`, with each element appearing exactly once. The variable `ct` holds the value of the last element processed by the loop. The `cts` list has been completely iterated over, meaning all its elements have either been appended to or removed from the `odds` list according to the conditions specified in the loop.
    return odds
    #`odds` is a list containing unique elements from `cts`, with each element appearing exactly once, and `ct` is the value of the last element processed by the loop. `cts` has been completely iterated over.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `cts` of integers and returns a list `odds` containing unique elements from `cts`, with each element appearing exactly once, and an integer `ct` representing the last element processed by the loop. After processing, the original `cts` list has been completely iterated over.

        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `odds` list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The `prev` variable will hold the last value of `x` from the `odds` list after the loop completes. The `idx` variable will be set to \(-1\) because it starts at \((n - 1) // 2\) and is decremented until it reaches \(-1\). The array `a` will be populated based on the values in `odds` according to the rules specified in the loop body. Specifically, for each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, the middle element of `a` will be updated to `x`. Otherwise, the elements symmetrically positioned around the center of `a` will be updated to \((x - prev) // 2\), with `prev` being the value of `x` from the previous iteration.
    return a
    #The program returns an array 'a' populated based on the values in the 'odds' list. For each 'x' in 'odds', if 'idx' equals 'n - 1 - idx', the middle element of 'a' is updated to 'x'. Otherwise, the elements symmetrically positioned around the center of 'a' are updated to \((x - prev) // 2\), with 'prev' being the value of 'x' from the previous iteration. The 'prev' variable holds the last value of 'x' from the 'odds' list, and 'idx' is set to \(-1\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `odds` and an integer `n`. It returns an array `a` of size `n` populated based on the values in `odds`. For each value `x` in `odds`, if the current index `idx` is the middle index of `a`, the middle element of `a` is set to `x`. Otherwise, the elements symmetrically positioned around the center of `a` are set to half the difference between `x` and the previous value `prev`. After processing all values in `odds`, the function returns the array `a`, with `prev` holding the last value from `odds` and `idx` set to \(-1\).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList is a list of integers representing the complete set of subarray sums, and smallList is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array a.
def func_4(bigList, smallList):

    #State: Output State: `bigList` is an empty list, `smallList` is a list of integers with all elements except possibly the first one removed, and the length of `smallList` is less than or equal to the length of `bigList` before the loop started. 
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `bigList` will be emptied, and `smallList` will have been reduced until either it is empty or the condition `len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` no longer holds true.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of bigList, which is the same as the last element of smallList when the loop ends
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `bigList` and `smallList`, both containing integers. It removes elements from the end of both lists as long as their last elements match. Once the condition no longer holds, it returns the last element of `bigList`, which will be the same as the last element of `smallList` if any elements remain.
