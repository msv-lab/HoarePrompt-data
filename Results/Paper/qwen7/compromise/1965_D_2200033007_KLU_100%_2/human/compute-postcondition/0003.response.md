Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed.
   - `smallList` is a list of integers with the last element removed.
   - The last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`.

3. **Determine what needs to change**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
     - `len(smallList) > 0`
     - `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` is already satisfied (as per the given state), we don't need to change this condition.
   - To ensure `len(smallList) > 0`, `smallList` must still have at least one element.

5. **Final state**:
   - `bigList` remains a list of integers with the last element removed.
   - `smallList` must have at least one element left.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `smallList` must have at least one element left**
