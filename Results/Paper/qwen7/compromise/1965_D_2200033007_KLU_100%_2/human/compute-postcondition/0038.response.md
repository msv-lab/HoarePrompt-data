Output State: **`sm` is equal to its previous value plus `a[j]`, `j` is `j + 1`, `cts` is a list with the appended value of `sm + a[j]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by adding `a[j]` to its current value, increments `j` by 1, and appends the new value of `sm + a[j]` to the list `cts`. The initial conditions of `sm` being equal to its previous value plus `a[j+1]` and `j` being `j + 1` are now updated accordingly, while the list `cts` is updated with the new value.
