Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cts` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array, and the length of `a` is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) where `n` is the size of the unknown palindrome array.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    sm = 0
    for j in range(i, len(a)):
        sm = sm + a[j]
        cts.append(sm)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is the length of the list `a`, `j` is one less than the length of the list `a`, `a` is a non-empty list, `sm` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, `cts` is a list containing all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`.

To explain this output state in natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`, since the loop increments `i` but does not change it once `j` reaches the length of `a`. The variable `j` will be one less than the length of `a` because the loop runs until `j` is less than the length of `a`, and then stops. The variable `sm` will hold the sum of all elements in the list `a` because it accumulates the sum of elements from the current `i` to the current `j` in each iteration. The list `cts` will contain all the cumulative sums from each starting index to the end of the list `a`, as each iteration appends the current cumulative sum to `cts`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is equal to `len(a) + (len(a) - 1)`, `sm` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`, `cts` is a list containing all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` remains as `len(a) - 1` because the loop starts with `j` from `i` to `len(a) - 1`. The variable `j` increments with each iteration until it reaches `len(a) + (len(a) - 1)`, which is `2 * len(a) - 2`. The variable `sm` accumulates the sum of all elements in the list `a` since it starts adding elements from `a[j]` in each iteration. The list `cts` contains all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`, which means it will have `len(a)` elements, each representing the sum starting from that index to the end of the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is equal to `len(a)`, `sm` is equal to the sum of all elements from index `i` to the end of the list `a`, and `cts` is a list containing all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` remains as it was initially (`len(a) - 1`), but `j` will be one more than the last index processed, which is `len(a)`. The variable `sm` will hold the sum of all elements from index `i` to the end of the list `a`. The list `cts` will contain all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`, as each iteration appends the current cumulative sum to the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
