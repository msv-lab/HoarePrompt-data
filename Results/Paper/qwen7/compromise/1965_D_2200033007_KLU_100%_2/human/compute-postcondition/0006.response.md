Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed.
   - `smallList` has one less element.

3. **Determine what needs to change**:
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
     1. `len(smallList) > 0`
     2. `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - To ensure `len(smallList) > 0`, `smallList` must still have at least one element.
   - To ensure `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` must be the same.

Given that `smallList` has one less element, the last element of `smallList` was removed in the previous iteration. Therefore, to satisfy the condition `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, the last element of `bigList` must be the same as the last element of `smallList` before it was removed.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- Ensure `smallList` still has at least one element.
- Ensure `bigList[-1]` is the same as the last element of `smallList` before it was reduced by one.

Therefore, the final state should be:
State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, `smallList` has at least one element and the last element of `bigList` must be the same as the last element of `smallList` before it was reduced by one**.
