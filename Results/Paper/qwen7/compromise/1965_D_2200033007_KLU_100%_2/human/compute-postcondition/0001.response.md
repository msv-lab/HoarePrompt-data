Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`, with `smallList` having at least one element and the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`.**

Explanation: The code `bigList.pop()` removes the last element from `bigList`. Since `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` before the operation, after popping the last element, the condition `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` still holds true because `smallList` does not change. Therefore, the last element of `smallList` remains the same.
