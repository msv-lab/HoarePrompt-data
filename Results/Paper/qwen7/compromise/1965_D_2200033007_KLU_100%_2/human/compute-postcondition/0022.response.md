Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the value of `x` from the previous iteration, `idx` is `idx - 1`, `a[idx]` is updated to `x`.**

This means that the value of `a` at index `idx` has been updated to `x`, while the lists and variables `odds`, `prev`, and `idx` retain their previous states.
