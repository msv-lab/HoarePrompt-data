Output State: `bigList` is an empty list, `smallList` is a list of integers with all but one element removed, and the last element of `smallList` is one less than it was before the loop started.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `bigList` will be completely emptied since the condition `len(smallList) > 0` must still hold for the loop to continue, and once `smallList` becomes empty, the loop terminates. `smallList` will have all but one of its original elements removed, and the remaining element will be one less than its original value due to the repeated decrement during each iteration of the loop.
