Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, which represents the subarray sums of a palindrome array. It calculates the cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`, sorts these sums, and returns them as a new list. The returned list has the same length as the input list `a`, with each element representing the sorted cumulative sum from the corresponding index to the end of the list `a`.**
