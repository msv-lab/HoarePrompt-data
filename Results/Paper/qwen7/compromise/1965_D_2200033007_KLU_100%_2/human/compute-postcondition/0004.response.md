Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last two elements removed, `smallList` must have at least one element left**

Explanation: The code `bigList.pop()` removes the last element from `bigList`. Since `bigList` was initially a list of integers with the last element removed, after executing the code, `bigList` will have its last two elements removed. The state of `smallList` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the operation.
