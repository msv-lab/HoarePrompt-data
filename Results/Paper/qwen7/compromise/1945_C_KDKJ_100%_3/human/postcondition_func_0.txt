The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. It calculates and returns the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` while ensuring that the number of residents wanting to live on the left side up to index `i` is at least half of the number of positions considered so far, and the number of residents wanting to live on the right side from index `i` to the end is also at least half of the remaining positions.
