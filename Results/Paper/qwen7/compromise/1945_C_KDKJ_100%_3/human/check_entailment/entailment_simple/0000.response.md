### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
   - It calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string `a` and stores these counts in the list `S`.
   - After calculating `S`, it iterates through each possible position `i` to check if placing the road after house `i` satisfies the condition that at least half of the residents on both sides are satisfied.
   - For each position `i`, it checks:
     - If the number of '0's on the left (`left`) is at least half of the left side (`lsum`).
     - If the number of '1's on the right (`right`) is at least half of the right side (`rsum`).
   - If both conditions are met, it updates the answer `ans` to be the current position `i` if it is closer to the center than the previous answer or if it is the same distance but smaller.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This ensures that the logic of `func_1` is applied to each test case independently.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position `i` for the road placement.
   - It handles edge cases and ensures that the conditions are checked properly.
   - The output is consistent with the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handle all specified conditions.
