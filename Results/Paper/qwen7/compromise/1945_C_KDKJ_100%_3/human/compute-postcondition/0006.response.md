Output State: **`ans` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `S` is a list containing `n+1` sublists, where the first element of each sublist is the count of '0's encountered up to that point in the string `a`, and the second element is the count of '1's encountered up to that point.**

The code simply assigns the value `-1` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the initial state.
