Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. Specifically, the program always returns `ma - mi + 2`, which is not necessarily the minimum length required to turn all cells white.

Consider the test case "BBW". According to the problem description, the minimum length of the segment to be repainted is 2 (painting from the 1st to the 2nd cell). However, the program incorrectly calculates this as `ma - mi + 2`, which would be `3 - 1 + 2 = 4`.

To fix this, the program should find the shortest segment that includes all black cells. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    leftmost_black = float('inf')
    rightmost_black = -1
    has_black = False

    for i, j in enumerate(s):
        if j == 'B':
            leftmost_black = min(leftmost_black, i)
            rightmost_black = max(rightmost_black, i)
            has_black = True

    if not has_black:
        return 0
    else:
        return rightmost_black - leftmost_black + 1

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())
```

This corrected version properly identifies the shortest segment containing all black cells and returns its length.
