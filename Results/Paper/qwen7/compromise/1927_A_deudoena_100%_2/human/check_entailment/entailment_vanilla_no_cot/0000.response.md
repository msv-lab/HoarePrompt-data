Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the possibility of multiple segments of black cells within the strip. The current implementation only considers the first and last black cells, which is insufficient for calculating the minimum segment length needed to turn all cells white.

To fix this, the function should find the longest sequence of consecutive white cells and then calculate the length of the segment needed to cover any remaining black cells. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    # Find the longest sequence of consecutive white cells
    max_white_sequence = 0
    current_white_sequence = 0
    for j in s:
        if j == 'W':
            current_white_sequence += 1
        else:
            max_white_sequence = max(max_white_sequence, current_white_sequence)
            current_white_sequence = 0
    max_white_sequence = max(max_white_sequence, current_white_sequence)

    # Calculate the minimum segment length needed
    min_segment_length = m - max_white_sequence
    return min_segment_length + 1
```

This corrected function properly calculates the minimum segment length needed to turn all cells white by considering all sequences of white cells and finding the longest one.
