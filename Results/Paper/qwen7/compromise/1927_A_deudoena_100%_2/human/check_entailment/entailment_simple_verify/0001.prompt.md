You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that, when painted white, will make all cells in the strip white.
   - This means we need to find the shortest segment that includes the first black cell ('B') and the last black cell ('B').

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` and prints its result.
   - `func_1()` is supposed to calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.

3. **Analyzing `func_1()`**:
   - `ma` and `mi` are initialized to 0.
   - `m` is the length of the strip, read from input.
   - `s` is the string representing the strip, read from input.
   - `c` and `d` are counters initialized to 0.
   - `l` is an empty list (not used in the function, so it can be ignored).
   - The first loop finds the index of the first black cell ('B') and sets `mi` to `c + 1` (index starting from 1).
   - The second loop finds the index of the last black cell ('B') from the end and sets `ma` to `len(s) - d`.
   - The function returns `ma - mi + 2`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic to find the first black cell and the last black cell is correct.
   - However, the formula `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. It should be `ma - mi + 1` because the length of the segment is the difference between the indices plus one.
   - Additionally, the function does not handle cases where there are no black cells, which is not possible according to the problem statement but is worth noting.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct, but the formula for calculating the segment length is incorrect. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct results in all cases.

**Correctness: **False**
