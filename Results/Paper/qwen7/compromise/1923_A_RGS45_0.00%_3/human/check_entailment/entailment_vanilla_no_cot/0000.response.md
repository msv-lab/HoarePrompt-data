Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in the code is flawed. It tries to find the positions of the first and last chips (`x` and `y`) and then counts the zeros between them. However, this approach doesn't account for the optimal way to move chips to form a single block.

2. **Counting Zeros**: Counting zeros between the first and last chips does not guarantee the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block. For instance, in the test case `0 1 1 0 1 1 0`, the output should be `1`, but counting zeros would incorrectly give `2`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy involves moving each chip to the nearest free cell to the left until they are all adjacent. This requires a different approach, such as counting the number of chips to the right of each chip and summing these values.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        count = 0
        for i in range(n-1):
            if arr[i] == 1 and arr[i+1] == 0:
                count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This solution works by iterating through the array and counting the number of transitions from a chip (`1`) to a free cell (`0`). Each transition indicates an operation needed to move a chip to the left.
