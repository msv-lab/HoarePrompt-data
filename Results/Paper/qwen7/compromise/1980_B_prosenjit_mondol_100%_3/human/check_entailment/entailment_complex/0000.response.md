Reasoning:
- The function correctly processes each test case by reading the necessary inputs (`n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a`).
- It then sorts the list `a` in descending order.
- The function correctly compares the `k`-th largest element in the sorted list with the element at index `f`.
- Based on the comparison, the function prints the appropriate output ('YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE') according to the problem statement.
- The logic for determining whether the favorite cube will be removed or not is implemented correctly:
  - If the `k`-th largest element is greater than the element at index `f`, the function prints 'NO'.
  - If the `k`-th largest element is less than the element at index `f`, the function prints 'YES'.
  - If the `k`-th largest element is equal to the element at index `f`, the function further checks if the `k`-th element is the last element in the list; if so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.

Given the analysis, the function appears to handle all cases as described in the problem statement and the examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
