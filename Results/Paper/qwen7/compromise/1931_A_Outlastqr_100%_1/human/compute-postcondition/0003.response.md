Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, alphabet is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 78. After the loop executes all iterations, the value of `word` depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. Each iteration sets `word` based on the value of `n`, and prints the result. The final state of `word` will be the last printed value after all iterations.
