The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78). Based on the value of `n`, it constructs a string `word` using predefined rules and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the constructed strings `word` for each test case.
