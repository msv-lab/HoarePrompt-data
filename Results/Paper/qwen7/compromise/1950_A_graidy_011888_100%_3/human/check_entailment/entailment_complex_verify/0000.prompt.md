You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each line `i` (where `0 ≤ i < n`), the output will contain the result of the condition checks based on the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` entered for that iteration. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the output will reflect the results of the specified conditions for each set of inputs provided within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `n` sets of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9) and outputs one of three strings ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') for each set based on the given conditions. The function does not return any value. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged after the function executes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal. According to the problem description, if `a == b == c`, the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. For example, if the input is `0 0 0`, the program will output "STAIR" instead of "NONE".
