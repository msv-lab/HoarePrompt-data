Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is guaranteed to be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^3\).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop will continue as long as `i < t`, the loop will definitely execute if `t` is at least 1.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1, and `i` is set to 0 at the start of the loop.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is 0**
