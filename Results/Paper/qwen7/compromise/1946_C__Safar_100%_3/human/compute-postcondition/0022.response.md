Postcondition: **`stack` contains the tuples from the previous iteration plus the new tuple (`node`, `x`). Since the if condition checks if `node` is not equal to `p`, if the condition is true, the new tuple is added as is. If the condition is false, no action is taken and the stack remains unchanged.**
