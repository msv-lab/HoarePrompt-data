You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: `g[a]` now contains a list of all `b` values from the `edges` list, and `g[b]` now contains a list of all `a` values from the `edges` list. The length of both lists is equal to the number of edges in the `edges` list. `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and `edges` is a list of tuples representing all the edges in the tree.
    c = 0
    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `l` is greater than `r`.
    #
    #Explanation: The binary search algorithm continues to narrow down the range defined by `l` and `r` until no more valid midpoints can be found that satisfy the condition of the `check(mid)` function. Since the loop continues to adjust `l` and `r` based on the result of `check(mid)`, it will eventually reach a point where `l` becomes greater than `r`. At this point, the loop terminates, indicating that the search space has been exhausted without finding a value that satisfies the `check(mid)` condition.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is the last value of r before l became greater than r)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `edges`. It returns information based on removing `k` edges from a tree with `n` vertices, where each edge is represented in `edges` as a tuple (a, b).

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
