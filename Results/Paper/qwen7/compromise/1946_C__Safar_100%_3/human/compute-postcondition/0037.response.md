Output State: `l` is greater than `r`.

Explanation: The binary search algorithm continues to narrow down the range defined by `l` and `r` until no more valid midpoints can be found that satisfy the condition of the `check(mid)` function. Since the loop continues to adjust `l` and `r` based on the result of `check(mid)`, it will eventually reach a point where `l` becomes greater than `r`. At this point, the loop terminates, indicating that the search space has been exhausted without finding a value that satisfies the `check(mid)` condition.
