Output State: **`A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree where keys are vertex IDs and values are lists of adjacent vertices, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n - 1, `stack` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1), `visited` is an empty set, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes a dictionary `d` with a single key-value pair `(1, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
