Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `node` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over all nodes in `g[x]`. The loop continues as long as there are nodes in `g[x]`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `node` is not equal to `p`.
   - If `node` is not equal to `p`, then `stack` contains the tuple (`node`, `x`).

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `node` must be a different node from `p` (since it already processed one such node).
   - The `stack` should contain the tuple of the new `node` and `x`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `node` will be set to the next node in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`.
   - `stack` will contain the tuple of this new `node` and `x`.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`node` is a node in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`, and `stack` contains the tuple (`node`, `x`) if `node` is not equal to `p`.**
