Output State: **`node` is not equal to `p`; `stack` contains the tuple (`node`, `x`).**

Explanation: The code `stack.append((node, x))` appends a tuple containing `node` and `x` to the list `stack`. Since `node` is not equal to `p`, and the values of `node`, `p`, and `x` remain unchanged, the only new information is that the tuple `(node, x)` has been added to `stack`.
