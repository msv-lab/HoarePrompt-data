Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and prints it, but this does not maximize the beauty of the array according to the given formula. 

To maximize the beauty, we need to arrange the array such that the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) are maximized. Sorting the array and simply printing it does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty. For example, consider the input:

```
3
100 54 80
```

Sorting the array gives us `[54, 80, 100]`, and the beauty calculated as \( (80 - 54) + (100 - 80) = 26 + 20 = 46 \).

However, the optimal arrangement would be `[100, 54, 80]`, which gives the beauty \( (100 - 54) + (80 - 100) = 46 + (-20) = 26 \). This shows that sorting alone does not achieve the maximum beauty.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
