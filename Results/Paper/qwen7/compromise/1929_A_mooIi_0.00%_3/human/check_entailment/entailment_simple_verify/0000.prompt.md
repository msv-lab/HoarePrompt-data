You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(' '.join(ar))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of the sorted versions of the lists of integers provided in each test case, with the integers converted to strings and joined by spaces. Each test case's output will be printed on a new line. The number of test cases is determined by the first input, and for each test case, the number of integers \( n \) is provided, followed by the list of \( n \) integers. The integers in each list are sorted in ascending order before being converted to strings and printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and prints it, but this does not maximize the beauty of the array according to the given formula. 

To maximize the beauty, we need to arrange the array such that the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) are maximized. Sorting the array and simply printing it does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty. For example, consider the input:

```
3
100 54 80
```

Sorting the array gives us `[54, 80, 100]`, and the beauty calculated as \( (80 - 54) + (100 - 80) = 26 + 20 = 46 \).

However, the optimal arrangement would be `[100, 54, 80]`, which gives the beauty \( (100 - 54) + (80 - 100) = 46 + (-20) = 26 \). This shows that sorting alone does not achieve the maximum beauty.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
