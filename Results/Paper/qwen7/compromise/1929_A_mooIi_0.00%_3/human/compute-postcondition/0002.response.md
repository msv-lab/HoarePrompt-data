Output State: The output state will consist of the sorted versions of the lists of integers provided in each test case, with the integers converted to strings and joined by spaces. Each test case's output will be printed on a new line. The number of test cases is determined by the first input, and for each test case, the number of integers \( n \) is provided, followed by the list of \( n \) integers. The integers in each list are sorted in ascending order before being converted to strings and printed.
