The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by an integer \( n \) indicating the number of integers in the list. It then reads \( n \) integers for each test case, sorts them in ascending order, converts each integer to a string, and prints the sorted list as a space-separated string on a new line for each test case. The function implicitly accepts input through standard input and outputs results through standard output.
