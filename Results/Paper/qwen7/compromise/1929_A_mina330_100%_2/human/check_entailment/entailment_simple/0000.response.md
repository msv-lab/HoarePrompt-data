Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
2. The given solution sorts the array and prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This approach works because the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. In this configuration, the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \) are maximized.
3. Specifically, after sorting, the beauty of the array is simply \( a_n - a_1 \), which is the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.
4. The code correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by sorting the array, and prints the required result for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
