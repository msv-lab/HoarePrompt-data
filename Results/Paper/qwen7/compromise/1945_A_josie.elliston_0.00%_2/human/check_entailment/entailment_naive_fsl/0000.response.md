Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and another extrovert. Specifically, consider the test case `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal):

- According to `func_1`, for 4 extroverts and 1 universal, the function returns `ceil((4 + 1) / 3) = 2`. This means 2 tents are allocated for these 5 people.
- However, this leaves 2 extroverts without a tent, as they cannot form a group of 3 with the remaining universal.

Thus, the program incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `-1` for this case. Therefore, the program is not correct.
