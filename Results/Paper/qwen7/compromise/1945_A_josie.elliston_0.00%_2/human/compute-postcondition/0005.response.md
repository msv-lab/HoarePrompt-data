Output State: **The program returns the ceiling value of (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, given that extroverts modulo 3 is not equal to 0 and (extroverts % 3 + universals) is greater than or equal to 3.**

This means the program will return the smallest integer greater than or equal to the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3, but only if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts` modulo 3 and `universals` is 3 or more.
