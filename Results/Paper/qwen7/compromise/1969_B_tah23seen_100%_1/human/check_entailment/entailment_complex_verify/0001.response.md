### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Processing Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is designed to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s` in non-descending order.
   - The logic inside the function is as follows:
     - Initialize `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
     - Iterate through each character in the string `s`.
       - If the character is '1', increment the counter `one`.
       - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' before (i.e., `one > 0`), add `one + 1` to the cost.
   - The logic in `func_1(s)` is indeed correct for calculating the minimum cost. Here's why:
     - Each '0' that appears after the first '1' must be moved to the left of all '1's to sort the string.
     - Moving a '0' past a '1' requires a cyclic shift of the substring from the '0' to the '1'.
     - The cost of moving a '0' past all '1's it needs to pass is `one + 1`, where `one` is the count of '1's seen so far.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted, as the cost calculation will be zero in such cases.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as strings that are already sorted (`0000`, `1111`, etc.), where the cost is zero.
   - The function also correctly handles strings that start with '0' followed by '1's, ensuring the cost is calculated accurately.

4. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and uses the function `func_1(s)` to calculate the minimum cost.
   - The function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the minimum cost based on the given logic.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
