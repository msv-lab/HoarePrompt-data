Reasoning:
1. The given program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
2. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(s)` with the binary string `s`.
3. The function `func_1(s)` calculates the minimum cost to sort the string in non-descending order using the defined operations.
   - It initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments the counter `one`.
     - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' before (i.e., `one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the cost.
4. The logic in `func_1(s)` is correct for calculating the minimum cost. Here's why:
   - Each '0' that appears after the first '1' must be moved to the left of all '1's to sort the string.
   - Moving a '0' past a '1' requires a cyclic shift of the substring from the '0' to the '1'.
   - The cost of moving a '0' past all '1's it needs to pass is `one + 1`, where `one` is the count of '1's seen so far.
5. The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted, but this is not necessary since the function correctly calculates the cost for any binary string.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
