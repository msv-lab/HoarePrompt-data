Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing either 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions evaluated for each set of inputs (a, b, c) provided by the user. The value of `t` is determined by the user's initial input, which specifies how many times the loop will run. Each line corresponds to the result of one iteration of the loop, depending on whether `a < b < c`, `a < b > c`, or neither condition is met.
