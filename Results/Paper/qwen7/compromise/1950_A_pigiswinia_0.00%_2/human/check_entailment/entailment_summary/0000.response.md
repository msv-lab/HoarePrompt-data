Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case and reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The program checks if the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) or a peak (`a < b > c`) are met.
4. If the conditions are met, it prints the corresponding string ('STAIRS' or 'PEAK').
5. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
6. The program does not return any value after processing all test cases, which is acceptable since no return statement is required in this context.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the provided program appears to be functioning as intended based on the example inputs and outputs.

Correctness: **True**
