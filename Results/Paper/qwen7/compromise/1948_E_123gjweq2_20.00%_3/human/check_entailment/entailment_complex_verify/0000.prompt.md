You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

    #This is printed: ceil(n / k)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: - The `print(*cliquess)` statement will print the elements of `cliquess` separated by spaces. Since `cliquess` is a list of `n` zeros, the output will be `0 0 0 ... 0` (with `n` zeros).

    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * `n`. It populates an array `arr` and a list `cliquess` based on the value of `cliques`, which is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`. After populating `arr`, the function prints the contents of `arr`, the value of `cliques`, and the list `cliquess` filled with zeros. The final state of the program includes the printed values of `arr`, `cliques`, and `cliquess`.

    #State: Output State: `left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr` is a list where for each index `i` in the range `[left, left + mid - 1]`, `arr[i] = small_element + i` and `cliquess[i] = clique`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts two integers `left` and `right` (where `left < right`), and an integer `clique`. It constructs an array `arr` and populates it with values ranging from `left + 1` to `right` in a specific pattern. For each index `i` in the first half of the range, it sets `arr[i]` to `left + 1 + i` and associates the `clique` identifier with that index. For the second half of the range, it sets `arr[i]` to `right` minus the corresponding offset and again associates the `clique` identifier. The function also updates another array `cliquess` to store the `clique` identifier for each index in the specified range. After executing the function, the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` contain the specified values based on the given `left`, `right`, and `clique` parameters.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques based on the given constraints. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly handle the assignment of integers to vertices and the formation of cliques according to the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \). According to the problem description, the graph should be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. However, the current implementation assigns integers to vertices without ensuring that the resulting graph can indeed be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

For example, if the program assigns the integers as follows:
- \( a_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = 2 \)
- \( a_3 = 3 \)
- \( a_4 = 4 \)
- \( a_5 = 5 \)

Then, the edges between vertices would be formed as follows:
- For vertices 1 and 2: \( |1 - 2| + |1 - 2| = 2 \le 4 \) (edge exists)
- For vertices 1 and 3: \( |1 - 3| + |1 - 3| = 4 \le 4 \) (edge exists)
- For vertices 1 and 4: \( |1 - 4| + |1 - 4| = 6 \not\le 4 \) (no edge)
- For vertices 1 and 5: \( |1 - 5| + |1 - 5| = 8 \not\le 4 \) (no edge)
- For vertices 2 and 3: \( |2 - 3| + |2 - 3| = 2 \le 4 \) (edge exists)
- For vertices 2 and 4: \( |2 - 4| + |2 - 4| = 4 \le 4 \) (edge exists)
- For vertices 2 and 5: \( |2 - 5| + |2 - 5| = 6 \not\le 4 \) (no edge)
- For vertices 3 and 4: \( |3 - 4| + |3 - 4| = 2 \le 4 \) (edge exists)
- For vertices 3 and 5: \( |3 - 5| + |3 - 5| = 4 \le 4 \) (edge exists)
- For vertices 4 and 5: \( |4 - 5| + |4 - 5| = 2 \le 4 \) (edge exists)

From this, we can see that vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4 form a clique, but vertex 5 does not connect to any of these vertices within the given constraint. Therefore, the graph cannot be partitioned into just one clique, and the program does not handle this case correctly.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not ensure that the graph can always be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques as required by the problem description.
