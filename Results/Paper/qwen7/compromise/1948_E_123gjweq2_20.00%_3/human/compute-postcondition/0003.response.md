Output State: **`left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`**.

Explanation: The variable `not_mid` is assigned the value of `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given that `mid` is already calculated as `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2`, `not_mid` becomes `right - left + 1 - ((right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
