Functionality: **The function `make_array` accepts two integers `left` and `right` (where `left < right`), and an integer `clique`. It constructs an array `arr` and populates it with values ranging from `left + 1` to `right` in a specific pattern. For each index `i` in the first half of the range, it sets `arr[i]` to `left + 1 + i` and associates the `clique` identifier with that index. For the second half of the range, it sets `arr[i]` to `right` minus the corresponding offset and again associates the `clique` identifier. The function also updates another array `cliquess` to store the `clique` identifier for each index in the specified range. After executing the function, the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` contain the specified values based on the given `left`, `right`, and `clique` parameters.**
