Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
2. It checks if both `letters` and `digits` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. It ensures that there are no instances where a letter is followed by a digit.
4. The logic flow is correct and matches the problem requirements.

Given the provided annotated program, the function `func_1` correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the function will return the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
