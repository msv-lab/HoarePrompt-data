Output State: `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`. The loop checks each pair of consecutive characters in the string `password` to see if a letter is followed by a digit. If such a pair is found, the function returns 'NO'. If no such pair is found after checking all possible pairs, the function does not return anything, implying it returns 'YES' implicitly.
