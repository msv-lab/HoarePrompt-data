Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and pairs of positive integers a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of a, b, and t.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t` and pairs of values for `a` and `b`. The function does not accept `t`, `a`, or `b` as direct parameters but uses them within the function to determine the output for each test case.
