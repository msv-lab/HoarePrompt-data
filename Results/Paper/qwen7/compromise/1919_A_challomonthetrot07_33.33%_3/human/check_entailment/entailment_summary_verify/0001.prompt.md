You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 1
    
    1 4
    
    5 3
    
    4 5

    83 91

    839204 7281
    
    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( T \) and pairs of positive integers \( a \) and \( b \). For each test case, it prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on specific conditions involving \( a \) and \( b \). The possible outputs are determined as follows: if \( a \) equals \( b \), it prints 'Bob'; if \( a \) equals 1, it prints 'Alice'; if \( b \) equals 1, it prints 'Bob'; if \( a \) is odd, it prints 'Bob'; if \( a \) is even and \( b \) is odd, it prints 'Alice'; if \( a \) is greater than \( b \), it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The program checks if `a` (Alice's coins) is equal to `b` (Bob's coins). If they are equal, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if both have the same number of coins, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he wins.
   
3. **Single Coin Condition**:
   - If `a` is 1, it prints "Alice". This is correct because if Alice has 1 coin and Bob has any number of coins, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin.
   
4. **Single Coin for Bob**:
   - If `b` is 1, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if Bob has 1 coin and Alice has any number of coins, Bob can force Alice into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin.
   
5. **Odd Number of Coins for Alice**:
   - If `a` is odd, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if Alice has an odd number of coins, she can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin, leaving Bob with an even number of coins.
   
6. **Even Number of Coins for Alice and Odd Number of Coins for Bob**:
   - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints "Alice". This is correct because if Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin, leaving Bob with an even number of coins.
   
7. **More Coins for Alice**:
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if Alice has more coins than Bob, she can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin, leaving Bob with fewer coins.
   
8. **Else Case**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "Alice". This is correct because if none of the above conditions hold, the remaining cases imply that Alice has fewer coins than Bob and an even number of coins, which means Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin.

### Conclusion

After analyzing each condition and its logic, the program appears to handle all possible scenarios correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the given program is correct.
