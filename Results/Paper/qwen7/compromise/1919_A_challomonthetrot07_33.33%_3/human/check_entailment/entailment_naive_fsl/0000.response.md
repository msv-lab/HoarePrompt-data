Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal strategy for both players when the number of coins in their wallets is odd or even in a more general sense.

Let's analyze the given solution and identify the issue:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - If `a == b`, the program prints 'Bob'.
   - If `a == 1`, the program prints 'Alice'.
   - If `b == 1`, the program prints 'Bob'.
   - If `a % 2 == 1`, the program prints 'Bob'.
   - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, the program prints 'Alice'.
   - If `a > b`, the program prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, the program prints 'Alice'.

2. **Issue Identification**:
   - The solution does not fully capture the optimal strategy for both players. For instance, it does not account for the fact that if both players have an odd number of coins, the player whose turn it is can always force a win by playing optimally.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the case where `a = 3` and `b = 3`. Both players start with an odd number of coins. According to the optimal strategy, the player whose turn it is can always force a win by ensuring that the opponent is left with an even number of coins. However, the program incorrectly prints 'Bob' in this case.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to consider the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        total_coins = a + b
        if total_coins % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the total number of coins is even or odd and determines the winner based on that. If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This handles all potential cases correctly.
