Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is incremented for each '@' character found in `b`, and the loop breaks if any '*' character is encountered.**

In this final state, the loop will have iterated through every character in the string `b`. The variable `j` will be equal to the length of `b` because the loop increments `j` for each character processed. For each character in `b`, if it is '@', the counter `s` is incremented. However, if the loop encounters a '*' character, it will break immediately, stopping further iterations. Therefore, `s` will only be incremented for '@' characters up to the point where a '*' is encountered, if any.
