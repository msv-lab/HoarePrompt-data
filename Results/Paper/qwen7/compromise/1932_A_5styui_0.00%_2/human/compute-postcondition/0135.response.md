Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `b`.

2. **Understand the postconditions at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is 2 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', otherwise `s` is 1.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `i` is the length of `b`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - The value of `s` depends on the character at index `j + 1` in `b`. If it is '*', `s` will be 2; otherwise, it will be 1.
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is the length of `b` and does not change within the loop.

Given these points, let's construct the new state for the next iteration:

- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `s` will depend on the character at index `j + 1` in `b`.
- `i` remains the same (length of `b`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is 2 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', otherwise `s` is 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `i` is the length of `b`**.
