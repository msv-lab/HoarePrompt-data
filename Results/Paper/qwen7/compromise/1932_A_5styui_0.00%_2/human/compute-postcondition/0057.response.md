Output State: **`j` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index 0 of `b` is '@', `s` is 1**.

The code `s = s + 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. Initially, `s` is not defined, so it is assumed to be 0 (based on the initial state where `j` is 0 and no other variable `s` is mentioned). After executing the code, `s` becomes 1. The values of `j` and `b` remain unchanged.
