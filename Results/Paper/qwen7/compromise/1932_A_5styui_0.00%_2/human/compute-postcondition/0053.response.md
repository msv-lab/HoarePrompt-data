Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer.**

The code `d = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input to the variable `d`. The initial values of `s`, `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The input for `d` is unspecified, so it is represented as an input integer.
