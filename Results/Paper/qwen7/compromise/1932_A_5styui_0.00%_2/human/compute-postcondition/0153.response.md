Functionality: **The function processes input data for up to 1000 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a string of length n containing '.', '@', and '*', counts the number of '@' characters (representing coins) in the string, and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function ends with all relevant variables reset.**
