Output State: **`j` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j` of `b` is '*', and the slice `b[:]` is truthy and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement indicated in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we know a `break` statement was encountered. All other variables retain their initial states.
