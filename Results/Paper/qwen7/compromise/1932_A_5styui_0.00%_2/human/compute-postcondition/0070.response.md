Postcondition: `j` is 0, `b` is a non-empty string, and the character at index `j` of `b` is either '*', or it is not '*', and `b[:]` is False. If the character at index `j` of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `j` of `b` is not '*', the conditions remain unchanged.
