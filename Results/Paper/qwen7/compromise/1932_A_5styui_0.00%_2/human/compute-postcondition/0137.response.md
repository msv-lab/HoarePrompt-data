Output State: **`s` is 2 if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', otherwise `s` is 1, `j` is `j + 1`, `i` is the length of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement we were inside. The values of the variables `s`, `j`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
