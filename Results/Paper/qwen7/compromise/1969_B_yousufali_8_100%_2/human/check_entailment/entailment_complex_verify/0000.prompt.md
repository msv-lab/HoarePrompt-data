You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (consisting only of '0's and '1's), and the length of s is at least 2.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is an input binary string, `n` is 0, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for every occurrence of '0' in `s` that follows at least one '1'.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the count of '0's in s that follow at least one '1')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a binary string from the user, counts the number of '0's that are immediately followed by at least one '1', and prints the total count. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a binary string s is provided where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and s_i ∈ {0, 1}.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: t remains the same; s remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1()` to process a binary string `s` of length between 2 and 200,000 characters containing only '0's and '1's. After processing all test cases, it does not modify the values of `t` or `s`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Specifically, consider the input `101011`. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would involve multiple cyclic shifts to sort the string, but the current implementation does not account for this. Instead, it counts the number of zeros followed by ones, which does not reflect the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

For example, for the input `101011`, the optimal solution involves the following steps:
1. Choose the substring `[3, 5]` and perform a cyclic shift: `101011 -> 110101`.
2. Choose the substring `[1, 2]` and perform a cyclic shift: `110101 -> 011011`.

The total cost is `4 + 2 = 6`, but the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `11` because it simply counts the number of zeros followed by ones without considering the actual cost of cyclic shifts.
