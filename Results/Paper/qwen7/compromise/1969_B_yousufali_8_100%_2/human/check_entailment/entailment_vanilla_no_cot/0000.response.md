Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the minimum cost required to sort the binary string through cyclic shifts of substrings. Instead, it seems to be attempting to count the number of '0's that appear after at least one '1', which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string by performing cyclic shifts. Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

1. Identify the position where the first '1' appears.
2. Identify the position where the last '0' appears.
3. Calculate the cost of shifting the substring from the start up to the first '1' to the end, and then shifting the rest of the string to sort it.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input().strip()
    n = len(s)
    
    # Find the index of the first '1'
    first_one_index = None
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            first_one_index = i
            break
    
    # If there are no '1's, the string is already sorted
    if first_one_index is None:
        print(0)
        return
    
    # Find the index of the last '0'
    last_zero_index = None
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            last_zero_index = i
            break
    
    # Calculate the cost
    cost = 0
    if first_one_index > 0:
        cost += first_one_index + 1
    if last_zero_index < n - 1:
        cost += n - last_zero_index
    
    print(cost)

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Call the function with the input
func_2()
```

This code correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by considering the positions of the first '1' and the last '0'.
