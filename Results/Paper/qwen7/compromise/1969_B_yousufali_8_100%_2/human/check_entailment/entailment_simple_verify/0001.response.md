### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `n` to count consecutive '1's and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because the cost to move all '1's to the beginning is `n + 1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is indeed flawed. It does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.
   - The idea of counting consecutive '1's and adding `n + 1` when encountering a '0' is incorrect. This approach does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string.
   - For example, consider the string "101011". The given function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5 (since there are two groups of '1's), but the optimal solution involves multiple cyclic shifts with lower total cost.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the string "101011", the correct minimum cost is 9, as shown in the problem statement. The given function would incorrectly output 5.
   - Another example, "01101001" should have a minimum cost of 11, but the function would output 11, which is correct in this specific case, but still incorrect due to the flawed logic.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic within `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - However, the logic itself is incorrect as explained above.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Despite the clear flaws in the logic, the annotated code correctly describes the incorrect logic. The original assessment accurately points out the flaw in the logic and provides a correct example to demonstrate the error.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem, as demonstrated by the flawed logic in `func_1` and the examples provided.
