Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers n, m, and k such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), and k is even. Additionally, for each test case, there are n integers in the second element of the tuple representing array a, and m integers in the third element of the tuple representing array b, with each element of arrays a and b being an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The sum of values n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4⋅10^5.**
