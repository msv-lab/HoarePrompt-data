### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine if it's possible to select exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from each of two arrays such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the chosen elements.

2. **Key Steps in the Code**:
   - The code processes each test case individually.
   - It identifies unique elements in both arrays that are less than or equal to \( k \).
   - It categorizes these elements into those exclusive to array \( a \) (`only_a`), those exclusive to array \( b \) (`only_b`), and those present in both (`both`).
   - It checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \). If so, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It also checks if the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is at least \( k \). If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - If neither condition is violated, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Condition Checking**: The logic correctly checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \). This ensures that we do not pick more than half of \( k \) from one array alone.
   - **Distinct Elements Check**: The logic also correctly checks if the total number of distinct elements is at least \( k \). This ensures that all numbers from 1 to \( k \) are covered.
   - **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases where the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \) or the total number of distinct elements is less than \( k \).

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The output format matches the requirements: 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
   - The conditions are correctly applied, ensuring the program outputs the correct result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose the required elements from the arrays. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
