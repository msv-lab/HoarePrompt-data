Output State: **The program returns a list 'results' that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, if the number of elements in 'only_a' or 'only_b' exceeds k // 2, or the total number of distinct elements in 'only_a', 'only_b', and 'both' is less than k, then 'NO' is appended to the 'results' list for that test case. Otherwise, 'YES' is appended.**

This output state describes the final state of the `results` list after evaluating each test case according to the specified conditions. The list will contain 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, depending on whether the conditions are met or not.
