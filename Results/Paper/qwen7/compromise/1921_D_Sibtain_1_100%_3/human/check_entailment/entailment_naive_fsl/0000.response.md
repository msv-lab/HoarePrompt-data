Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the arrays `a` and `c` contain duplicate values correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that `a` and `c` will always have unique elements, which is not guaranteed by the problem statement. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
4 6
1 1 1 1
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

The program will sort `a` and `c` and then pair the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `c`, and vice versa. However, since all elements in `a` are the same, the program will incorrectly calculate the differences, leading to an incorrect result. The correct approach would be to handle duplicates properly, ensuring that the maximum difference is calculated for each element in `a` against the corresponding elements in `c`.

A correct implementation would need to account for the possibility of duplicate values in both `a` and `c`.
