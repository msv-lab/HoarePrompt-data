Output State: **`k` is 1, `len(a)` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`**.

Explanation: The code `ans += max(t1, t2)` adds the maximum value between `t1` and `t2` to `ans`. Since `t1` and `t2` are defined as the absolute differences between elements of arrays `a` and `c`, and there is only one element in each array (`a[0]` and `c[0]`), `t1` and `t2` are already calculated. The value of `ans` is updated to include the maximum of these two values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
