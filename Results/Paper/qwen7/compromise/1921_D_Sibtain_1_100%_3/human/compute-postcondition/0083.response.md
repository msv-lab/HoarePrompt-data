Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, `k` is 3**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 1, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 2. The values of `j`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
