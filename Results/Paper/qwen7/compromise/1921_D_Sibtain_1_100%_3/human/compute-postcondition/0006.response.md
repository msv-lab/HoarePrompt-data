The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no loop was specified in the code snippet, and given the initial state, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect these variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
