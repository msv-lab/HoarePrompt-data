Output State: **`k` is 2, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, `j` is increased by 1 if `t2` is greater than `t1`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, and `i` is increased by 1 if `t2` is not greater than `t1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += max(t1, t2)` updates the value of `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to it. The values of `k`, `j`, `t1`, `t2`, `a`, `c`, `i` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The conditions for updating `j`, `t1`, `t2`, and `i` remain the same as they were before the code execution.
