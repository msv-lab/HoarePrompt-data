Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `m` are integers from the input.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with only one element.
- `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order.
- The length of `a` is 1.

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. `a[0]`: Since `a` is a list with only one element, `a[0]` is the single integer in the list `a`.

2. `max(c)`: Since `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `max(c)` is the largest integer in the list `c`.

3. `min(c)`: Since `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `min(c)` is the smallest integer in the list `c`.

4. `abs(a[0] - max(c))`: This computes the absolute difference between the single element in `a` and the maximum element in `c`.

5. `abs(a[0] - min(c))`: This computes the absolute difference between the single element in `a` and the minimum element in `c`.

6. `max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c)))`: This takes the larger of the two absolute differences computed above.

Since `a` has only one element, let's denote it as `x`. Therefore, the expression simplifies to finding the maximum of `|x - \text{max}(c)|` and `|x - \text{min}(c)|`.

The output will be the larger of these two values.

Output: **max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))) (where a[0] is the single element in the list a and c is a list of integers sorted in descending order)**
