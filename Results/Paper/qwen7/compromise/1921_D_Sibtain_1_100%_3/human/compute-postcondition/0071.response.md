Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for k in range(len(a))`. The only variable in the loop head is `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `k`**: Since the loop starts from `k = 0` (as per the `range(len(a))`), and at the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1, it means the loop has already executed once.

3. **Determine the next state of `k`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be 2.

4. **Adjust the other variables**: The other variables (`i`, `j`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`) are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body. Since no modifications to these variables are mentioned in the loop head, they retain their previous values.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
   - `i` remains 1
   - `j` remains 1
   - `ans` remains `ans + max(t1, t2)`
   - `t1` retains its initial value
   - `t2` retains its initial value
   - `k` is now 2

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`, `t1` retains its initial value, `t2` retains its initial value, `k` is 2**
