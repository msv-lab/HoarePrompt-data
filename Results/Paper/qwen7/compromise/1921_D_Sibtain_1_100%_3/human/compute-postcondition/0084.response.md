Postcondition: `i`, `j`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, and `k` retain their initial values. If `t2 > t1`, then `i` becomes 1 and `j` becomes 3, and `ans` is updated to `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`. Otherwise, `i` remains 1, `j` stays 2, and `ans` is still `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`.
