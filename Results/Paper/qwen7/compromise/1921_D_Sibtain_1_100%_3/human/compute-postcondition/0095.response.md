The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The variables `i`, `j`, `ans`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a` plus the max value for the current iteration (which is the fourth iteration), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created by mapping integers from input, `c` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**
