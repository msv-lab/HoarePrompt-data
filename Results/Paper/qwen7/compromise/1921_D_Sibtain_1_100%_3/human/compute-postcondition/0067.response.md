Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `t1` is abs(`a[0]` - `c[0]`), `t2` is abs(`a[len(a) - 1]` - `c[len(c) - 1]`).**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The values of `j`, `ans`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
