Output State: **`k` is 0, `t1` is abs(a[i] - c[i]), `t2` is abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` to the variable `t2`. The values of `k` and `t1` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `k` is still 0, and `t1` retains its initial value of `abs(a[i] - c[i])`. The value of `t2` is now determined by the expression `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.
