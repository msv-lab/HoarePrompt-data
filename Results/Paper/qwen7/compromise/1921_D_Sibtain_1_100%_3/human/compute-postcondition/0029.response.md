Output State: **`k` is 1, `len(a)` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), abs(a[0] - c[0]))`**

Explanation: The code calculates `t2` as `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`. Given that `len(a)` is 1, both `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]` simplify to `a[0]` and `c[0]` respectively, since `j` would be 0 in this case (as `len(a)` is 1). Thus, `t2` is set to `abs(a[0] - c[0])`. The values of `k`, `len(a)`, `t1`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
