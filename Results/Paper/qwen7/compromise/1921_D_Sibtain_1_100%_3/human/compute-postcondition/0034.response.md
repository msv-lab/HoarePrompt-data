Output State: **`k` is 1, `len(a)` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), abs(a[0] - c[0])) + max(t1, t2)`, either `j` is increased by 1 if `t2 > t1`, or `i` is increased by 1 if `t2 <= t1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += max(t1, t2)` updates the value of `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to its current value. The values of `k`, `len(a)`, `t1`, `t2`, and the condition for updating `i` or `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.
