The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The length of `a` is now the number of integers entered. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `ans`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is decremented by 1, `m` is an input integer, `k` is equal to the length of list `a`, `len(a)` is the number of integers entered, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `i` and `j` are both equal to the length of list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**
