Output State: **`k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `ans` is increased by `t1`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was part of the calculation for `t1` as `abs(a[i] - c[i])`. After incrementing `i` by 1, `i` now refers to the next index in the list `a` and `c`. The values of `k`, `t2`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
