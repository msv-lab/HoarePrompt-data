Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, and x. It also implicitly processes y which is always 0. For each test case, t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, and x is an integer between 2 and the minimum of n or 2 * 10^5. The function returns information about the test cases based on the given constraints.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing specific integers t, n, x, and y (which is always 0). It validates these integers against the provided constraints and returns information based on these validations.
