Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `y` is an integer input from the user**.

The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial state of these variables is now set to the integers input by the user.
