Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`**

Explanation: The code does not change the values of the variables `i` and `num`. It simply reassigns the value of `num` to itself, which means the value of `num` remains `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`. The value of `i` stays as `x - 1`.
