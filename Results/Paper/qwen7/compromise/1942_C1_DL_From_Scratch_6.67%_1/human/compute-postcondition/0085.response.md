Output State: **`i` is equal to `x - 2`, `num` is equal to 1, `count` is equal to 2**

Explanation: The variable `count` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially set to the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution (which is 1 based on the initial state), it now equals 2. The values of `i` and `num` remain unchanged.
