Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `x - 2`
- `num` is equal to 1
- `count` is equal to 2

The condition `num == 1` is true, so the values of `i`, `num`, and `count` are maintained.

The expression to be evaluated in the `print` statement is `count + x - 2`.

Given that `count` is 2, and `x - 2` is the value of `i`, we substitute `i` for `x - 2` in the expression:

\[ \text{print}(2 + x - 2) \]

Simplifying the expression inside the `print` statement:

\[ \text{print}(x) \]

So, the output will be the value of `x`.

Output: **x**
