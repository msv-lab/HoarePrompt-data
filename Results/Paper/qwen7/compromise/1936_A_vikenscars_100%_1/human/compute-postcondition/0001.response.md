State: **`max_item_idx` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `1 <= i < n` must be true at the start of the first iteration.
3. Initially, `i` is set to 1 in the `range(1, n)` function.
4. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to start executing.
5. The variable `max_item_idx` is not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 1 (since `i` starts at 1) and within the given range, while `max_item_idx` remains as 0 and `i` is set to 1.
