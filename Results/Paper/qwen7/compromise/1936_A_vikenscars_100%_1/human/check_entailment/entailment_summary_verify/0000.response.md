### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
- We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form \((p_a \mid p_b)\) vs \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
- The program must terminate after finding the indices and output them.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function prints a query and reads the response.
   - It takes four indices \(a, b, c, d\) and returns the comparison result as a string ("<", "=", ">").

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the indices \(max_item_idx\) and `pair_idx` such that \(p_{max_item_idx} \oplus p_{pair_idx}\) is maximized.
   - It first identifies `max_item_idx` by comparing elements using `func_1`.
   - Then, it tries to find `pair_idx` by further comparisons involving `max_item_idx`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Finding `max_item_idx`**:
   - The program correctly identifies the index of the maximum element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum using `func_1`.
   - This step ensures that `max_item_idx` points to the element with the highest value in the permutation.

2. **Finding `pair_idx`**:
   - The program then tries to find another index `pair_idx` that maximizes the XOR with `max_item_idx`.
   - It compares `max_item_idx` with each other index `i` and uses additional queries to refine the choice of `pair_idx`.
   - This step is more complex and involves multiple comparisons to ensure that the chosen `pair_idx` maximizes the XOR.

3. **Query Limitations**:
   - The program adheres to the constraint of making at most \(3n\) queries.
   - While the logic is intricate, it is designed to efficiently narrow down the potential candidates for the maximum XOR pair.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_2` correctly identifies the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` and prints them in the required format.

#### Evaluation:
- The original assessment stated that the program does not guarantee finding the optimal pair of indices due to potential flaws in the logic.
- However, upon closer inspection, the program's approach is logically sound and adheres to the constraints.
- The program uses a combination of direct comparisons and additional queries to ensure that the maximum XOR pair is found.
- Given the problem constraints and the logical structure of the program, it is reasonable to conclude that the program will find the correct pair of indices within the allowed queries.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct and adheres to the problem constraints and requirements. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.
