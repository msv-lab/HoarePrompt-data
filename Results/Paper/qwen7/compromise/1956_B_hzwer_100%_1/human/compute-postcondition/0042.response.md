Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `x` which is iterating over the elements of `cnt`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `cnt` to iterate over.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cnt` must contain at least one element.
   - `ans` is increased by `max(0, x - 1)` where `x` is the current element being iterated over in `cnt`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `cnt` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue, and assuming we are at the end of an iteration, `cnt` must still contain at least one element.
   - `ans` is updated based on the value of `x` from the previous iteration. For the loop to execute again, `cnt` must have another element, and `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `cnt` must contain at least two elements (since it contained at least one element before and now needs to have another element for the loop to continue).
   - `ans` will be updated by `max(0, x - 1)` where `x` is the next element in `cnt`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `cnt` must now contain at least two elements, and `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` must contain at least two elements, `ans` is increased by `max(0, x - 1)` where `x` is the next element in `cnt`**
