Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `cnt` has at least one element.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is 0 + max(0, `x` - 1) + max(0, `x` - 1)
   - `cnt` must have at least one element

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `cnt` has at least one element, we need to ensure that `cnt` still has at least one element for the next iteration.
   - After the previous iteration, `cnt` had at least one element. For the loop to execute again, `cnt` must still have at least one element.
   - The variable `x` will be the first element of `cnt` in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.
   - `cnt` must still have at least one element for the next iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is 0 + max(0, `x` - 1) + max(0, `x` - 1), `cnt` must have at least one element** (Note: `x` will be the first element of `cnt` in the next iteration, but we don't need to specify its exact value since it's determined by the loop execution).

However, to clearly reflect the necessary conditions for the next iteration, we can rephrase it as:

State: **`ans` is 0 + max(0, `x` - 1) + max(0, `x` - 1), `cnt` must have at least one element, where `x` is the first element of `cnt`**.

But since the exact value of `x` is not specified and only the condition on `cnt` is needed, the final answer is:

State: **`ans` is 0 + max(0, `x` - 1) + max(0, `x` - 1), `cnt` must have at least one element**.
