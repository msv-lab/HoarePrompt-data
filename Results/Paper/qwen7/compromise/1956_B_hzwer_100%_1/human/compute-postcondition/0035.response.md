Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`.
   - Inside the loop, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` must have at least one element.
   - `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt[x]` being the original value of `cnt[x]` plus 1.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is an element from the list `a`, it will be different in each iteration.
   - The list `a` itself does not change within the loop, so it remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still have at least one element.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `x` will be set to the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`a` having at least one element) is maintained.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list `a`**
