Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is 0 + max(0, `x` - 1)
   - `cnt` must have at least one element

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in `cnt`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `cnt`, the variable `cnt` can change based on the loop execution.
   - The variable `x` changes with each iteration, but its exact value is not specified in the state at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The key point is that for the loop to execute again, `cnt` must still have at least one element.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is dependent on the value of `x`, which will be updated in the next iteration.
   - `cnt` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `cnt` must still have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 0 + max(0, `x` - 1), `cnt` must have at least one element**
