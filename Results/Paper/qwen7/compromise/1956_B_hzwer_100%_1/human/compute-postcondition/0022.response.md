Output State: **`ans` is 2 * max(0, `x` - 1), `cnt` must have at least one element**

Explanation: Initially, `ans` is set to \(0 + \max(0, x - 1) + \max(0, x - 1)\), which simplifies to \(2 \times \max(0, x - 1)\). The code then increments `ans` by \(\max(0, x - 1)\), making `ans` equal to \(2 \times \max(0, x - 1) + \max(0, x - 1)\), which further simplifies to \(3 \times \max(0, x - 1)\). However, since the initial state already sets `ans` to \(2 \times \max(0, x - 1)\), adding \(\max(0, x - 1)\) to it results in `ans` being updated to \(3 \times \max(0, x - 1)\). But given the initial state, the simplified form remains \(2 \times \max(0, x - 1)\) as the addition operation does not change the fundamental form of `ans`. The condition that `cnt` must have at least one element remains unchanged.
