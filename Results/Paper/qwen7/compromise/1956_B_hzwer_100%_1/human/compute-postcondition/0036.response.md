Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list `a`, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1**

This means that the dictionary `cnt` has its count for the key `x` (which is the next element in the list `a`) incremented by 1. The lists `a` and the value of `x` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the updated count for `x` in the dictionary `cnt` is reflected in the output state.
