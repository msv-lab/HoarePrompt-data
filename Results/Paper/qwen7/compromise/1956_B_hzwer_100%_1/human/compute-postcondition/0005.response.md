Output State: **`cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are initialized to 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the number of integers input from `sys.stdin.readline`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer from 1 through `n` appears at most 2 times, and `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `cnt` of length `n + 1` where all elements are set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or the `input` function. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
