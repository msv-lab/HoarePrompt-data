Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a:`. The objects involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` is the variable used to iterate over the elements of `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - On the first iteration, `x` will be the first element of `a`.
   - For subsequent iterations, `x` will take the next element in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is the current element being processed in each iteration, it will start as the first element of `a` and change with each iteration.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged within the loop; it is the same list that was provided before the loop started.

5. **Consider the initial state of `a`**:
   - Since `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, its exact contents are unknown until the user inputs the values.
   - However, we know that `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` must be a non-empty list (since the loop will execute at least once if `a` contains at least one element).
- `x` will be the first element of `a` during the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: `a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the first element of `a`**
