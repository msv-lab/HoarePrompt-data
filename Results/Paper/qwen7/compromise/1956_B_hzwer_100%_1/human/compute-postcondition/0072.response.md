Output State: `cnt` is [2], `ans` is 3.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the list `cnt` contains only one element, which is 2. This indicates that there was exactly one number in the list `a` that appeared exactly twice. The variable `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt` after all iterations, which totals to 3. This means that for every number in `a` that appeared more than once, `ans` incremented by the number of times it appeared minus one. Since the only remaining value in `cnt` is 2, it implies that there was one number that appeared twice, contributing 1 to `ans` (since `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1`). The loop stops because `cnt` now has only one element, and no further iterations are possible.
