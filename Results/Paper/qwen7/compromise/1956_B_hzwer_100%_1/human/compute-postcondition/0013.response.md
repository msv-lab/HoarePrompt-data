Output State: The list `cnt` will contain the count of each integer from the list `a`. After all iterations of the loop, every element in `cnt` (except for the element at index 0, which remains 0) will be equal to the number of times that corresponding integer appeared in the list `a`.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `cnt` list will hold the frequency count of each integer found in the list `a`. Specifically, `cnt[x]` will represent how many times the integer `x` appeared in `a`, for every integer `x` in `a` (from 1 to `n`). The first element of `cnt` (at index 0) will still be 0 since the loop does not increment it.
