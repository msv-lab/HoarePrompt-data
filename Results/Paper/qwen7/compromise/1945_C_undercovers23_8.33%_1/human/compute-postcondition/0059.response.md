Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `lst` will contain all indices `i+1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are 50 or more, `mini` will be the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `lst` will include all the indices `i+1` from the string `s` where the percentage of zeros (`zero_perc`) and ones (`one_perc`) are each 50% or more. Additionally, the variable `mini` will hold the smallest value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop, which is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and each `ele` in `lst`.
