Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `lst` must contain at least one element.
  - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

### Loop Head:
```
for ele in lst:
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst`.
   - The variable `ele` represents the current element being processed in the loop.
   - The variable `lst` is the list being iterated over.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `lst`.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `lst`, the number of elements in `lst` decreases by one with each iteration.
   - The variable `mini` is updated based on the current element `ele` during each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `lst` must contain at least one element.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still contain at least one element.
- The variable `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. Therefore, `mini` remains unchanged from the previous iteration unless the current element `ele` is processed.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `lst` must contain at least one element.
- `mini` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State:
State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**
