Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` and the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `elem` and `lst`**:
   - The variable `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - 5)`.
   - The variable `ele` is currently set to 5.
   - The variable `final` is an empty list.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `lst` must contain at least one element. If `lst` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `elem` will take on the values from the list `lst` during each iteration of the loop.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `lst` is not empty for the loop to execute. We don't need to adjust the values of `mini`, `ele`, or `final` since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`lst` must have at least one element**.
