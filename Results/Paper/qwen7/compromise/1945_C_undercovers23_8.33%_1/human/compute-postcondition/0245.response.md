Output State: **`c1` is 0, the final list is [n], and its length is 1**.

The code `final.append(n)` appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after appending `n`, `final` becomes `[n]` and its length changes to 1. The value of `c1` remains unchanged at 0.
