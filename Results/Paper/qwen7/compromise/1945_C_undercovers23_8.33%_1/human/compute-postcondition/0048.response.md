Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, if the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 3, otherwise `one` is 3, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 3, `lst` contains the elements 3 and 4, `one_perc` is 33**

Explanation: The code `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 3, `i + 1` equals 4. Therefore, the list `lst` now contains the elements 3 and 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
