Output State: **`final` is a list, `mini` remains unchanged, `pk` is `n // 2`, `s` is an input string**.

The code `pk = n // 2` assigns the value of `n // 2` (integer division of `n` by 2) to the variable `pk`. The other variables (`final`, `mini`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
