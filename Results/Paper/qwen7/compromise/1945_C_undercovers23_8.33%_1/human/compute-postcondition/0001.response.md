Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable mentioned here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given as an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute because `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will always execute based on the given constraints, we don't need to change the value of `t` itself. However, we need to ensure that the initial state of `t` is within the specified range.

Given the constraints, the initial state of `t` should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**.
