Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 0, and `lst` contains the value 3.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` equals 3. Therefore, `lst` now contains the value 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
