Output State: **`final` is a list with three elements, `pk` and `mini` are unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `lst`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` adds the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `final` initially had two elements, after appending `elem`, it now has three elements. The values of `pk` and `mini` remain unchanged, and `elem` is updated to the next element in `lst`.
