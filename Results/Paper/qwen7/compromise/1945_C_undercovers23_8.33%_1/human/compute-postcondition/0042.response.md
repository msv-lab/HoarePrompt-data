Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, if the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 3, otherwise `one` is 3, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 50, and `lst` contains the element 3**

Explanation: The variable `zero` is incremented by 1. Since `zero` was initially 2 (based on the condition given), it now becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
