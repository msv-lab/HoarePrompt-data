Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `elem`, `lst`, `pk`, and `mini`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `elem` in the list `lst`.

3. **Determine the postconditions**:
   - `lst` must have at least one element.
   - `pk` is unchanged.
   - `mini` is unchanged.
   - If `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, then `final` has an additional element `elem`.
   - Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` must have at least one element.
   - `pk` is unchanged.
   - `mini` is unchanged.
   - `final` may or may not have an additional element based on the condition.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `lst` is being iterated over, the next element `elem` will be taken from `lst`.
   - `pk` and `mini` remain unchanged.
   - `final` will either remain unchanged or have an additional element depending on the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

Given that the loop is about to start another iteration, the next element `elem` will be taken from `lst`. Therefore, `lst` must have at least two elements now (since it had at least one before and we are taking one out).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `lst` must have at least two elements, while `pk`, `mini`, and the condition for `final` remain the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`lst` must have at least two elements, `pk` is unchanged, `mini` is unchanged, and if `abs(pk - elem) == mini`, then `final` has an additional element `elem`. Otherwise, `final` remains unchanged.**
