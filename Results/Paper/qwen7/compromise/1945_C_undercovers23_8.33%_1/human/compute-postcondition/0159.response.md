Output State: **`mini` will be the minimum value between its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` remains 5. `final` is an empty list, and `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`, and `final` contains all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`, and `final` is sorted.**

The code `c1 = o * 100 // n` calculates the value of `c1` based on the values of `o` and `n`. However, since the initial values of `o` and `n` are not specified, `c1` is simply the integer division of `o * 100` by `n`. The other variables (`mini`, `ele`, `final`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
