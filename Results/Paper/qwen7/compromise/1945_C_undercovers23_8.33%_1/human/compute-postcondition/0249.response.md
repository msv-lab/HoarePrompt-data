Output State: **The final list `final` will contain a single element, which is either 0 or n, based on the overall distribution of '1's and '0's in the string `s` across all test cases. Specifically, if the percentage of '1's in the entire string `s` is 50% or more, the final list will be [0]. Otherwise, it will be [n].**

This output state is derived from the fact that after all iterations of the loop, the logic ensures that `final` will ultimately contain the most optimal position `ele` where the percentage of '0's and '1's in the substring up to that point is closest to 50%. Given the constraints and the nature of the loop, if the overall percentage of '1's in the concatenated string `s` across all test cases is 50% or more, the optimal position will be at the start (index 0), making the final list [0]. Conversely, if the percentage of '1's is less than 50%, the optimal position will be at the end (index `n`), making the final list [n].
