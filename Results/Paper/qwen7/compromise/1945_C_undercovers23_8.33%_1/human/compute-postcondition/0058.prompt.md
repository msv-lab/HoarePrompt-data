Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n-1`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, `n` remains the same, `zero` will be equal to the count of '0's in the string `s`, `one` will be equal to the count of '1's in the string `s`, `zero_perc` will be calculated based on the final value of `zero` and `i+1`, `one_perc` will be calculated based on the final value of `one` and `n-i-1`, and `lst` will contain all indices `i+1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are 50 or more.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
