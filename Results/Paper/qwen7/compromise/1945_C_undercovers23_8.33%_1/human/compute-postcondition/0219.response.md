Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the second element in `lst`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Here, `ele` is specified to be the second element in `lst`, and no other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, `mini` is updated accordingly, and `ele` remains as the second element in `lst`.
