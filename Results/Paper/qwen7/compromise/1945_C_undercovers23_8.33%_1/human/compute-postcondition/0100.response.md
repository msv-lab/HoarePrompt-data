Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `pk` is `n // 2`, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code sets `mini` to \(10^8\), which is 100000000. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
