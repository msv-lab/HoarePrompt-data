Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the percentage of residents satisfied on each side of the road. Specifically, the calculation of `zero_perc` and `one_perc` uses a percentage approach, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The problem requires counting the number of residents on each side and checking if at least \(\lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil\) residents are satisfied, not calculating a percentage.

For example, consider the input:

```
3
101
```

The program calculates the percentages as follows:
- For \(i = 0\): `zero_perc = 100%`, `one_perc = 0%`
- For \(i = 1\): `zero_perc = 50%`, `one_perc = 100%`

Since neither condition is met (both conditions require at least 50%), the program incorrectly does not append 2 to the list `lst`.

However, the correct approach would be to directly count the number of zeros and ones and check if they meet the required conditions. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            pk = n // 2
        else:
            pk = n // 2
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = pow(10, 8)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if math.ceil(zero * 1.0 / (i + 1)) >= 0.5 and math.ceil(one * 1.0 / (n - i - 1)) >= 0.5:
                lst.append(i + 1)
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
        final = []
        for elem in lst:
            if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
                final.append(elem)
        final.sort()
        if len(final) == 0:
            c1 = o * 1.0 / n
            if c1 >= 0.5:
                final.append(0)
            else:
                final.append(n)
        print(final[0])

func()
```

This corrected version directly counts the number of zeros and ones and checks if they meet the required conditions, ensuring the program works as expected.
