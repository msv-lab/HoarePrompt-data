Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `zero_perc` and `one_perc`:**
   - The percentages `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are calculated incorrectly. They should represent the proportion of zeros and ones that are satisfied on each side of the road, not the percentage of the total number of zeros or ones.
   - The formula `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` and `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))` should be replaced with `math.ceil(zero / (i + 1) * 2)` and `math.ceil(one / (n - i - 1) * 2)` respectively, since the condition requires at least \(\lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil\) residents to be satisfied.

2. **Handling of Ties:**
   - The code does not correctly handle ties when determining the optimal position `i`. It should ensure that the position with the smallest absolute difference from the middle (`\left|\frac{n}{2} - i\right|\)`) is chosen, and in case of a tie, the smaller index is selected.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when all residents prefer the same side of the road. For instance, if all residents prefer the left side (`"000..."`), the road should be placed before the first house, but the current logic might fail to recognize this.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            pk = n // 2
        else:
            pk = n // 2
        
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            
            zero_perc = math.ceil(zero / (i + 1) * 2)
            one_perc = math.ceil(one / (n - i - 1) * 2)
            
            if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
                lst.append(i + 1)
        
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
        
        final = []
        for elem in lst:
            if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
                final.append(elem)
        
        final.sort()
        if len(final) == 0:
            if z * 2 >= n:
                final.append(0)
            elif o * 2 >= n:
                final.append(n)
        
        print(final[0])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions are met and handles edge cases appropriately.
