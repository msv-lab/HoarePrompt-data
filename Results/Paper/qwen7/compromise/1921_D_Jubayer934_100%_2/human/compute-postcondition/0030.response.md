Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables `i` and `n`. Therefore, these are the only variables that can be adjusted.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `temp` is 0 (not -1)
   - `ans` contains the absolute differences as described
   - The current value of `temp` is not -1

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = temp` to `i < n`. Given that `temp` is 0, the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop condition is `i < n`, the loop will execute if `n > 0`.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Adjusted States**:
- `i` will be 1
- `n` must still be greater than 0, but since `i` has incremented, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
