Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `temp`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `temp` to `n-1` (inclusive). This means the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` has a new element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.
   - Other variables retain their original states.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, let's adjust the state:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
- `temp` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise, but since no such information is given, we assume `temp` stays the same.

Therefore, if `i` was `i_val` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_val + 1`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`ans` has a new element which is the absolute difference between `a[i_val + 1]` and `b[-(n - (i_val + 1))]`, and the other variables retain their original states.**

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume `i_val` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration. Then the state would be:

**`ans` has a new element which is the absolute difference between `a[3]` and `b[-(n - 3)]`, and the other variables retain their original states.**

In general form, the state can be expressed as:

**`ans` has a new element which is the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `b[-(n - (i + 1))]`, and the other variables retain their original states.**

Thus, the final answer is:

State: **`ans` has a new element which is the absolute difference between `a[i + 1]` and `b[-(n - (i + 1))]`, and the other variables retain their original states.**
