Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. It validates that t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers with n â‰¤ m and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Additionally, a_i and b_i are integers within the range of 1 to 10^9. The function returns results based on these inputs for each test case.**

Note: Since the actual logic of processing and returning the results is not specified in the problem statement, the description focuses on the constraints and expected inputs for the function.
