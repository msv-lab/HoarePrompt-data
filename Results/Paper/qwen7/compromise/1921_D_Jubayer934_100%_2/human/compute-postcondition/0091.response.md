Output State: **`i` is equal to `temp + 1`, `temp` is now equal to `i`, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `temp = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `temp + 1`) to `temp`. Therefore, `temp` is updated to be `temp + 1`, and `i` remains unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
