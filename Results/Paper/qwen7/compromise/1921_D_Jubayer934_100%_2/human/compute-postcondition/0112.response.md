Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `i` equals `n`. Given that the loop starts with `i` equal to `temp` (which is not specified but implied to be less than `n`), and considering the loop increments `i` without any decrement or change, the loop will append the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to `ans` for each iteration until `i` reaches `n`.

Since the loop executes 3 times as per the given states, we can infer that `temp` is likely 6 (since after 3 iterations, `i` is 6). Therefore, the loop will run from `i = 6` to `i = n-1`.

The final state of the loop will be when `i` is equal to `n`, meaning `ans` will contain the absolute differences for all indices from `temp` (6) to `n-1`.

Output State: `ans` is a list containing the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for indices ranging from `6` to `n-1`, `i` is equal to `n`, and the other variables (`a`, `b`, `temp`) retain their original states.
