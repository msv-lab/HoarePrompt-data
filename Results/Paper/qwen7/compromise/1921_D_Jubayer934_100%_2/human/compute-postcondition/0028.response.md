Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `n`, as well as `temp`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop starts from `i = temp` and runs until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `temp` must be less than or equal to `n - 1` because the loop condition is `i < n` and the loop starts from `temp`.

3. **Consider the Postcondition Given**:
   - The postcondition mentions that `i` should be equal to `n - 1` at some point during the loop execution. This means that `temp` should be set such that the loop can reach `i = n - 1`.
   - Since the loop starts from `temp` and runs up to `n - 1`, `temp` must be 0 or less (since `i` will increment and eventually reach `n - 1`).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will start from `temp` and increment until it reaches `n - 1`. Therefore, `temp` must be 0 for the loop to reach `i = n - 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - `temp` must be 0 for the loop to start correctly.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `temp` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is 0, `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element in `a` and `b` for indices where `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) <= abs(a[i] - b[i])`, and the current value of `temp` is not -1**.
