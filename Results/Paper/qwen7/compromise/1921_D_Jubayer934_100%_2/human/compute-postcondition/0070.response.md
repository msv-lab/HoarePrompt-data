Output State: **`ans` now contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `i + 2` is less than `n`, `temp` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i + 2` is still less than `n`, and `temp` is still less than `n`.
