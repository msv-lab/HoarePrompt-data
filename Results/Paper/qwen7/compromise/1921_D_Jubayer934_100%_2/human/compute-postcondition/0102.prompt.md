Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `i` equals `n`, `temp` equals `-1`, `b` is a list of the `m` largest integers from the input split and converted to integers, sorted in descending order, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a sorted list of the first `n` integers from the input split and converted to integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
        temp = i
        break
    ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is assigned the value of `temp`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list that has appended `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, and if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, no change is made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `temp + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` now contains `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, and if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, there is no change in the values of `i`, `temp`, `n`, and `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `temp + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` now contains the maximum absolute difference between elements of arrays `a` and `b` at indices `i-1` and `-(n - (i-1))`, respectively, `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
