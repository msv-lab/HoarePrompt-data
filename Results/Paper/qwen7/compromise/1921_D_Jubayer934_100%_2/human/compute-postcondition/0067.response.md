Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `temp`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `temp` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `temp` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **New state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously less than `n`, it will still be less than `n` in the next iteration.
   - `temp` remains the same.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`, `i` is less than `n`, `temp` is less than `n` and `i` is incremented by 1**.

Since we cannot directly modify `i` in the state, we express the condition for the next iteration:

State: **`ans` contains the absolute difference between `a[i+1]` and `b[-(n - (i + 1))]`, `i + 1` is less than `n`, `temp` is less than `n`**.
