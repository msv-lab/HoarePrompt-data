Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers. The absolute difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the element at index `-(n - i)` in list `b` is greater than the absolute difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the element at index `i` in list `b`.
