Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is assigned the value of `temp`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - `ans` is a list that has appended `abs(a[i] - b[i])`.
   - There is a condition where if the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, no change is made to the variables.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to `temp`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `temp + 1`.
   - The condition `n > 0` remains unchanged.
   - The lists `a` and `b` remain the same.
   - The list `ans` will have appended `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[temp + 1])` if the loop continues.

5. **Check the break condition**: The break condition involves comparing `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` and `abs(a[i] - b[i])`. Since `i` is incremented to `temp + 1`, we need to check if the break condition holds for `i = temp + 1`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `i` will be `temp + 1`.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `a` and `b` remain the same.
- `ans` will have appended `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[temp + 1])` if the loop continues.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is `temp + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list that has appended `abs(a[temp + 1] - b[temp + 1])` if the loop continues.**
