Output State: **`i` is `temp + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` now contains `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, and if `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, there is no change in the values of `i`, `temp`, `n`, and `ans`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated to include `abs(a[i] - b[i])`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
