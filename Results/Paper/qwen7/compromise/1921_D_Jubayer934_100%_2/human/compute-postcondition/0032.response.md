Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(temp, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[-(n-1)]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration because the problem does not specify any change to `n` within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 (unchanged).
   - The value of `ans` remains the same since it is not modified by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[-(n-1)]`**
