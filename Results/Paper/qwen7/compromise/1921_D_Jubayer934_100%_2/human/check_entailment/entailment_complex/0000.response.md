Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Array Initialization and Sorting**: 
   - The program initializes arrays `a` and `b` with the respective inputs and sorts them. This is done correctly for both arrays, ensuring that `a` is sorted in ascending order and `b` is sorted in descending order.

3. **Condition Check and Adjustment**:
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` (from the end of `b`) is greater than the absolute difference between the current element of `a` and the current element of `b`. If true, it updates the temporary variable `temp` and breaks out of the loop. This logic is intended to find the first point where swapping the elements would increase the total difference.
   - If `temp` is not `-1`, the program adjusts the remaining elements of `ans` by using the elements from the end of `b`.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the absolute differences stored in `ans` and prints it. This is the core logic for calculating the maximum difference `D`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `temp` might be `-1`, meaning no adjustment was needed, and directly prints the sum of `ans`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference `D` for each test case. The steps and conditions are logically sound and align with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
