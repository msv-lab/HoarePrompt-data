Output State: **Postcondition: `cx` is an empty set or contains all unique `x` values provided as inputs. `tmp` is the total count of `x` values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `cx` will contain all the unique `x` values that were provided as inputs. The variable `tmp` will hold the total count of these `x` values that satisfy the condition `i >= bx and i <= ax`. If no `x` values meet this condition, `tmp` will be 0. If `cx` is empty, it means no unique `x` values were provided, so both `cx` and `tmp` will remain their initial states.
