Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is -1, `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `n` is 0, and `r` now contains two elements where the second element is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `r`. Initially, `r` is `[0]`. After executing the code, `r` becomes `[0, 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously mentioned states.
