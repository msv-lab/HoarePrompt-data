Output State: **`t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values that were added during the loop's iterations, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, `a` and `x` are the last input integer values provided before the loop terminates.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
