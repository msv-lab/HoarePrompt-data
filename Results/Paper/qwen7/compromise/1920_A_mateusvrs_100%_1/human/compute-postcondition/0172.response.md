Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is a non-empty set containing all the unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is -1, `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `n` is 1, and `tmp` is 1.**

The variable `tmp` is incremented by 1, starting from an initial value of 0 (implied by the context). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
