Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000000)`, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `a` is a specific integer (either 1 or not 1), and `x` is a specific integer.**

Explanation: Since the if condition `a == 2` is not met (as `a` is either 1 or not 1), the else part of the if-else block is executed. Therefore, the postcondition of the else part is taken as the overall postcondition, which means `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000000)`, and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
