Output State: `t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is a non-empty set containing all the unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is -1, `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `n` is 1, and `tmp` is equal to the number of unique `x` values in the set `cx` that satisfy the condition `i >= bx and i <= ax`.

In this final output state, the variable `t` remains unchanged at 1, `r` stays as [0, 0], `cx` retains the set of all unique `x` values, `ax` is still the minimum of these `x` values, `bx` remains -1, `a` and `x` are the last input integers provided before the loop terminates, `n` is still 1, and `tmp` reflects the count of `x` values in `cx` that fall within the range defined by `bx` and `ax`.
