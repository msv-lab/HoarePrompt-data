Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in cx`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop condition checks if `i` is within the range defined by `bx` and `ax`. If `i` is in this range, `tmp` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i`: An integer.
   - `bx`: An integer representing the lower bound of the range.
   - `ax`: An integer representing the upper bound of the range.
   - `tmp`: An integer that is incremented if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `[bx, ax]` (inclusive).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `tmp` will be incremented by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

Given the conditions, let's assume the following values at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is some integer value, say `i_end`.
- `bx` is some integer value, say `bx_val`.
- `ax` is some integer value, say `ax_val`.
- `tmp` is an integer value, say `tmp_end`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `[bx, ax]` after it is incremented by 1. Therefore, `i_end + 1` must be within the range `[bx_val, ax_val]`.

If `i_end + 1` is within the range, `tmp` will be incremented by 1. If not, `tmp` will remain unchanged.

### Example Adjustment:
Assume the following values at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i_end = 5`
- `bx_val = 3`
- `ax_val = 8`
- `tmp_end = 2`

Since `i_end + 1 = 6` is within the range `[3, 8]`, `tmp` will be incremented by 1.

### Final State:
- `i` is now `6`.
- `tmp` is now `3`.

### State:
State: **`i` is 6, `bx` is 3, `ax` is 8, `tmp` is 3**
