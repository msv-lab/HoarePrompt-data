Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `ax`, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` equals 1, `bx` remains -1. Otherwise, `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and -1.**
