Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [ax - bx + 1 - tmp], `cx` retains the set of all unique `x` values, `ax` is still the minimum of these `x` values, `bx` remains -1, `a` and `x` are the last input integers provided before the loop terminates, `n` is still 1, and `tmp` reflects the count of `x` values in `cx` that fall within the range defined by `bx` and `ax`.**

Explanation: The code `r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)` appends the value of `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`. Since `bx` is -1, the expression simplifies to `ax + 1 - tmp`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
