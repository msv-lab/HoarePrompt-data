Postcondition: `t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0]. Depending on the value of `a`, `cx` is either a set containing `x` or an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, and `bx` is -1. If `a` equals 1, `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. Otherwise, `cx` remains a set containing `x`.
