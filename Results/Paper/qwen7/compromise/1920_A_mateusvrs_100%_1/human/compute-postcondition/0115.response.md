Output State: **`r` now contains the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `cx` is an empty set or contains all unique `x` values provided as inputs, `tmp` is the total count of `x` values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the list `r`. The values of `cx` and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `cx` is still an empty set or contains all unique `x` values provided as inputs, and `tmp` retains its initial value as the total count of `x` values in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.
