Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is 2 if `a` is 2, otherwise `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was initially an empty set (or a set containing `x`), after adding `x`, `cx` now contains `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
