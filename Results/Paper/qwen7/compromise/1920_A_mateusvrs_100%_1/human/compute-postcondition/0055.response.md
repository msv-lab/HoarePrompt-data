Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is a list containing 0, `n` must be 0, `cx` is a set containing all `x` values that were added during the loop's iterations, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, and `a` and `x` are the last input integer values provided before the loop terminates. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, then `bx` is greater than `ax`. Otherwise, `i` is 7, `bx` is 3, `ax` is 8, `tmp` is 5, and `r` is a list containing the value 2.**
