Postcondition: `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value. If `i` is a value such that `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is set to 1. Since there is no else part, the value of `tmp` remains unchanged if the condition `i >= bx and i <= ax` is not met.
