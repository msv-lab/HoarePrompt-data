Output State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value, `i` is a value such that `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `tmp` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other integer). Since no initial value for `tmp` is given, we assume it starts at 0. After executing `tmp += 1`, `tmp` becomes 1. All other variables (`cx` and `i`) remain unchanged.
