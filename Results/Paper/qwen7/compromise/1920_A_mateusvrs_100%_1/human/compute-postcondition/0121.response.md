Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is -1, `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `bx = -1` simply assigns the value `-1` to the variable `bx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
