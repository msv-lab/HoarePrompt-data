Output State: **`t` is 1, `r` is [0, 0], `cx` is a set containing all the unique `x` values provided as inputs, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values provided as inputs, `bx` is -1, `a` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `x` is the last input integer value provided before the loop terminates, `n` is 0, and `tmp` is 0.**

The code initializes `tmp` to 0. Since `tmp` was not previously defined, it is now assigned the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
