Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes a dictionary named `cnt`. This dictionary is empty, and all other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, and `a`) retain their initial states.
