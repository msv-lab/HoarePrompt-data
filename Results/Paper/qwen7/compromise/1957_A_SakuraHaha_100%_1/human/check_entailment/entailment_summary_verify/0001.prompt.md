You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (number of stick lengths) and a list of integers representing stick lengths. It calculates and prints the total number of groups of three identical stick lengths that can be formed from the given stick lengths.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of regular polygons (equilateral triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.) that can be formed using the given sticks.
   - Each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick, and no stick can be used more than once.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` but does not process them correctly. It should loop over all test cases, but it only processes the first test case.
   - Inside the loop, the function `func_1()` is called, which is supposed to handle the logic for each test case.
   - In `func_1()`, the program correctly counts the occurrences of each stick length and then calculates how many complete polygons can be formed using these counts.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - For each stick length, it calculates how many complete polygons can be formed by dividing the count by 3 (since each polygon needs at least 3 sides).
   - This logic is correct for forming equilateral triangles, but it doesn't account for other polygons like squares, pentagons, etc., which require different numbers of sides.

4. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the first test case (`1 1`), the program correctly outputs `0` because there's only one stick and it's not enough to form any polygon.
   - For the second test case (`1 1`), the program also correctly outputs `0`.
   - For the third test case (`2 2 3 3 3 3`), the program correctly outputs `1` because four sticks of length 3 can form one square.
   - For the fourth test case (`4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`), the program incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `2`. It should be able to form one pentagon with side length 2 and one square with side length 4.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is incorrect because it only considers triangles (dividing by 3) and does not generalize to other polygons. Additionally, it only processes the first test case instead of all test cases.
