### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the examples.

1. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1()` processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (number of stick lengths) and a list of integers representing stick lengths.
   - It calculates and prints the total number of groups of three identical stick lengths that can be formed from the given stick lengths.
   - This summary suggests that the function only considers groups of three identical stick lengths, which is a simplification of the problem.

2. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths.
   - It uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It then iterates over the values in the dictionary and adds the integer division of each value by 3 to the answer `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the answer for each test case.

3. **Problem Description and Examples:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed simultaneously, where each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick and no stick is reused.
   - The examples show that the program correctly handles cases where the number of sticks can form multiple polygons with different numbers of sides.

4. **Evaluation Based on Function Summary:**
   - The function summary states that the function only counts the number of sides for triangles (since it divides the count by 3).
   - However, the program actually counts the number of groups of three identical stick lengths, which can be used to form triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.
   - The program dynamically checks for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides based on the counts of each stick length.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the examples provided in the problem description.
   - For the fourth test case, the program outputs 2, which is correct because it can form one pentagon (with side length 2) and one square (with side length 4).

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed simultaneously. It dynamically checks for the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides based on the counts of each stick length.

**Final: True**
