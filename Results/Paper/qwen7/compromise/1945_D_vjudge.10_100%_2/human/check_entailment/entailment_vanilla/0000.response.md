Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions.
   - It initializes `pergunta` to infinity (`float('inf')`) and a variable `x` to 0.
   - It iterates through the list `a` from the last element to the first.
   - For each element `i`:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
     - It adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `pergunta`.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's consider the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem statement:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pergunta` is initialized to infinity, which is correct because we need to find the minimum cost.
   - `x` is initialized to 0, representing the accumulated cost.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `i` is within the first `m` positions.
   - If `i` is within the first `m` positions, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
   - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation seems correct. When moving to a position `i`, the cost is the sum of the cost to move from `j` to `i` (where `j < i`), which is stored in `x`, plus the cost to move from `j` to `i` itself (`a[i]`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `i` might be out of bounds for `m` correctly by only updating `pergunta` when `i < m`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic is correct and aligns with the problem statement. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
