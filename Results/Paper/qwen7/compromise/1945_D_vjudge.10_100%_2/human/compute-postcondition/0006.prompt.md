You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is a string, a and b are lists of non-negative integers with length n, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000, and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: Output State: pergunta is the minimum value of (x + a[i]) for all i where 0 ≤ i < m, and x is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of (a[i] and b[i]) for all i where 0 ≤ i < n.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value of (cumulative sum of min(a[i] and b[i]) for 0 ≤ i < n) + a[i] for 0 ≤ i < m))
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter pergunta (a string), two parameters a and b (both are lists of non-negative integers with length n), and two parameters n and m (positive integers where 1 <= m <= n). The function returns a value based on specific conditions involving the lists a and b and the integers n and m.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
