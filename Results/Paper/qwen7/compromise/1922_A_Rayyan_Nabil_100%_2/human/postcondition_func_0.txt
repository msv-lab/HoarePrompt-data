The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (with 1 <= n <= 20), and two strings `a` and `b` each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, along with another string `c` of the same length. It checks if there is at least one index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index exists, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition checked.
