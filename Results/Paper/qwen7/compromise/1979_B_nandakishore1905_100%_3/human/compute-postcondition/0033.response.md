Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, then `k & (k - 1)` equals 0. Otherwise, `k` is neither a power of 2, `k` is either odd or even, `f` is 0, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, and `q` is 2.
