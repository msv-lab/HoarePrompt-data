Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is |n - m|, `f` is k - \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is not a power of 2, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).**

Explanation: The code `q = 2 ** (p - 1)` simply updates the value of `q` to be \(2^{(p - 1)}\), where `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
