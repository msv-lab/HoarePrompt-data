Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`
   - `f` is 0
   - `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix
   - `p` is the length of `l`
   - `q` is 2
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Given this, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `f` is 0, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2**
