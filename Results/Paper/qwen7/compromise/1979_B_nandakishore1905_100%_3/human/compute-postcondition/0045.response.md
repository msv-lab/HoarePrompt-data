Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must not be a power of 2, `f` is defined as \(k - 2^{p - 1}\), `l` is a binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code converts the value of `f` (which is \(k - 2^{p - 1}\)) into its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. The values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `f` remain unchanged, but `l` now holds the binary string representation of `f`.
