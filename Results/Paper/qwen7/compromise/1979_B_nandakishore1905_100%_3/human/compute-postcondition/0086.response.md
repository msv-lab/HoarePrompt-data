Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is \(|n - m|\), `f` is now \(k - 2^p - 2^{(p - 1)}\) and `f` must not be a power of 2, `l` is a binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `p = len(l)` calculates the length of the binary string representation of `f` (without the '0b' prefix) and assigns it to `p`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `f`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
