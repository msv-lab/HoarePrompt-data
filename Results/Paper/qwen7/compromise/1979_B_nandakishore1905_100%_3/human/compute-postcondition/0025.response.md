Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `k` is not a power of 2, `k` is even, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `f` is the even number that is not a power of 2 and its binary string representation without the '0b' prefix is reassigned to `l`, `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is now the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `f` into its binary string representation, removes the '0b' prefix, and assigns the result back to `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
