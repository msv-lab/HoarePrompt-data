Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is not a power of 2, and `k` is even, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `f` is \(k - 2^{(p-1)} - 2^{(p-1)}\)**.

Explanation: The value of `f` is updated by subtracting `q` from `f`. Since `q` is equal to \(2^{(p-1)}\), the new value of `f` becomes \(k - 2^{(p-1)} - 2^{(p-1)}\). All other variables remain unchanged.
