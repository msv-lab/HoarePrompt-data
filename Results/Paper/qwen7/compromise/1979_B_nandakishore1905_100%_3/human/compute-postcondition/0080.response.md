Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is \(|n - m|\), `f` is now \(k - 2^p\) and must not be a power of 2, `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\)**.

Explanation: The line `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` updates the variable `l` to be the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `f` is \(k - 2^p\), and `l` is the binary string of this value. The length of `l` is stored in `p`, and `q` remains as \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
