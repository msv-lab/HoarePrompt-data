Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is not a power of 2, and `k` is even, `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p-1)}\), `f` is \(k - q\), `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `p = len(l)` calculates the length of the string `l`, which is the binary representation of `f` (where `f` is `k - q`). This length is stored in `p`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
