Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is |n - m|, `f` is k - \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is not a power of 2, `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code `p = len(l)` calculates the length of the binary string representation of `k` (stored in `l`) and assigns it to `p`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
