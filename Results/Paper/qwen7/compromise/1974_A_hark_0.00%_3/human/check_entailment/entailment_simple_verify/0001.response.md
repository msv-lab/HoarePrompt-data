### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the given program is incorrect due to potential flaws in the logic for calculating the minimum number of screens needed. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to verify this conclusion.

#### Function `func_1`
- This function returns the smaller of the two values `a` and `b`. However, it is not used anywhere in the program, so it is indeed irrelevant to the main functionality.

#### Function `func_2`
- This function is responsible for calculating the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`

1. **Input Parsing**
   ```python
   (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
   ```
   - Correctly parses the input for `x` and `y`.

2. **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are positive**
   ```python
   if x > 0 and y > 0:
       bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
       x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
       bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
       print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
   ```
   - `bxsfory` calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into half of the available 1x1 slots.
   - `x` is adjusted by subtracting the space taken by these 2x2 icons and adding the space they save (since each 2x2 icon saves 11 1x1 slots).
   - `bxsfory1` calculates the number of remaining 1x1 slots that need to be placed on additional screens.
   - The result is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

3. **Case 2: Only `x` is positive**
   ```python
   elif x == 0 and y > 0:
       print(math.ceil(y / 2))
   ```
   - Simply prints the number of 2x2 icons needed, which is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

4. **Case 3: Only `y` is positive**
   ```python
   elif x > 0 and y == 0:
       print(math.ceil(x / 15))
   ```
   - Simply prints the number of 1x1 icons needed, which is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

5. **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are zero**
   ```python
   else:
       print(0)
   ```
   - Prints `0` if both `x` and `y` are zero.

#### Edge Cases and Correctness

1. **Handling `x` and `y` together**:
   - The adjustment `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` might not always be correct. For example, if `y` is large enough to fill up the remaining 1x1 slots after placing some 2x2 icons, the calculation might be off.
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens needs to ensure that the total number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons fits within the constraints of the grid.

2. **General Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens seems overly complex and might not cover all edge cases properly. For instance, it does not account for the possibility of partially filling a screen with 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons.

To validate the correctness, let's consider a few test cases and manually check the results.

#### Test Case Analysis

1. **Test Case: 1 1**
   - `x = 1`, `y = 1`
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(1 / 2) = 1`
   - `x = 1 - 1 * 15 + 1 * 4 = -11` (invalid, should be 0)
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(-11 / 15) + 1 = 0`
   - Result: `1 + 0 = 1` (correct)

2. **Test Case: 7 2**
   - `x = 7`, `y = 2`
   - `bxsfory = math.ceil(2 / 2) = 1`
   - `x = 7 - 1 * 15 + 2 * 4 = -1` (invalid, should be 0)
   - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(-1 / 15) + 1 = 0`
   - Result: `1 + 0 = 1` (incorrect, should be 2)

From the above analysis, we can see that the logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly handle the edge cases. The program does not accurately calculate the minimum number of screens needed.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the program, it is clear that the logic in `func_2` is incorrect and does not handle all edge cases properly. Therefore, the given program is indeed incorrect.

**Final: False**
