Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`, which is not used in the main logic of the program. It is not directly relevant to the problem at hand.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the icons. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the remaining space after placing some 1x1 icons. This is done by adjusting `x` and recalculating the number of screens needed.
   - If only `y` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
   - If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, calling `func_2` for each case. The logic in `func_2` seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic in `func_2` appears to be correct. The function correctly handles different scenarios and calculates the minimum number of screens needed based on the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

Therefore, the program as provided is correct.

Correctness: **True**
