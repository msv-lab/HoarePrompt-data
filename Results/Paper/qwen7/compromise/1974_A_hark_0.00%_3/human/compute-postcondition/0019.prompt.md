You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: 1 + bxsfory
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is an input integer greater than 0)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a positive integer greater than 0)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, then `x` remains unchanged and `y` remains 0. Otherwise, either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is greater than 0, and both `x` and `y` remain their original values.
        #State: `x` and `y` are integers. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, then `x` remains 0 and `y` remains greater than 0. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain their original values.
    #State: Postcondition: `x` and `y` are integers. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is greater than 0, then `x` is adjusted to be an input integer greater than 0 minus `bxsfory` times 15 plus `y` times 4, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2, and `bxsfory1` is 1 if `x` is greater than 0, otherwise 0. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, then `x` remains 0 and `y` remains greater than 0. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain their original values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns the total number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
