Postcondition: `x` and `y` are integers. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is greater than 0, then `x` is adjusted to be an input integer greater than 0 minus `bxsfory` times 15 plus `y` times 4, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2, and `bxsfory1` is 1 if `x` is greater than 0, otherwise 0. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, then `x` remains 0 and `y` remains greater than 0. Otherwise, `x` and `y` remain their original values.
