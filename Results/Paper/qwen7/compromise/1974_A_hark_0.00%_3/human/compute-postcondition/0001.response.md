State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not require adjustment.
2. The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because if `t` is 0, the loop will not run at all.
4. The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, so `t` must fall within this range.
5. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.
