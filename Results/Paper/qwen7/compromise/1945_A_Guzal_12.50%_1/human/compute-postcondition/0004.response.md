Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c. The function returns the result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function does not take any parameters itself but works on a set of test cases, each containing three integers (a, b, and c), and returns a result for each test case based on the specified conditions.
