Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, `t` retains its initial condition of being a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.
