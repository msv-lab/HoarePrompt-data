The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \). Based on the values of \( n \) and \( m \), it determines whether to output "Yes" or "No". Specifically, it outputs "Yes" if \( n \) equals \( m \), if \( m \) is one less than \( n \), if both \( n \) and \( m \) are even, or if both \( n \) and \( m \) are odd. Otherwise, it outputs "No". The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
