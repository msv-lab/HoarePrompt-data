Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a test case where t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers within the range 1 to 100. The function does not return any specific value but seems to perform some operations based on these inputs.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes multiple test cases involving integers t, n, and m, but without further details on the operations, the exact return value cannot be specified.
