### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program, including the fact that the function `func_1()` was not being called in the main loop and the logic for determining the minimum number of invitations was flawed. The corrected program addresses these issues as follows:

1. **Calling `func_1()` in the Main Loop**:
   - The original program did not call `func_1()` inside the loop that iterates over the test cases. By adding `func_1()` inside the loop, we ensure that each test case is processed correctly.

2. **Correct Logic for Determining Minimum Invitations**:
   - The original logic assumed that if no pair of friends are each other's best friends, 3 invitations are always needed. This is incorrect because we can still find a solution with fewer than 3 invitations in some cases. The corrected logic checks for the existence of a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair is found. If no such pair exists, it prints `3`.

Given these corrections, the program now accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and ensures that the minimum number of invitations is printed.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: True**

The corrected program is now correct according to the problem description.
