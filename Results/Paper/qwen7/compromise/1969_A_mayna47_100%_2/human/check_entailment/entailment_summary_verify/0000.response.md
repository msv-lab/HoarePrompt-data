### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary against the problem description and the given example.

1. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1()` processes a single test case.
   - It constructs a list `v` based on the input.
   - It checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`.
   - If such an index is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately.
   - Otherwise, it prints `3`.

2. **Problem Description and Example Analysis:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - Friends `i` and `p_i` will come to the party if both receive invitations.
   - For the example input:
     ```
     3
     5
     3 1 2 5 4
     4
     2 3 4 1
     2
     2 1
     ```
   - The expected outputs are:
     ```
     2
     3
     2
     ```

3. **Program Evaluation:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`v[v[i]] == i`). In such cases, it prints `2`, which is correct.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where no such pairs exist. According to the problem, in such cases, the minimum number of invitations needed is `3`.

4. **Example Input Analysis:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     2
     2 1
     ```
   - Here, friends 1 and 2 are each other's best friends. The program correctly prints `2` because inviting both friends ensures they both come to the party.
   - Now, consider another input:
     ```
     4
     2 3 4 1
     ```
   - In this case, there are no pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. The program should print `3` because inviting any three friends will ensure at least two come to the party. However, the program prints `3` as well, which is correct according to the problem statement.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where no such pairs exist and prints `3` as required.

Given the analysis, the original assessment was incorrect because the program does handle the case where no such pairs exist correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
