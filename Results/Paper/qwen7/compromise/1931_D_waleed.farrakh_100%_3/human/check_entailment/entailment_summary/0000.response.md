Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input from standard input and processes it correctly.
   - It handles the input format as specified in the problem statement.
   - It calls `func_1` to process each test case and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The execution summary indicates that `func_1` should calculate the number of beautiful pairs in the array.
   - However, the provided code for `func_1` does not perform any iterations or calculations as suggested by the return postconditions. This suggests that there might be an issue with the implementation of `func_1`.

Given the problem description and the execution summary:
- `func_2` is correctly implemented and handles the input and output as required.
- `func_1` is supposed to calculate the number of beautiful pairs but does not seem to do so based on the provided code.

Since `func_1` is not performing the necessary calculations, the overall program will not produce the correct results. Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect because `func_1` does not fulfill its intended purpose.

Correctness: **False**
