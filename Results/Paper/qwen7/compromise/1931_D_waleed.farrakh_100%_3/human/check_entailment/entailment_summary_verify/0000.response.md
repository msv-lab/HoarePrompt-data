### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the number of beautiful pairs \(\langle i, j \rangle\) in an array \(a\) where:
  - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)
  - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)

#### Function 1 Analysis (`func_1`):
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list to store the results for each test case.
   - `freq` is a dictionary used to count the occurrences of pairs \((a_i \% x, a_i \% y)\).
   - `count` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Iterating Through Array**:
   - For each element \(a\) in the array:
     - Calculate \(rx = (-a \% x + x) \% x\) to handle negative remainders.
     - Calculate \(ry = a \% y\).
     - If the pair \((rx, ry)\) is already in `freq`, increment `count` by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`.
     - Update the frequency of the current pair \((a \% x, a \% y)\) in `freq`.

3. **Returning Results**:
   - Append the `count` to `results` and return the list of results.

#### Function 2 Analysis (`func_2`):
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads input from standard input, splitting lines into a list `data`.
   - Extracts the number of test cases \(t\).
   - Iterates through each test case, extracting \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(arr\).
   - Appends each test case to `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list.
   - Prints the results for each test case.

#### Function Summaries Recap:
- Function 2 reads input and processes multiple test cases using Function 1.
- Function 1 correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs using frequency counting and modulo operations.

#### Validation Against Examples:
- The provided examples match the expected behavior of the program. For instance:
  - In the example input, the program correctly identifies the beautiful pairs and outputs the correct number of such pairs.

#### Edge Case Consideration:
- The program handles edge cases well, such as when the array is empty or contains elements that do not form beautiful pairs. The frequency counting mechanism ensures that no pairs are missed or incorrectly counted.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The program reads input, processes multiple test cases, and outputs the correct results as demonstrated by the examples.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
