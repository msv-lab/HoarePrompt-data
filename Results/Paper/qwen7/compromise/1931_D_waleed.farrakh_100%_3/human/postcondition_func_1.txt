The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer \( t \), followed by \( t \) sets of three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( arr \). It then processes these test cases using another function `func_1`, collects the results, and prints them. The function effectively transforms raw input data into processed output data by handling up to 5 test cases.
