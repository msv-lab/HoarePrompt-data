Postcondition: `count` is incremented by 1 if `(rx, ry)` (which is `(a % x, a % y)`) is already in `freq`, otherwise `count` is set to 1. `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third elements of the new first tuple in `test_cases` respectively. `arr` is a list with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary where the key `(a % x, a % y)` is set to either `freq[rx, ry] + 1` or 1, and `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `ry` is `a % y`.
