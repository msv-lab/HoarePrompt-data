Output State: `results` is a list containing the value of `count` for each iteration of the loop, `arr` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` encountered during all iterations of the loop, `count` is the total sum of frequencies of pairs `(rx, ry)` where `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y` for each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third elements of the last tuple in `test_cases`, respectively.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `results` will contain one value per input case from `test_cases`, representing the count calculated for each case. The `arr` list will be empty since it is reset at the start of each iteration. The `freq` dictionary will hold the frequency of all unique `(a % x, a % y)` pairs seen across all inputs. The `count` variable will hold the sum of counts for each unique `(rx, ry)` pair found in `freq`.
