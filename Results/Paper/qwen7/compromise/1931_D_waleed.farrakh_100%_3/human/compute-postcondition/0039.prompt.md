Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that is not empty, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for a in arr:
    rx = (-a % x + x) % x
    ry = a % y
    if (rx, ry) in freq:
        count += freq[rx, ry]
    current_pair = a % x, a % y
    if current_pair in freq:
        freq[current_pair] += 1
    else:
        freq[current_pair] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that is not empty, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `current_pair` is `a % x, a % y`, `count` is 0, `rx` is `(-n % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `arr[0] % y`, and if `current_pair` is already in `freq`, its count is incremented by 1; otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with a count of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that is not empty, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the remaining elements of the fourth element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `freq` is a dictionary, `current_pair` is `a % x, a % y`, `count` is updated by adding the value of `freq[rx, ry]` to its current value if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged, `rx` is `(-n % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `a` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `freq` is updated to have the key `current_pair` set to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that is not empty, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the remaining elements of the fourth element of the first tuple in `test_cases` after removing the first element, `freq` is a dictionary, `current_pair` is updated to `(a % x, a % y)`, `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]` if `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, otherwise `count` remains unchanged, where `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y`. If `current_pair` is already in `freq`, its count is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `current_pair` is added to `freq` with a count of 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
