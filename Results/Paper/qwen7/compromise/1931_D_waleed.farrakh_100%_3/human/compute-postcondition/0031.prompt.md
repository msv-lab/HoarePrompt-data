You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. arr is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: Output State: `test_cases` is a list containing five tuples \[(n, x, y, arr)\], `idx` is `idx + 10`, `t` is `t - 3`, where each tuple contains integers \(n\), \(x\), and \(y\) followed by a list of integers `arr` converted from `data[idx + 1].split()`. The loop has executed all its iterations, and `t` has been decremented by the total number of iterations, which is 5 in this case.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed 5 times since there are 5 tuples in `test_cases`. The `results` list will be fully iterated, and `result` will be the last element in the `results` list after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, it accepts three integers n, x, and y, where n ranges from 2 to 2·10^5 and x and y range from 1 to 10^9. Additionally, it accepts a list arr consisting of n integers, each ranging from 1 to 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the specified conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
