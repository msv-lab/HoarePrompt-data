Output State: **`n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases` and must contain at least one element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `rx` is (-`a` % `x` + `x`) % `x`**.

In this case, the code calculates the value of `rx` using the formula `(-a % x + x) % x`. However, since `a` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `rx`. But we know that `rx` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `x`, and the modulo operation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
