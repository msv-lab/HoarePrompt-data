Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing two tuples [(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr)], `idx` is `idx + 4`, `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers converted from `data[idx + 1].split()`**

Explanation: The initial state has `idx` set to `idx + 2`. After executing `idx += 2`, `idx` is updated to its current value plus 2. Therefore, `idx` becomes `idx + 4`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `t`, and `arr`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
