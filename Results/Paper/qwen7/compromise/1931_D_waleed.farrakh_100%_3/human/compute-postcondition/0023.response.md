Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`.
   - `test_cases` is a list containing five tuples \[(n, x, y, arr)\].
   - `idx` is `idx + 10`.
   - `t` is `t - 3`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `results`. Therefore, `results` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`, we need to ensure that `func_1(test_cases)` returns a non-empty list.
   - The variables `idx` and `t` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution but are modified outside the loop. They do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `results` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` must contain at least one element**
