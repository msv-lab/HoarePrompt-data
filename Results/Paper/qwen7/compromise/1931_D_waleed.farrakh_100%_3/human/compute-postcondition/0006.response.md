Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())` takes a string from `data[idx]` (where `idx` is an index), splits it into substrings, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns these integers to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. Since `test_cases` is an empty list before the execution, it remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are now integers derived from the split and mapped operation on `data[idx]`.
