Output State: **`arr` contains all elements from `test_cases`, `freq` is a dictionary mapping pairs `(a % x, a % y)` to their frequencies, `current_pair` is the last unique pair processed in `arr`, `count` is the sum of the values associated with the pairs `(rx, ry)` in `freq`, plus 1 for each unique pair encountered during the loop, `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third elements of the last tuple in `test_cases`, respectively, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.**

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The `arr` list contains all elements from the `test_cases` list, and the `freq` dictionary keeps track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` encountered. The `count` variable accumulates the total occurrences of these pairs, including the frequency of unique pairs. The `n`, `x`, and `y` variables retain the values of the first, second, and third elements of the last tuple in `test_cases`. The `results` list contains the final value of `count`.
