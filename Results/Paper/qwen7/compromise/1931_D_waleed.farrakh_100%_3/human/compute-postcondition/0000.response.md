Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `input` is now a string containing multiple space-separated integers representing the inputs for the test cases.**

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` replaces the built-in `input()` function with `sys.stdin.read()`. This means that instead of reading input from the standard input line by line, it reads the entire input as a single string. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are not directly modified by this line of code, but the way these values are read from the input changes. Therefore, the output state reflects this change in the input handling method while keeping the initial constraints on `t` intact.
