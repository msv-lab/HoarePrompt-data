Output State: **`test_cases` is a list containing two tuples [(n, x, y, arr), (n, x, y, arr)], `idx` is `idx + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers converted from `data[idx + 1].split()`**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list. Since `test_cases` initially contained one tuple, after appending, it now contains two tuples. The values of `idx` and `t` are updated as specified, and `arr` remains unchanged but is still a list of integers converted from `data[idx + 1].split()`.
