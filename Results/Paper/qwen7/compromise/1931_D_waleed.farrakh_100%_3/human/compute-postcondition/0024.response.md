Based on the initial state provided, `results` is a list that contains at least one element. Since no specific value or further details about the elements in the `results` list are given, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure and content of the list.

The print statement `print(result)` will print the first element of the `results` list because the variable `result` is not specified to refer to any other part of the list. Without loss of generality, if we denote the first element of the `results` list as `result[0]`, then the print statement will output this element.

Output: **result[0]**
