Output State: **`t` is the first integer from the list `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings, each string containing space-separated integers.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[0])` assigns the first element of the list `data`, which is expected to be a string of space-separated integers, converted to an integer, to the variable `t`. The rest of the list `data` remains unchanged.
