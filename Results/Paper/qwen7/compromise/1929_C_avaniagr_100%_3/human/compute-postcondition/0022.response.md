Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`, `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`, `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`, and `x` is equal to `k - 1`. Additionally, if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, then `a` remains unchanged; otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
