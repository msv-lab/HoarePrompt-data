Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the next line `s`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
