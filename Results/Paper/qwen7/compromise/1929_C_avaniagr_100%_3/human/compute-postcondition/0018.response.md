Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`.
- `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`.
- `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`.
- `x` is equal to `k - 1`.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
