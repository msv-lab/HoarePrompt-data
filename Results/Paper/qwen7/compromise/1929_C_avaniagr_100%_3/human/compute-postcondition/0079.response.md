Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the next line `s`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`, and `z` is `k - 1` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to either `x - k + 3` or `x - k + 2` depending on whether `a >= z` is true or false.**

This postcondition remains the same because both the if and else parts describe the same initial state and do not change the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `z`. The if and else parts simply restate the same conditions without altering the variables involved.
