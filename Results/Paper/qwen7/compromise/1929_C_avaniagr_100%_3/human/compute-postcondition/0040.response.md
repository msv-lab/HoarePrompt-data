Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`, `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`, `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`. If `x` equals `k - 1`, then `a` is either greater than or equal to `x + 2` or less than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, `z` is equal to \(2^n \times (k - 1) + n\), where `n` is the number of times the loop has executed, and `i` is `i + 1`. Additionally, `a` remains unchanged in both cases.
