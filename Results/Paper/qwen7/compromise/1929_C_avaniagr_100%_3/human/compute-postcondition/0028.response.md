Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`, `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`, `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`, `z` is equal to `2 * (k - 1)`**.

Explanation: Initially, `z` is set to `k - 2`. The code updates `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since `z` is initially `k - 2`, `z // (k - 1)` is 0 (because `k - 2` is less than `k - 1`). Thus, `z += 0 + 1` results in `z` becoming `k - 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `k - 1`. However, since `z` was initially `k - 2`, after the operation, `z` becomes `2 * (k - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
