Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is set to the integer value of the first space-separated token from `s`, `x` is set to the integer value of the second space-separated token from `s`, `a` is set to the integer value of the third space-separated token from `s`, `z` is equal to \(4 \times (k - 1) + 1\), `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `z` is calculated as \(2 \times (k - 1) + (2 \times (k - 1)) // (k - 1) + 1\). This simplifies to \(2 \times (k - 1) + 2 + 1 = 4 \times (k - 1) + 1\).
- The code then updates `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since `z = 4 \times (k - 1) + 1`, `z // (k - 1)` is `4 \times (k - 1)`, and thus `z // (k - 1) + 1` is `4 \times (k - 1) + 1`. Adding this to `z` results in `4 \times (k - 1) + 1 + 4 \times (k - 1) + 1 = 8 \times (k - 1) + 2`.
- However, since `z` was already `4 \times (k - 1) + 1`, the new value of `z` remains `8 \times (k - 1) + 2`, which simplifies back to `4 \times (k - 1) + 1` due to the nature of integer division and addition.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so it is represented as `i + 1`.
