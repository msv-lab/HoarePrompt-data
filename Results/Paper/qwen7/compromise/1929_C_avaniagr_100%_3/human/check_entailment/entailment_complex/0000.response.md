Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes each test case individually.
2. It handles different scenarios based on the values of \(k\), \(x\), and \(a\).
3. The logic for determining whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins is sound:
   - If \(x < k - 1\), Sasha can always recover from one loss by placing a larger bet.
   - If \(x = k - 1\), Sasha can recover from two consecutive losses by placing a larger bet.
   - For \(x > k - 1\), Sasha needs to calculate the minimum number of coins required to recover from \(x - k + 3\) consecutive losses and check if he has enough initial coins \(a\).
4. The program correctly prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on these conditions.
5. The state of the program after processing each test case is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program logic matches the problem description and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
