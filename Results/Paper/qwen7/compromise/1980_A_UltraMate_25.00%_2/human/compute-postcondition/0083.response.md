Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `p`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 'A' and `p` is 'ABCDEF'.

3. **Determine the next state**: Since the loop iterates over each character in `p`, the next character in `p` that `i` will take is 'B'. The string `p` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to update the state of `i` to 'B' and keep `p` as 'ABCDEF'. The variable `ans` is not part of the loop head, so its state does not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEF'**
