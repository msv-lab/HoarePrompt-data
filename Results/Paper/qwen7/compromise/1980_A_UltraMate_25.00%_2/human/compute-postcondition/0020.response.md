Output State: **All characters in `p` ('ABCDEF') have been iterated over, and `ans` is equal to `m` multiplied by the length of `p` (6).**

Explanation: Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `'ABCDEF'`, and for each iteration, if the current character `i` is not found in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by `m`. Given that none of the characters in `p` are specified to be in `hmp`, `ans` will be incremented by `m` for each of the 6 iterations. Therefore, `ans` will be `m + m + m + m + m + m = 6 * m`.
