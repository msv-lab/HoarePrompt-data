Output State: **`i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is `m` + the previous value of `ans`**.

The code `ans += m` increments `ans` by the value of `m`. However, since the initial value of `ans` is not specified other than being equal to `m` plus its previous value (which is not given), we keep it in the form of `m + the previous value of ans`. The variables `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
