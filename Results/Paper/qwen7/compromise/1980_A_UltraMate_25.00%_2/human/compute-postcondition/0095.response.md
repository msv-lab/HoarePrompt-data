Output State: **`i` is 'A', `hmp` is {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'}, `ans` is `m - hmp['A']`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is set to 'A', and `hmp` is a set containing the elements 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F'. The code updates `ans` by adding the value of `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`. Since `i` is 'A', `hmp[i]` is `hmp['A']`, which is less than `m`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `ans + (m - hmp['A'])`. The other variables remain unchanged.
