Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of differences between \( m \) and the count of specific characters ('A' to 'F') in the string \( s \). This sum is computed for each character and each test case, and the final result is printed. The function effectively determines how many additional occurrences of characters 'A' to 'F' are needed to meet the requirement specified by \( m \) across all given strings in all test cases.**
