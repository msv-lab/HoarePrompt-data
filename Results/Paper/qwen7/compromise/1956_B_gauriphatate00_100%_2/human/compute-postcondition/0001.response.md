Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `num`, which iterates over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head objects**:
   - `num`: This variable will take on the values from the list `a` during each iteration.
   - `a`: This is the list being iterated over.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive) and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice, the list `a` can contain up to `2n` elements.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that the list `a` is not empty for the loop to execute. If `a` is empty, the loop will not run at all.
   - The value of `num` will change with each iteration, but before the loop starts, we only need to ensure that `a` is not empty.

5. **Consider the given state**:
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice.
   - `count_a` is an empty dictionary, which is not relevant to the loop head.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that the list `a` is not empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice**.
