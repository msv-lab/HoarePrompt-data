Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally.
- The provided code defines a function `func_1` that counts how many numbers in the list `a` appear exactly twice. This count is returned as `max_score`.
- However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game rules. Specifically, it does not account for the optimal strategy of both players, especially Nene's strategy to maximize her score while minimizing yours.
- The function assumes that having a number appear exactly twice in your hand means you can get a point for each such number, which is not necessarily true because Nene will counteract this by placing those numbers on the table first to prevent you from scoring points.
- The execution summary indicates that the function simply counts the numbers that appear exactly twice, which is not a correct approach to solving the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the optimal strategy required to solve the problem according to the game rules.
