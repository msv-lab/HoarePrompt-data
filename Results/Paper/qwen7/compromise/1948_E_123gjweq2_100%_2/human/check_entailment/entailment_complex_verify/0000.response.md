### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its behavior step-by-step to determine if it correctly partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.
   - It calls the `make_array` function to fill `arr` with values such that each segment of `arr` is set to the same value, resulting in `arr` being a list of `n` ones.
   - It prints `arr`, the calculated number of cliques, and `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - The function fills the array `arr` with values from `left` to `right - 1` such that the first half of the range is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`.
   - It sets the corresponding entries in the `cliquess` list to the value of `clique`.

Given the problem constraints and the behavior of the functions:
- For each segment defined by `i * k` to `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)`, the function assigns the same value to all elements in that segment.
- The segments are defined such that they cover the entire range from `0` to `n - 1` without overlap.
- The value assigned to each segment is `i + 1`, where `i` is the index of the segment.

Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- Input: `n = 5`, `k = 4`

Here, `ceil(5 / 4) = 2`, so the function will create 2 cliques.
- The segments will be:
  - Segment 1: From `0` to `3` (values: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - Segment 2: From `4` to `4` (value: 2)

Thus, the `arr` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 2]` and the `cliquess` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]`.

Now, let's check the edges:
- For segment 1 (`1, 2, 3, 4`):
  - All pairs `(i, j)` where `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= 4` will form an edge.
  - This segment forms a clique.
- For segment 2 (`2`):
  - This segment is trivially a clique since it only contains one element.

Therefore, the graph can indeed be partitioned into 2 cliques, which is the minimum possible number of cliques for this specific example.

The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program does not ensure the minimum number of cliques. In fact, the program correctly implements the logic to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints.
