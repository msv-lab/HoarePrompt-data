Reasoning:

1. The program correctly handles the input format and number of test cases.
2. For each test case, the program calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1 = a * n`: This represents the cost if each yogurt is bought individually at the regular price.
   - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: This represents the cost if the maximum number of pairs (of two yogurts) are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price.
3. The program then prints the minimum of these two calculated values, which is the correct approach to find the minimum cost.
4. The program correctly handles the case when \( n = 1 \) by printing the regular price \( a \).

Given the logic and the implementation, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
