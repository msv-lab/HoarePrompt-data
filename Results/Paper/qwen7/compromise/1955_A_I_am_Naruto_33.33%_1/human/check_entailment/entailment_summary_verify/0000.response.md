Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given examples.

### Analysis of the Given Program

The given program iterates over the test cases and calculates the cost based on the following logic:
- If \( n > 1 \):
  - `ans1` is calculated as \( a \times n \).
  - `ans2` is calculated as \( b \times \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + a \times (n \mod 2) \).
  - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

- If \( n = 1 \):
  - The program simply prints \( a \).

### Example Test Cases

Let's break down the given test cases with the provided program:

1. **Test Case: \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)**
   - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
   - Minimum cost: 9 (Correct)

2. **Test Case: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)**
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
   - Minimum cost: 14 (Correct)

3. **Test Case: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)**
   - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
   - Minimum cost: 15 (Incorrect according to the original assessment, but actually correct because buying 2 yogurts for 11 and 1 for 5 gives 16, which is more expensive than buying 3 for 15)

4. **Test Case: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)**
   - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
   - `ans2 = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
   - Minimum cost: 20 (Correct)

### Corrected Version of the Function

The original assessment suggested that the program incorrectly handles the case where buying in pairs using the promotion price is more beneficial. However, upon closer inspection, the program's logic is actually correct for the given examples. The issue lies in the misunderstanding of the original assessment.

The corrected version provided in the original assessment:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        singles = n % 2
        ans = pairs * b + singles * a
        print(ans)
```
is indeed correct. This version directly calculates the cost by determining the number of pairs and singles, ensuring the minimum cost is always calculated correctly.

### Conclusion

The original assessment was inaccurate because the given program correctly handles the problem as described. The corrected version provided in the original assessment is also correct but unnecessary since the original program already works correctly.

Final: **True**
