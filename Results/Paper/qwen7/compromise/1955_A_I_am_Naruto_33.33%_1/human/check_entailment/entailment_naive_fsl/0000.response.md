Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where buying in pairs using the promotion price is more beneficial than buying individually. Specifically, in the third test case of the example (3 5 11), it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles (since \( \frac{3}{2} \times 11 + 5 = 15 \)), but the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 16 burles (since \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \)).

The program should calculate the cost by determining how many pairs of yogurts can be bought and then adding the cost of any remaining individual yogurts. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        singles = n % 2
        ans = pairs * b + singles * a
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost for any given number of yogurts, prices, and promotion conditions.
