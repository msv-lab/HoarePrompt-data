Output State: The output state will consist of a series of minimum values calculated from the expressions `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` for each test case, where the specific values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are provided by the user input during each iteration of the loop. Each line of output will contain one such minimum value, corresponding to the result of the comparison for each test case.
