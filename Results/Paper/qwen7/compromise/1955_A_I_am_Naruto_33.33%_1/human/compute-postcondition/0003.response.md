Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, n, a, and b where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30. It does not return anything explicitly but implies processing these values internally for t test cases.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases (up to 10,000) where each test case involves three integers n, a, and b. The function processes these values for each of the t test cases without returning any explicit output from the function itself.
