### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads input from standard input and splits it into a list of strings. It correctly extracts the number of test cases (`t`), the length of each encoded string (`n`), and the encoded strings themselves.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the encoded string `b`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Creating String `r`**: The function `func_1` creates the string `r` by sorting and removing duplicates from the encoded string `b`. This part is correct.
   - **Mapping Characters**: It then creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character in `r`. This is done correctly.
   - **Decoding**: Finally, it decodes the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`. This part is also correct.

4. **Output**: The decoded strings are stored in the `results` list and printed at the end.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program correctly implements the decoding logic as required.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
