Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of `encoded` is between 1 and 200,000. For each character in `encoded`, the function returns a new string where each character is replaced by the character at the mirrored index as defined in the dictionary `mapping`.**
