#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string where each character in the input string 'encoded' is replaced by the character at the mirrored index as defined in the dictionary 'mapping'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string. In the returned string, each character from the input string is replaced by the character at the mirrored index as defined in a dictionary `mapping`. The dictionary `mapping` is created by sorting the unique characters in `encoded` and then pairing each character with its mirrored counterpart in the sorted list.
