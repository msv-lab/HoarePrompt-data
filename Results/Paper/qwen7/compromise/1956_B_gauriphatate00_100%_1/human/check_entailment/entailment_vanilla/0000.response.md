Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves two players, you and Nene, who take turns placing cards on a table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cards each player gets) and the list of numbers on your cards.
   - It calls a function `func_1` to calculate your maximum possible score.
   - The function `func_1` counts how many pairs of cards (with the same number) you have.
   - It returns the count of such pairs, which is the maximum number of points you can get because each pair allows you to score a point.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of pairs of cards in your hand.
   - Since Nene will always play optimally to minimize your score, having pairs of cards means you can score a point for each pair.
   - The logic in `func_1` directly corresponds to the optimal strategy for maximizing your score, given that Nene will play to minimize it.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases efficiently.
   - It correctly processes each test case and outputs the result for each.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get based on the given constraints and rules.

Correctness: **True**
