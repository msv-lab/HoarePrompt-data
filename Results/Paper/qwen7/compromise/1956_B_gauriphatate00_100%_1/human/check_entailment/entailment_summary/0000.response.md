Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game rules as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` simply counts how many numbers in the list appear exactly twice, which does not account for the strategic moves of both players throughout the game. The function does not consider the optimal strategy of Nene, who aims to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

According to the problem, Nene will always make optimal moves to maximize her score and minimize yours. This means that Nene will try to ensure that she gets points whenever possible, and she will also try to prevent you from getting points when she can.

Given this, the function `func_1` does not implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get under optimal play. Instead, it just counts the numbers that appear twice, which is not relevant to the game's outcome.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the rules of the game and does not account for the strategic behavior of Nene.

Correctness: **False**
