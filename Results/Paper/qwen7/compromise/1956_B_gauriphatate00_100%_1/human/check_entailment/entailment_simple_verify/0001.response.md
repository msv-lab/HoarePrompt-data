### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves two players, you and Nene, who take turns placing cards on a table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cards each player gets) and the list of numbers on your cards.
   - It calls a function `func_1` to calculate your maximum possible score.
   - The function `func_1` counts how many pairs of cards (with the same number) you have.
   - It returns the count of such pairs, which is the maximum number of points you can get because each pair allows you to score a point.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of pairs of cards in your hand.
   - However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the optimal strategy of Nene. The function only checks for pairs of cards in your hand but does not account for Nene's optimal play.
   - Nene will always try to prevent you from scoring points by playing optimally. Therefore, simply counting pairs of cards in your hand does not guarantee the maximum number of points you can get.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases efficiently.
   - It correctly processes each test case and outputs the result for each.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the optimal play of Nene, which is crucial for determining the maximum number of points you can get.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get based on the given constraints and rules. The function `func_1` only counts pairs of cards in your hand without considering Nene's optimal play.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
