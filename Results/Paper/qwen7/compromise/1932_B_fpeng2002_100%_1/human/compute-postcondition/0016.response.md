The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Given the information provided:

- `start_year` will be adjusted in each iteration of the loop according to the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the `nums` list.
- `x` will take on the value of the last index of the `nums` list after all iterations.

Since the loop head only involves `num_tests`, we need to ensure that `num_tests` is greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `num_tests`.

State: **`num_tests` must be greater than 0**
