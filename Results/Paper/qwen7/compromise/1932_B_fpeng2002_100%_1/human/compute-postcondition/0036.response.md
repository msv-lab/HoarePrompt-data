Output State: **`start_year` is equal to (0 // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x], `x` is 0, `num_tests` is equal to `num_tests - 1`, and `nums` must be a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code updates `start_year` to the value of `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given that `start_year` is initially 0 and `x` is 0, the expression simplifies to `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`. Since `nums` is a non-empty list, let's denote its first element as `nums[0]`. The value of `start_year` becomes `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, which is `1 * nums[0]` because `0 // nums[0]` is 0 (assuming `nums[0]` is not zero). Therefore, `start_year` is updated to `nums[0]`. The values of `x`, `num_tests`, and the condition on `nums` remain unchanged.
