Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `start_year` will be equal to `(start_year // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`, `nums` will be a list of integers, and `x` will be equal to the length of `nums` minus 1.

To explain this output state in natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `start_year` will be updated based on the last element of the `nums` list. Specifically, it will be set to the result of the expression `(start_year // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]`. The variable `x` will be equal to the index of the last element in the `nums` list, which is `len(nums) - 1`. The `nums` list itself and the initial value of `start_year` (which was 0) will remain unchanged except for the final assignment within the loop.
