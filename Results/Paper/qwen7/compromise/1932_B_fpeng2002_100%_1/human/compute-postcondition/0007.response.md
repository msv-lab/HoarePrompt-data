Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums))`. The objects involved here are `x`, `len(nums)`, and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` is the loop variable that will take values from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be at least 1 because the range function generates values from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - `x` will start at 0 and increment until it reaches `len(nums) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the given states**:
   - We know `num_tests` is greater than 0 - 1, but this doesn't directly affect the loop's execution. It's more about the relationship between `num_tests` and the loop.
   - `n` is an input integer, which doesn't affect the loop's execution directly.
   - `start_year` is 0, which also doesn't affect the loop's execution directly.

5. **Formulate the required state**:
   - Since the loop depends on `len(nums)` being at least 1, we need to ensure `len(nums)` is at least 1.
   - `x` will start at 0, so no adjustment is needed for `x` initially.
   - `nums` is a list of integers, and its length determines the number of iterations.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`len(nums)` must be at least 1, nums is a list of integers, x is 0**
