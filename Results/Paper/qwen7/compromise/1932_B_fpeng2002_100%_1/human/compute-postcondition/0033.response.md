Output State: **`start_year` is equal to the result of applying the operation `(start_year // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)` once, `x` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`, `num_tests` is equal to `num_tests - 1`, and `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the user and splits it into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `nums`. The values of `start_year`, `x`, `num_tests`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
