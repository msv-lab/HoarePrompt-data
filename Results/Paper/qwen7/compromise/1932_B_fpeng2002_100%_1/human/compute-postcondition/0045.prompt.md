Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_tests` is an input integer, and the values of `t` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `start_year` will be equal to `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for every `x` in the range of `len(nums)`, `nums` will be a list of integers, and `x` will be the last index value of `nums`.

In simpler terms, `start_year` will be adjusted in each iteration of the loop according to the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the `nums` list. By the end of the loop, `start_year` will reflect the final adjustment based on all elements in `nums`. The variable `x` will take on the value of the last index of the `nums` list after all iterations.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `start_year` is equal to the result of applying the operation `(start_year // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)` once, with `x` being equal to `len(nums) - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be updated to the final value obtained by performing the operation `(start_year // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)` where `x` takes the value of the last index in the `nums` list. All other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) will retain their final states as dictated by the loop's execution, but the key change will be in the value of `start_year`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `start_year` is equal to `(((0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0] // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1] // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`, `x` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`, `num_tests` is equal to `num_tests - 3`, and `nums` must be a non-empty list.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be updated to the final value calculated by successively applying the formula within the loop for each element in `nums`. The variable `x` will be equal to the last index of `nums`, `num_tests` will be reduced by the total number of iterations (which is 3 in this case), and `nums` must still be a non-empty list.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
