The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num_tests` is equal to the result of applying the operation `(start_year // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)` once, with `x` being equal to `len(nums) - 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0. Since `num_tests` is derived from the operation involving `start_year` and `len(nums)`, we need to ensure that the operation results in a value greater than 0.

State: **`start_year` is equal to the result of applying the operation `(start_year // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)` once, with `x` being equal to `len(nums) - 1`, and `num_tests` must be greater than 0.**
