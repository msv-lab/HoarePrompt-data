Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The key issue lies in the calculation of `start_year`. The provided code snippet uses the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the list `nums`, but this approach does not accurately simulate the sequential waiting period for each sign as described in the problem statement.

To correctly determine the year when the nth sign occurs, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities. This LCM will give us the year when all signs will occur sequentially.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        # Calculate the LCM of all numbers in the list
        start_year = reduce(lcm, nums)
        
        print(start_year)
```

With this corrected logic, the program will correctly compute the year when all signs will occur sequentially.

Correctness: **False**
