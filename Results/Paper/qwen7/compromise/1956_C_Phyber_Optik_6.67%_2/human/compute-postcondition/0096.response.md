Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations, with `j` being `n + r + 1` (which simplifies to `n + 1` since `r` starts at 0 and never changes), `n` remaining as the input integer, and `r` still at 0. The variable `sum` contains the total accumulated value based on the rules provided: for each `i` from 1 to `n`, if \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) is greater than \( i \times n \), then `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \); otherwise, `sum` is incremented by \( i \times n \).

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `j` will be `n + 1`, `n` will be the original input integer, `r` will be 0, and `sum` will be the total accumulated value calculated according to the specified rules.
