Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `r` is 1; `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`; the expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**

Explanation: The code `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the variable `sum` by adding the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since `n * (n + 1) // 2` is already defined as being greater than `i * n`, and `i` and `n` remain unchanged, the updated value of `sum` is exactly `n * (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `r`) remain in their initial or unchanged states.
