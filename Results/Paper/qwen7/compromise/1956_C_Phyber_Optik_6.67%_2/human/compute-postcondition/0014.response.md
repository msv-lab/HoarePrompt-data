Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` will be the other value in the range (1 or 2), `sum` is increased by n * (n + 1) // 2, `r` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The updated value of `sum` is the sum of its original value and `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
