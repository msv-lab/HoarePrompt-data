Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + r + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range from 1 to `n + r + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is incremented from 1 to `n + r`, and `j` is greater than `n`.

4. **Analyze the loop termination condition**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + r + 1`. Since `j` is already greater than `n`, it needs to be less than or equal to `n + r + 1` to continue.

5. **Adjust the state**: Given that `j` is currently greater than `n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be set to a value that is still within the range of the loop, i.e., `j` should be set to `n + r + 1`.

6. **Consider the constraints on `r`**: The value of `r` remains non-negative but does not change further. This means `r` stays the same.

7. **Formulate the new state**: Since `j` must be set to `n + r + 1` for the loop to execute one more time, and `n` and `r` remain unchanged, the new state will reflect this adjustment.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is `n + r + 1`, `n` remains the same, `r` remains the same**
