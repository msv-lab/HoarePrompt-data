Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop increments `j` from 1 to `n + r`, so the final value of `j` at the end of the loop is `n + r`.
- The condition `j > n` holds true at the end of the loop, meaning `r` remains non-negative but does not change further.

Given this information, we can determine the values for the `print` statement:

- The first value printed is `1`.
- The second value printed is `j`, which is `n + r` at the end of the loop.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1 n + r**
