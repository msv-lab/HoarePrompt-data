Output: **1 2 3 ... n**

Explanation: 
- The variable `j` is explicitly given as 2, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- The variable `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact range of numbers to be printed.
- The variable `r` is explicitly given as 0, but it is also not used in the `print` statement.
- The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print all integers from 1 up to and including `n`.

Since the value of `n` is not specified, the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.
