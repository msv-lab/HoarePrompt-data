Output State: **`i` is 2; `r` is 2; `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` updates the `sum` variable by adding the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. However, since `n` is not defined in the initial state and no value is provided for `n`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `sum`. But we know that `sum` is now equal to `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The values of `i` and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
