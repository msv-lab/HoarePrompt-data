Output State: **`sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `j` will be `n + r + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `t` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sum` and `r` to 0. This changes the values of `sum` and `r`, but does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, `i`, and `t`. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
