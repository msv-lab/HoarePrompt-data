Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, or `2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 3.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - Therefore, `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Variable `sum`:**
   - `sum` is determined based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2` compared to `2 * n`.
   - Since `sum` is not modified within the loop, its value remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that changes within the loop head is `i`.
- `i` will be incremented from 2 to 3.
- `n` and `sum` remain unchanged.

### Updated State:
- `i` is now 3.
- `n` is still an input integer.
- `sum` is still either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, or `2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, and `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n`, or `2 * n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`.**
