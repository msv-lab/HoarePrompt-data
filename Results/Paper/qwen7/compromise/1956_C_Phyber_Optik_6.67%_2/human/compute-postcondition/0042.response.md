Given the initial state where `j` is defined as `n + r + 1`, and both `n` and `r` remain the same, we need to focus on the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement.

- `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object so that it is passed as individual arguments to the `print` function.

Since the exact values of `n` and `r` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `j`. However, the `print` statement will generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n** (where `n` is the value of `n` in the initial state)
