Output State: **`i` is 3; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `sum` is `i * n` which is `3 * n`.**

The code updates the `sum` variable by adding the product of `i` (which is 3) and `n` to the current value of `sum`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the updated `sum` is `3 * n`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
