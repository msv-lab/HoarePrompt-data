Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` will be the other value in the range (1 or 2), `sum` remains unchanged, `r` is equal to `i`.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `r`. Since `i` can only be 1 or 2, `r` will also be either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
