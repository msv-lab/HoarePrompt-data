Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Initial State:**
   - We have an integer `n`.
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, we need to decide whether to add `i * n` or `n * (n + 1) / 2` to `sum`.
   - If `n * (n + 1) / 2` is greater than `i * n`, then `r` is set to `i` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - Otherwise, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.

2. **Iterating Through the Loop:**
   - For `i = 1`, `n * (n + 1) / 2` is always greater than `1 * n` (since `n * (n + 1) / 2` is at least `1 * (1 + 1) / 2 = 1`).
     - So, `r` is set to `1` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - For `i = 2`, `n * (n + 1) / 2` is greater than `2 * n` only if `n < 3`.
     - If `n >= 3`, `r` is set to `2` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
     - If `n < 3`, `sum` is incremented by `2 * n`.
   - This pattern continues until `i = n`.
     - For `i = n`, `n * (n + 1) / 2` is always greater than `n * n` (since `n * (n + 1) / 2` is at least `n * (n + 1) / 2`).
       - So, `r` is set to `n` and `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

3. **Final Values:**
   - After all iterations, `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` will still be the input integer.
   - `sum` will be the total accumulated value based on the above rules.

4. **Calculating `sum`:**
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, if `n * (n + 1) / 2` is greater than `i * n`, `sum` is incremented by `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - Otherwise, `sum` is incremented by `i * n`.
   - The maximum value added to `sum` in each iteration is `n * (n + 1) / 2`.

5. **Output:**
   - `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) / 2` repeated `n` times.
   - This simplifies to `sum = n * (n * (n + 1) / 2) = n^2 * (n + 1) / 2`.

6. **Final Print Statement:**
   - The print statement will output `sum` and `n + r`.
   - Since `r` is set to `i` at each step where `n * (n + 1) / 2` is greater than `i * n`, and `i` ranges from 1 to `n`, `r` will be `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **n^2 * (n + 1) / 2, n + n**
