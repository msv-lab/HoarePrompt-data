Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `j`, `n`, and `r`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - We know that after all iterations of the loop, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - We also know that `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - The value of `sum` is determined based on certain conditions involving `n` and `i`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + r + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `n + r + 1`, the variable `j` will take values from `1` to `n + r + 1`.
   - The variable `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `r` is not directly mentioned in the final state conditions but is part of the loop condition.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start and run correctly. Therefore, we need to set the initial state such that the loop can execute properly.

**State:**
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `r` can be any non-negative integer (since it is not specified further).

Thus, the required state adjustments are:

**State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is any non-negative integer**.
