Output State: The final value of `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` from 1 to `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` for each `i`, or the sum of `i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` for any `i`.

In simpler terms, if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` for every `i` from 1 to `n`, then `sum` will be `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` will be the sum of `i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n`.

This means that if `n` is small enough such that `n * (n + 1) // 2` is always greater than `i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `sum` will be `n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` will be the sum of the first `n` multiples of `n`, which is `n * (1 + 2 + ... + n) = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`.
