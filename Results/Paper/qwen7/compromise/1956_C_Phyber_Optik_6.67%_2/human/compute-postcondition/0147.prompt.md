Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer equal to the input integer, and `n` is an integer with a value within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. The sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    sum, r = 0, 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
            r = i
            sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
        else:
            sum += i * n
    print(sum, n + r)
    for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
        if j <= n:
            print(1, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        else:
            print(2, j % n, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will be `n + r + 1`, `n` will still be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, `r` will remain non-negative and unchanged, and `i` will be equal to `n + 1`. The variable `sum` will contain the sum described in the initial state, and `t` will be greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The loop will have executed from `j = 1` to `j = n + r + 1`. Given the initial conditions and the fact that `r` is not changed within the loop, `r` will remain 0. Therefore, the loop will run from `j = 1` to `j = n + 1`.

For each iteration:
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop prints `1` followed by `j` and then a range from `1` to `n`.
- If `j` is greater than `n`, the loop prints `2` followed by `j % n` and then a range from `1` to `n`.

After all iterations, the variable `j` will be `n + 1`, `n` will still be the input integer, and `r` will be `0`.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:
Output State: `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is the input integer, and `r` is `0`. The loop has printed the specified sequences for each value of `j` from `1` to `n + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop will continue to increment `j` until it reaches `n + r + 1`. For each iteration, if `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it will print "1 j" followed by a space and then the numbers from 1 to `n`. If `j` is greater than `n`, it will print "2 (j % n)" followed by a space and then the numbers from 1 to `n`. The final output will consist of lines printed during each iteration of the loop, with `j` ranging from 1 to `n + r + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
