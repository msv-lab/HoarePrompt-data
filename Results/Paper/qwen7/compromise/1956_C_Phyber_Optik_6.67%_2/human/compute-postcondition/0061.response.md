Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `sum` is `2 * n`**

Explanation: The variable `sum` is updated to be the current value of `sum` plus the product of `i` (which is 2) and `n`. Since `n` is an input integer, the exact value of `sum` depends on the value of `n`, but it is explicitly stated as `2 * n`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
