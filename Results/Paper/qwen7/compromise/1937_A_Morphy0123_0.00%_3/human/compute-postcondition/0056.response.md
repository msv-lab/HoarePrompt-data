Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`.
   - This means the loop will continue as long as `power` is less than the base-2 logarithm of `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `power` is 7.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 5.
   - `i` is either 3 or 6.
   - `n` must be greater than 64.

3. **Determine What Needs Adjustment**:
   - The loop head only involves `power` and `n`.
   - Therefore, the only variables that need adjustment are `power` and `n`.

4. **Adjust `power`**:
   - Since `power` is currently 7, for the loop to continue, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.

5. **Adjust `n`**:
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be such that `log2(n)` is greater than 7.
   - This means \(n > 2^7 = 128\).

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`, and `n` must be greater than 128.

### Final Answer:
State: **`power` must be less than `log2(n)` and `n` must be greater than 128**
