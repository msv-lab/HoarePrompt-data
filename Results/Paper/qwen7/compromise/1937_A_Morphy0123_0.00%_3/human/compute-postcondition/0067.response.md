Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 3 or 6, `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than 128, and `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`. If `n` equals 1, `power` is set to 4. Otherwise, if `power` equals `n`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `power` is adjusted to be within the range `[log2(n) - 1, log2(n))`.
