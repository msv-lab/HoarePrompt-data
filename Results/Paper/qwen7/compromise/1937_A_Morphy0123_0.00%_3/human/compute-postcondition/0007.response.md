Output State: **`power` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is not equal to 1**

The code initializes the variable `power` to 1. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
