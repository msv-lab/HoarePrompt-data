Output State: **`power` is 3, `n` must be greater than 8, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 4, `n` is not equal to 1, and `power` is not equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The `power` variable is decremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 3. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
