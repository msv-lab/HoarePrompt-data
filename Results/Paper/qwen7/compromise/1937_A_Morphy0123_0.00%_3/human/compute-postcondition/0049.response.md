Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 3 or 6, `n` is the integer input from the user, `power` is 4 if `n` equals 1, otherwise `power` is 4 if it does not equal `n` and remains 5 if it does equal `n`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `power`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The value of `power` is determined based on the new value of `n` according to the given conditions.
