Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 2 or 5, `n` is an input integer, `power` is an integer, and `n` must be greater than 8 if `i` is 5. If `n` equals 1, then `power` remains 4. Otherwise, `power` is 4 if it does not equal `n`, and remains 5 if it does equal `n`.
