Output State: `power` is greater than or equal to `log2(n)` but less than `log2(n) + 1`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n_cases` must be greater than 5; `i` is either 3 or 6; `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than 128.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`, and `n` must be greater than 128. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
