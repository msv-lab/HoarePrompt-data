Let's reason through the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks into an array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1(arr)` is defined to calculate the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`.
   - It iterates over the array `arr` and updates the frequency count for each stick length.

3. **Polygon Formation:**
   - To form a regular polygon, each polygon requires at least 3 sides of equal length.
   - The code calculates the number of complete polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 (since each polygon has 4 sides).
   - The `sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))` expression sums up the integer division results for all stick lengths, effectively counting how many complete polygons can be formed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where there are not enough sticks to form even a triangle (3 sides), which is correctly represented by the integer division result being zero.
   - However, the code does not explicitly handle the case where there are fewer than 3 sticks of the same length, which would also prevent forming a polygon.

### Analysis:

- The logic in `func_1` is sound for determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.
- The code correctly counts the number of complete polygons by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4.
- The code does not explicitly check if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length before performing the division, but this is implicitly handled by the integer division operation itself (i.e., if there are fewer than 3 sticks, the division will result in 0).

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the code appears to be correct. It accurately calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
