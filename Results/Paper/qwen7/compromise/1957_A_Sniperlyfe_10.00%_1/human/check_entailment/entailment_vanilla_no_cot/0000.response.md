Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has an error in its logic. The function `func_1` calculates the number of complete regular polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 (since a polygon needs at least 3 sides, but the question asks for regular polygons which typically have more than 3 sides, like triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.). However, this approach does not correctly account for the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with the given constraints.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the maximum number of polygons that can be formed such that each polygon uses exactly 3 or more sticks of the same length without exceeding the total number of sticks available. The current implementation does not handle this correctly because it always divides by 4, which is not appropriate for all polygon types (e.g., triangles require 3 sticks).

A correct approach would involve iterating through possible polygon sides (starting from 3 up to the minimum frequency of any stick length) and counting how many complete polygons can be formed for each type before moving to the next polygon type. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each stick length
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    
    max_polygons = 0
    # Try to form polygons starting from triangles (3 sides)
    for sides in range(3, min(freq.values()) + 1):
        polygons = 0
        for count in freq.values():
            polygons += count // sides
        max_polygons = max(max_polygons, polygons)
    
    print(max_polygons)
```

This corrected version iterates over possible polygon sides, calculates how many complete polygons can be formed for each side length, and keeps track of the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.
