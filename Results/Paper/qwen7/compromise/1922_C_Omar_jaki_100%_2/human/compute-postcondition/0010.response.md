Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `a` is a tuple of at least 4 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)]`, `v` is `y - x`**.

Explanation: The initial state of `t` is `t - 2`, which means `t` is already updated. The variable `a` remains a tuple of at least 4 elements as its state was not affected by the code. The list `b` is updated by adding two new elements. The first new element is `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`, and the second new element is `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`. The variable `v` remains unchanged and is still `y - x`.
