Output State: **`u` is 0, `t` is `t - 2 * n - 1`, `a` is a tuple with at least `n + 3` elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v * (v > z - y) + b[-2] + v * (v > x - w)]` extended for each iteration, `v` is `y - x`, `c` and `d` are updated to the values returned by `r()`**

Explanation: The function `r()` is called, which updates the values of `c` and `d`. However, the exact values of `c` and `d` are not specified, so they are simply updated to the values returned by `r()`. The other variables (`u`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `v`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
