Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is reduced to the first value from the input split by spaces, `n`, `a`, `m` remain unchanged, `r` is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `u` is `0`, `t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is a tuple with at least `n + 3` elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v * (v > z - y) + b[-2] + v * (v > x - w)]` extended for each iteration, `v` is `y - x`, `c` and `d` are updated to the values returned by `r()`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `u` will be reduced to `0` since it is decremented by `1` in each iteration and starts from a positive value. The variable `t` will be reduced by `2 * n` for each iteration, so after all iterations, it will be `t - 2 * n`. The tuple `a` and list `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The values of `v`, `c`, and `d` will be updated to the last values returned by the function `r()`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: After all iterations, `u` is 0, `c` is the return value of `r()` from the last iteration, and `d` is the second return value of `r()` from the last iteration.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `total` is 0, `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`, `t` is false, `a` must have at least 6 elements, `b` is a list containing `[0, 0, 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x), 2 * (y - x)]`, `v` is `y - x`, `b[-2]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `b[-1]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `b[2]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `b[3]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `b[4]` is `2 * (y - x)`, `u` is false.

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `u` will eventually become false due to the decrement operation `u -= 1` inside the loop. The loop does not modify the values of `total`, `c`, `d`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `v`, and `u` directly within its body. Therefore, these variables retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. Since `u` becomes false, the loop stops executing, and no further changes occur to the variables outside the loop.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
