Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])`.

2. **Understand the variables in the loop head**:
   - `w` is assigned the value from `a`.
   - `x` is assigned the value from `a[1:]`.
   - `y` is assigned the value from `a[2:]`.
   - `z` is assigned the value from `a[3:]`.

3. **Analyze the list `a`**:
   - `a` is given as `[-1000000000.0, 0, 0]`.

4. **Determine the slices**:
   - `a[1:]` is `[0, 0]`.
   - `a[2:]` is `[0]`.
   - `a[3:]` is `[]`.

5. **Check the `zip` function**:
   - The `zip` function will pair elements from the iterables until the shortest iterable is exhausted.
   - Here, `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])` will produce pairs as follows:
     - `(a[0], a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]) = (-1000000000.0, [0, 0], [0], [])`
     - The loop will stop after this because `a[3:]` is an empty list.

6. **Determine the initial values for `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`**:
   - `w` will be `-1000000000.0`.
   - `x` will be `[0, 0]`.
   - `y` will be `[0]`.
   - `z` will be `[]`.

7. **Adjust the states**:
   - `w` is directly derived from `a[0]`.
   - `x` is derived from `a[1:]`.
   - `y` is derived from `a[2:]`.
   - `z` is derived from `a[3:]`.

Since the loop will only execute if there are enough elements to form a tuple in each iteration, we need to ensure that the list `a` has at least 4 elements to satisfy the `zip` function.

Given the current state of `a` having only 3 elements, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `a` has at least 4 elements.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`, `t` is false, `a` must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list containing `[0, 0]`**
