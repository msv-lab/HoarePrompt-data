Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is explicitly given as 2.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

This will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak` and `i` twice. Specifically:
- `mak` is 2.
- `i` is 3.

So, the output will be:
Output: **'? 2 2 3 3'**
