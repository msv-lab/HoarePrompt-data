Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is explicitly given as 0.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but this value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

This will print a string followed by the values of `mak` and `i`, repeated twice. Since `mak` is 0 and `i` is 1, the output will be:
Output: **'? 0 0 1 1'**
