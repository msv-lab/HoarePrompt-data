To understand the task, let's break down the information given and the requirements for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the range of values provided by `int(input())`.

2. **External Interaction**: The problem involves making at most \(3n\) queries to determine the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. This means that the loop will run for each query made to the external entity.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are more queries left to make. The number of queries is determined by the input value, which is read from the standard input using `int(input())`.

4. **Adjusting States**: Since the loop head variables are `_` (which is just a placeholder) and the loop's execution depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is correctly set up for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:

Given that the loop will execute based on the input value, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value itself. The loop will run for each integer value provided by the user until no more queries are needed.

### Final Answer:

State: **The input value must be a positive integer representing the number of queries to be made.**

This ensures that the loop can execute according to the problem's requirements.
