Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is equal to `n`
- `mak2` is equal to `n-1`
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`
- `s` is the string `'>', n` if the input is `<`, otherwise it is the same as above

The `print` statement is:

```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Here's the breakdown of the values being printed:

- `mak` is `n`
- `mak` is again `n`
- `i` is `n`
- `i` is again `n`

So, the print statement will output the string `?` followed by the value of `n` repeated four times.

Output: **? n n n n**
