Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is an empty list, `n` must be at least 1**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is an operation related to how the program interacts with the console rather than changing the state of variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
