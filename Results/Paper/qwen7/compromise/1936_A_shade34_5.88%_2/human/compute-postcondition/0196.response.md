Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 3, `pans` is an empty list, `mak` is `n-1`, and `k` is `k-n+2`.**

Explanation: The line `pans = []` initializes the variable `pans` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of `mak2`, `i`, `n`, `mak`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
