Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` must be within the range `[1, n-1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n`, `s` is the string `'>', n` is the input integer, the current value of the input string is `<`.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values of `mak2`, `i`, `n`, `pans`, and `s` stay the same as they were in the initial state.
