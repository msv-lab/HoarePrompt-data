Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list that either contains the element `n-1` or contains `i` (which is `n-1`), `s` is the string input by the user, and `s` is either not equal to `<` or equal to `=`.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only ensures that all previously written output is actually sent to the terminal. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
