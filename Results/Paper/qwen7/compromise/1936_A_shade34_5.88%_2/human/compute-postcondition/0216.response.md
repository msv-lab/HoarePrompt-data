Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is the new string input by the user, `mak` is equal to `i`**.

Explanation: The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `n`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 3 remains unchanged. The variable `s` is reassigned to a new string input by the user, indicating that it holds the latest input string.
