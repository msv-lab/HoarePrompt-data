Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is a list of length `n`, and `mak` is equal to `n-1` if the input string is '>' for every iteration from 1 to `n-1`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the standard output. Since no variables are modified by this command, the values of `i`, `pans`, and `mak` remain unchanged from their initial states.
