Output State: **`mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n`, `i` is 1, `pans` is `[0]`, `s` is the string entered by the user and is equal to '=', `n` is the input integer from the user.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `pans`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1. So, `i` becomes 1. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, `pans`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
