Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `pans`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(pans)`. This means `i` should start from 1 and go up to the length of the list `pans`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n-1`, we need to adjust it to start from 1 for the loop to execute correctly.
   - Therefore, `i` must be set to 1.

5. **Adjust the state of `pans`**:
   - The length of `pans` is `n`, as it contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.
   - For the loop to execute, `len(pans)` must be at least 1 (which it is since `n` is a positive integer).

6. **Other variables**:
   - `mak`, `mak2`, `s`, and `n` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` must be set to 1.
- `pans` must be a list of length `n` (which it already is).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `pans` is a list of length `n`**
