Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(pans))`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `mak` is equal to `i`.
   - If the user has entered a string which is equal to '>', the state remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is less than `len(pans)`.

4. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `mak` is equal to `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - If the user has entered a string which is equal to '>', the state remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `mak` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `pans` must still have at least 2 elements.
   - If the user has entered a string which is equal to '>', the state remains unchanged.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `pans` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `mak` will be `i + 1` (which was `i` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - If the user has entered a string which is equal to '>', the state remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`pans` must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is equal to `i + 1`, and if the user has entered a string which is equal to '>', the state remains unchanged**.
