Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `n-1`. This means `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `n-2` (since `n-1` is excluded).

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is `i`
   - `mak2` is `n - 1`
   - `i` must be within the range `[1, n-1]`
   - `n` must be greater than `1`
   - `pans` is a list containing the elements `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n`, and `s` is the string `'>', n` is the input integer.

4. **Analyze the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n-1`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n-2` (as per the previous iteration), the next value of `i` would be `n-1`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `n-1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `mak` will still be `i`, which is now `n-1`.
   - `mak2` remains `n - 1`.
   - `i` will be `n-1`.
   - `n` remains greater than `1`.
   - `pans` and `s` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than `1`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n`, and `s` is the string `'>', n` is the input integer.**
