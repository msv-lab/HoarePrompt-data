Output State: **`pans` must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is equal to `i`, and the user has entered a string which is equal to '>'**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. The initial conditions for `pans` and the user's input string remain unchanged. Therefore, `pans` still must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is now equal to `i`, and the user's input string is still '>'.
