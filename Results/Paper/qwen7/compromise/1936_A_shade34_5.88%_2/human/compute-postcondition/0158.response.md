Output State: **`i` is 2, `pans` is a list of length `n`.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` or `pans`. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are modified by this line of code, the values of `i` and `pans` remain unchanged.
