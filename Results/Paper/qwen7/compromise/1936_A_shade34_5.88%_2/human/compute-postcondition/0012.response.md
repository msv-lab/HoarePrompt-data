Output State: **`mak` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that any buffered data is written to the console immediately. Since no variables are assigned or modified, the values of `mak`, `i`, and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
