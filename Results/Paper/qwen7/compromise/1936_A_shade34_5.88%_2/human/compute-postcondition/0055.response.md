Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing `n-1` and `n-1`, `mak` is `n`, `s` is the string input by the user as a result of `str(input())`**.

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is `n`) to `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `mak2` is still equal to `n-1`, `i` is still `n`, `pans` remains a list containing `n-1` and `n-1`, and `s` remains the string input by the user.
