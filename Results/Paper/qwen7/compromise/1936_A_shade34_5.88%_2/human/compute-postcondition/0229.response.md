Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 3, `s` is an input string, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` from the previous iteration and the current value of `i`, which is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is `n + 1`) to the list `pans`. The initial conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `s` remains an input string. The updated list `pans` now includes both the previous value of `i` and the current value of `i`, which is `n + 1`.
