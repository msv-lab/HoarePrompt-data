Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak2` is equal to `mak`
- `mak` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `pans` is an empty list
- `n` must be at least 1

We can determine the values of the variables that will be printed:

- Since `mak` is `n-1` and `n` is at least 1, `mak` will be 0 (because if `n` is 1, then `mak` is `1-1`).
- Similarly, `mak2` is also `n-1`, so it will be 0.
- `i` is also `n-1`, so it will be 0.
- `mak2` is 0.

Therefore, the print statement `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)` will print:

Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
