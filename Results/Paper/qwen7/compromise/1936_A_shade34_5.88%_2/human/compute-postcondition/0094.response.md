Postcondition: `mak` is `i`, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` must be within the range `[1, n-1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n - 1`, `n - 1`, `n`, and `s` is the string `'>', n` is the input integer, because the input string is `<`, the function sets `mak` to `i` and does not change `mak2`, `i`, `n`, `pans`, or `s`.
