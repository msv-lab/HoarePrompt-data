Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be at least 3, but its exact value is not specified.
- `pans` is a list of length `n`, but its contents are not relevant to the print statement.
- `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the input is '<' or not, but the actual value of `mak` is not specified.
- `k` is `k-2`, but since `k` itself is not given, we only need to focus on the values that are explicitly provided or can be directly determined from the given information.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Given the values:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `mak` is either 0 or 1.
- `i` is 2.

So, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? 0 0 2 2' or '? 1 1 2 2'**
