Postcondition: `mak` is `i`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`, and `s` is the string `'>', n` is the input integer, if the input is `<`. Otherwise, `mak` is `i`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1`, `n-1`, `n`, and `s` is the string `'>', n` is the input integer.
