Output State: **`i` is 1; `mak` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The precondition that `pans` is a list of length `n` and the user has inputted a string equal to '>' which is true, remains unaffected by the code execution.
