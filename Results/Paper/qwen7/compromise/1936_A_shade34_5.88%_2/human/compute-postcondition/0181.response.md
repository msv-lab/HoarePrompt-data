Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 3
   - `pans` is a list of length `n`
   - `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the input is '<' or not
   - `k` is `k-1`

3. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 1. Given that `n` must be at least 3, it will indeed be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Formulate the New State**: Based on the above adjustments, the new state should reflect these changes.

Therefore, the new state is:
**`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `pans` is a list of length `n`, `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the input is '<' or not, and `k` is `k-2`.**

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `pans` is a list of length `n`, `mak` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the input is '<' or not, and `k` is `k-2`**
