Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, which is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing `n-1`, `n-1`, and `n`, `s` is the string input by the user as a result of `str(input())`**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `i` (which is `n`) to the list `pans`. Initially, `pans` contains `[n-1, n-1]`. After appending `i` (which is `n`), `pans` becomes `[n-1, n-1, n]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
