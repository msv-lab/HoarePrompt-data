Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input itself, which is converted to an integer and used as the range limit.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`
   - `pans` is a list of length `n`
   - `mak` is equal to `n-1` if the input string is '>' for every iteration from 1 to `n-1`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the input integer is greater than 0. After each iteration, the input integer is decremented by 1 (since it's used as the range limit).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The input integer will be decremented by 1.
   - `i` will be set to `n-1` again because the loop starts with `i` equal to `n-1`.
   - `pans` will remain a list of length `n`.
   - `mak` will depend on the new value of the input integer. If the input integer is still greater than 0, `mak` will be `n-1` if the input string is '>', otherwise `mak` will remain 0.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- The input integer will be decremented by 1, so if it was `k` before, it will now be `k-1`.
- `i` will be `n-1`.
- `pans` will remain a list of length `n`.
- `mak` will be `n-1` if the input string is '>', otherwise `mak` will remain 0.

Since we don't know the exact value of the input integer from the previous iteration, we'll denote it as `k`. Therefore, the state for the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is a list of length `n`, and `mak` is equal to `n-1` if the input string is '>' for every iteration from 1 to `n-1`; otherwise, `mak` remains 0. The input integer `k` is now `k-1`.**
