Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues:

1. **Incomplete Function 3**: The function `func_3` is defined but not implemented. It should calculate the maximum possible sum after performing `k` operations, which is crucial for solving the problem.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**: The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum subarray, but it doesn't correctly handle the logic for updating the maximum segment. Specifically, it doesn't properly manage the start and end indices of the segments and how they contribute to the final result.

3. **Lack of Main Logic**: There is no main logic to handle the input, process the operations, and compute the final result based on the given constraints.

### Corrected Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the array can be increased by inserting sums of subarrays multiple times. If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, we can effectively make the array's sum as large as possible by inserting the sum of the entire array `k` times.

2. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be very large, we need to take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import *

MOD = 1000000007

def max_possible_sum(n, k, arr):
    # Calculate the initial sum of the array
    initial_sum = sum(arr)
    
    # If k is greater than or equal to the length of the array, we can make the sum as large as possible
    if k >= n:
        return (initial_sum * k) % MOD
    
    # Otherwise, we just use the initial sum as the maximum possible sum
    return initial_sum % MOD

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    print(max_possible_sum(n, k, arr))
```

This solution directly calculates the maximum possible sum based on the given constraints and handles the modulo operation appropriately.
