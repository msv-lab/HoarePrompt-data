The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. Each element in `arr` is in the range from -10^9 to 10^9. The function calculates and returns `total_max_segment`, which is the segment with the maximum length among all segments in `segments_variants` that has the highest sum.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, and returns the segment with the maximum length that has the highest sum among all possible segments.**
