Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found in `arr`, `arr` is the list of integers provided, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the last segment considered before finding a new one with a potentially higher sum, `segments_variants` is a list of all segments that had the highest sum at some point during the loop's execution, `segments_variants` now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]` to the list `segments_variants`. This means that the last segment considered (`max_segment`) along with the index `len(arr) - 1` (which is the last index of the array `arr`) is added to the list `segments_variants`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
