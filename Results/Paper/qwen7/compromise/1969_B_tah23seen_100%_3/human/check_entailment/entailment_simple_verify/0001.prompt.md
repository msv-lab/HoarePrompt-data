You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a binary string, `cost` is the total cost calculated based on the conditions in the loop, `one` is the count of consecutive '1's encountered before encountering a '0'.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total cost calculated based on the conditions in the loop for the given binary string 's'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring `s[l:r]` costs `r - l + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls a function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1(s)` calculates the cost to sort the string `s`.

3. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis:**
   - It initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments `one`.
     - If the character is '0' and there has been at least one '1' (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to `cost`.
   - This logic seems to be an attempt to count the number of "blocks" of zeros that need to be moved past ones to sort the string.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1(s)` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for cyclic shifts.
   - The approach of counting blocks of zeros and adding `one + 1` does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts.
   - For example, consider the string "101011":
     - The correct solution would involve multiple cyclic shifts, but the current logic would incorrectly compute the cost as 9.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's verify with the provided examples:
     - For "10", the correct cost is 2 (shift the entire string).
     - For "0000", the correct cost is 0 (already sorted).
     - For "11000", the correct cost is 9 (as explained in the note).
     - For "101011", the correct cost is 5 (not 9).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided function `func_1(s)` does not correctly compute the minimum cost for cyclic shifts to sort the string.
