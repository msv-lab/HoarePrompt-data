Output State: `i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list starting with 1000 and followed by `n-1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[0] - sum(T[:i])`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1`, assuming `n` was initially greater than 1. The list `a` will start with the value 1000 and will contain `n-1` more elements. Each subsequent element in `a` (from the second element onwards) will be the initial value 1000 minus the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from the list `T`.
