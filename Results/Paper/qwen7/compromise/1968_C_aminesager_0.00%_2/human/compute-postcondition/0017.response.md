Output State: **The list `a` is joined into a string with each element separated by a space, and `i` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` converts the list `a` into a string where each element is converted to a string and separated by a space. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to `n`. The original state of `a` being reversed and `n` remaining unchanged is preserved.
