Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` contains an element which is `a[0] - T[0]`**

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` appends to the list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]` and `T[i - 1]` is `T[0]`. Therefore, `a` now contains the element `a[0] - T[0]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
