Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `line` is an input string**

The code `line = input('')` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is still 0, and `n` remains an input integer as it was not affected by the code.
