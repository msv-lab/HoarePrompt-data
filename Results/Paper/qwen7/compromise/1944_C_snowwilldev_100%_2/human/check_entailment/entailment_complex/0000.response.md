Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**: The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob. The logic inside the function does not account for the alternating turns and the specific rules of the game. Instead, it tries to find the smallest integer `i` such that `cnt[i] == 1` or `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2, which is not relevant to the game's outcome.

2. **Game Simulation Missing**: The program should simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a` and appending them to `c` or directly removing them from `a`. The function should keep track of the elements picked by Alice and Bob and calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

3. **Return Value**: The function should return the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, not an intermediate value `i`.

Given these issues, the annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
