### Reasoning

The original assessment is incorrect because the provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob. Let's break down the issues and provide a correct solution.

#### Issues in the Original Program

1. **Incorrect Simulation of Turns**:
   - The original program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each element and returns the first `i` that meets certain conditions.
   - This does not reflect the game dynamics where Alice and Bob make choices based on the remaining elements in the array.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The original program does not build the array `c` as Alice's choices and does not account for Bob's removals.
   - The returned value is not the MEX of the array `c` formed by Alice's choices.

3. **No Simulation of Game Play**:
   - The original program does not simulate the sequence of moves by Alice and Bob, which is crucial for determining the MEX of the final array `c`.

#### Correct Approach

To correctly simulate the game, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Simulate Alice's and Bob's Moves**:
   - Alice picks the smallest available element from `a` that hasn't been chosen yet.
   - Bob picks the largest available element from `a`.

2. **Track Choices**:
   - Maintain two lists to track Alice's and Bob's choices.

3. **Calculate MEX**:
   - After the game ends, calculate the MEX of the array formed by Alice's choices.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize counters
    alice_choices = []
    bob_choices = []
    
    i = 0
    j = 0
    
    while i < N and j < N:
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
            if a[i] not in bob_choices:
                alice_choices.append(a[i])
                a.pop(i)
                i += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        else:  # Bob's turn
            if a[j] not in alice_choices:
                bob_choices.append(a[j])
                a.pop(j)
                j += 1
            else:
                j += 1
    
    # Calculate MEX of Alice's choices
    mex = 0
    seen = set(alice_choices)
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    
    return mex

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Simulating the Game**:
   - Initialize two lists `alice_choices` and `bob_choices` to track Alice's and Bob's choices.
   - Use two pointers `i` and `j` to simulate Alice's and Bob's turns.
   - On Alice's turn, append the smallest available element from `a` to `alice_choices` if it is not already in `bob_choices`.
   - On Bob's turn, append the largest available element from `a` to `bob_choices` if it is not already in `alice_choices`.

3. **Calculating MEX**:
   - After the game ends, calculate the MEX of the array `alice_choices` by finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `alice_choices`.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the analysis and the corrected program, the original assessment was incorrect. The provided program did not correctly simulate the game and did not return the correct MEX value.

**Final: False**
