The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers (each less than `n`). For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. It then determines and returns the smallest integer `i` such that either `cnt[i] == 1` (indicating `i` appears exactly once in the list `a`) or `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2. If no such integer is found, the function returns the last integer `i` processed.
