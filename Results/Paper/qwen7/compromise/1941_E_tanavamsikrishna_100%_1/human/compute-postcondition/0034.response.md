Output State: **`i` is `2d + 3`, `min_heap` contains the tuple `(row[i], i)` where `i` is `2d + 3`, and each `row[i]` for `i` from `3` to `2d + 3` is updated to the original value plus `e[0] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code pushes a new element into the min heap. The element being pushed is a tuple containing `row[i]` and `i`. Since `i` is `2d + 3`, the tuple pushed into the min heap is `(row[2d + 3], 2d + 3)`. Additionally, each `row[i]` for `i` from `3` to `2d + 3` is updated to its original value plus `e[0] + 1`. The state of `min_heap` now includes the new tuple, and the values of `i` and `min_heap` are updated accordingly.
