Output State: **`i` is `2d + 3`, `min_heap` contains values where the minimum is less than or equal to `-2` and now includes `(e[0] + row[i-1] + 1, i)`, `row[i-1]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`.**

Explanation: The `pass` statement does nothing and does not affect any variables or the state of the program. Therefore, the values of `i`, `min_heap`, and `row[i-1]` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that `row[i-1]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i-1] + 1`, and this new value is added to the `min_heap` as `(e[0] + row[i-1] + 1, i)`.
