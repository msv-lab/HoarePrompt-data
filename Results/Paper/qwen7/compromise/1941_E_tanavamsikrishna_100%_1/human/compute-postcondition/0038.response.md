Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop condition is: `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is: `i` must be less than or equal to `d + 2`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop pops an element from `min_heap` and assigns it to `e`.
   - The condition checks if the second element of `e` (denoted as `[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Current State**:
   - `i` must be less than or equal to `d + 2`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must be true.
   - Since `i` is already set to be less than or equal to `d + 2`, the key factor here is the value of `[1]` from the popped element `e`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to ensure that the popped element `e` has a second element `[1]` that satisfies the condition when compared to `i - (d + 2)`.
   - Since `i` is fixed and must remain less than or equal to `d + 2`, the only way to ensure the loop continues is to ensure that the popped element `e` has a second element `[1]` that is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

### Conclusion
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i` to ensure that the loop can continue. However, since `i` is already constrained to be less than or equal to `d + 2`, we need to ensure that the popped element `e` has a second element `[1]` that fits the condition.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted such that the popped element `e` has a second element `[1]` that is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` must be less than or equal to `d + 2` and the second element `[1]` of the popped element `e` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`**.
