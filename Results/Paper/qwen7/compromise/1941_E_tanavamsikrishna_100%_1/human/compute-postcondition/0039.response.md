Output State: **`i` must be less than or equal to `d + 2` and the second element `[1]` of the popped element `e` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`**

Explanation: The `pass` statement in Python does nothing and simply acts as a placeholder. It does not modify any variables or change the state of the program in any way. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
