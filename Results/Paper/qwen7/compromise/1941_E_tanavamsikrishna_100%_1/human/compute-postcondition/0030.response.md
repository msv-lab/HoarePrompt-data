Output State: `i` is `2d + 3`, `min_heap` is empty, and each `row[i]` for `i` from `3` to `2d + 3` is updated to the sum of its original value plus `e[0] + 1` for each tuple popped from `min_heap`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. Given that the loop executed 3 times and the conditions specified, it implies that the loop will continue until there are no more elements in `min_heap` that satisfy the condition. After all iterations, `i` remains `2d + 3`, `min_heap` is empty, and each `row[i]` for `i` from `3` to `2d + 3` has been updated according to the rule described in the loop body.
