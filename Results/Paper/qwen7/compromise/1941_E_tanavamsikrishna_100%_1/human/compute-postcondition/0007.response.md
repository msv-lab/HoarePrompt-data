Output State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` plus the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs`; `rows` is unchanged, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values; `d` retains its original value; `costs` is unchanged; `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code appends to `total_costs` the sum of the slice of `costs` from index `i` (which is initially 1) to `i + k`. This means that `total_costs` now includes the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` plus the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs`. The other variables remain unchanged.
