Output State: **`total_costs` is now a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`; `rows` is unchanged, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values; `d` retains its original value; `costs` is unchanged; `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of the first `k` elements of the `costs` list to `total_costs`. Since `i` is initially 0, `costs[i:i + k]` refers to the first `k` elements of `costs`. The other variables and lists remain unchanged.
