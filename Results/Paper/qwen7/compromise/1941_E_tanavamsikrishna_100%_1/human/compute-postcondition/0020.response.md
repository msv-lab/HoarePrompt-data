Output State: **`i` is at least `2d + 2`, `min_heap` contains values where the minimum is less than or equal to `-2`, and `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**

This means that after executing the line of code `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`, the value of `i` remains at least `2d + 2` (unchanged from the initial state), the minimum value in `min_heap` remains less than or equal to `-2` (unchanged from the initial state), and the value of `row[i]` is updated to the sum of `e[0]`, the current value of `row[i]`, and `1`.
