Output State: `i` is `2d + 3`, `min_heap` is empty, and each `row[i]` for `i` from `3` to `2d + 3` is updated to the sum of its original value plus `e[0] + 1` for each tuple popped from `min_heap`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the second element of the tuple popped from `min_heap` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. After three iterations, the condition for the loop to continue no longer holds because the second element of the tuple is `d + 1`, which is no longer less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)` when `i` is `2d + 3`. Therefore, the loop terminates. During these iterations, the value of `i` remains constant at `2d + 3`, and the `min_heap` is emptied as each tuple is popped. Each `row[i]` is updated based on the value of `e[0]` from the tuples popped from `min_heap`, incremented by 1, and added to its original value.
