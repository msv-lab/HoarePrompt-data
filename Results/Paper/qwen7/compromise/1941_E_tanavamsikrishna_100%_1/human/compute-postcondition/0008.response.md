Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` plus the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs`.
   - `rows` is unchanged.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values.
   - `d` retains its original value.
   - `costs` is unchanged.
   - `i` is 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must still satisfy this condition.

5. **Final state**:
   - `total_costs` remains unchanged.
   - `rows` remains unchanged.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
   - `d` remains unchanged.
   - `costs` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` plus the sum of the next `k` elements of `costs`; `rows` is unchanged, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values; `d` retains its original value; `costs` is unchanged; `i` is 3**
