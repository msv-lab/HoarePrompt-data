Output State: `i` must be at least `2d + 2`, and the minimum value in `min_heap` must be less than or equal to `-2`.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be at least `2d + 2`, and the smallest value in the `min_heap` will be less than or equal to `-2`.
