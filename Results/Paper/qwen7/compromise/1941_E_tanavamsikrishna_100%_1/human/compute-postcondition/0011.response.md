Output State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every consecutive `k` elements of `costs` starting from the first element up to the second-to-last element of `costs`; `rows` is unchanged, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values; `d` retains its original value; `costs` is unchanged; `i` is now equal to `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `total_costs` will contain sums of all possible consecutive segments of length `k` within the `costs` list. The loop iterates from the start of `costs` to the point where a segment of length `k` can still fit within the list, hence the condition `range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`.
