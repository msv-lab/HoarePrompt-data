### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function starts by setting the first element of the row to 1.
   - It then increments the next `d-1` elements by 2.
   - This initial setup ensures that the first and last elements (which represent the river banks) are handled correctly, and the first few elements are set to ensure the minimum cost is covered.

2. **Min-Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap is initialized with the first `d` elements of the row.
   - This helps in keeping track of the minimum cost up to the current position.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop starts from index `d` and goes till the end of the row.
   - For each position `i`, it pops the smallest element from the min-heap.
   - If the popped element's index is less than `i - (d + 2)`, it means the distance constraint is violated, and the loop continues without updating the current element.
   - Otherwise, it updates the current element with the sum of the popped element and the current element plus 1.
   - The updated element and its index are pushed back into the min-heap.

4. **Heap Updates**:
   - The min-heap is updated to reflect the new cost of the current element.
   - This ensures that the heap always contains the minimum cost up to the current position.

Given the above steps, the function `func_1` correctly handles the placement of supports by ensuring the distance constraint is met and updates the costs accordingly.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function reads the dimensions of the grid (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) and the depths of the river cells (`rows`).

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each row, it calls `func_1` to calculate the cost of placing supports.
   - These costs are stored in the `costs` list.

3. **Total Cost Calculation**:
   - It then calculates the sum of every consecutive `k` elements from the `costs` list.
   - These sums are stored in the `total_costs` list.

4. **Result Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from the `total_costs` list.

Given the above steps, the function `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost of placing supports for each row and finds the minimum total cost across all rows.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic for building bridges and calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports. The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does handle the placement of supports according to the given constraints and correctly calculates the minimum total cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
