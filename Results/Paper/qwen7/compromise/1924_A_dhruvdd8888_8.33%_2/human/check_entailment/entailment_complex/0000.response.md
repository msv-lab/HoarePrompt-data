Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
3. It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
4. It uses a set `win` to track the last `k` characters seen in `s` that are in `us`.
5. It iterates through the string `s` and updates `win` accordingly.
6. If `win` contains all `k` characters at least once within `n` sets, it prints "YES".
7. If not, it prints "NO" and constructs a string that is missing one of the required characters from `us`.

The logic in the program seems to correctly implement the problem statement. However, there are a few issues in the implementation:

- The function `func_1()` does not handle the case where `win` might not contain all `k` characters exactly `n` times.
- The logic for constructing and printing the missing string is flawed. It should construct a string of length `n` that is missing one of the required characters, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    if ps >= n:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
        # Construct a string of length n that is missing one of the required characters
        missing_char = us.difference(set(ans[-1] if ans else ''))
        if missing_char:
            missing_char = missing_char.pop()
            print(missing_char * n)
```

Given the above corrections, the original program's logic is mostly correct but needs these specific fixes. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
