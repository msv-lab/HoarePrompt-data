Output State: **The program prints 'YES'**

The code snippet provided is simply calling the `print` function with the string 'YES'. Since no other operations are performed on any variables before this print statement, the only action taken is printing 'YES' to the console. The return statement here is not returning a value but rather performing an action (printing). Therefore, the output state is that the program prints 'YES'.
