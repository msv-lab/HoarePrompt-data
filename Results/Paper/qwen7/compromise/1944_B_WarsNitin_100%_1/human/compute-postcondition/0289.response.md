Postcondition: `i` is within the range [1, n - 2]. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is equal to -2, a break has occurred from the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i]]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is equal to 0, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` contains the element `b[i]`.
