Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `i` is len(l) - 2, `q` is len(l) - 2, `t` is len(l) - 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `b` is a list containing the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, and `c` is sorted, `req` is `k`, `l` is a list with one element which is the smallest element from the first `n` elements of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[0])` appends the first element of the list `b` to the list `l`. Since `b` contains the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, the first element of `b` is the smallest element among the first `n` elements of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
