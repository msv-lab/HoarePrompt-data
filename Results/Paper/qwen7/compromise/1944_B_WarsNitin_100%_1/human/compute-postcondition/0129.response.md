Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is -len(l) - 3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is 0**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The values of `i`, `k` (which was already defined before), `ans1`, `ans2`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is -1, `k` is -len(l) - 3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and `q` is 0.
