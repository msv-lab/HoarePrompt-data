Output State: **`k` is 0, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is 2, `ans2` contains the element `c[3]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `c` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans2` now contains the element `c[2]`, which is equivalent to `c[1]` as per the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged.
