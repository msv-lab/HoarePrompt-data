Output State: **`k` is an integer; `ans1` has the element `l[i]` appended to it; `ans2` has the element `l[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(l[i])` appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans2`. The initial state of `k` and `ans1` remains unchanged. `ans1` already has the element `l[i]` appended to it, so it stays the same. Therefore, after executing the code, `ans2` also has the element `l[i]` appended to it.
