Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `k` equals `req`, `l` contains the elements as follows: if any two consecutive elements in `b` from index 1 to `n-2` are the same, then those elements are appended to `l` twice or once depending on their count, and `ans1` contains the repeated elements as described in the previous states.**

Explanation: The code `k = req` simply assigns the value of `req` to the variable `k`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `l`, or `ans1`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the updated value of `k`.
