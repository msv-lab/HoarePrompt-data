Output State: **`k` is an integer - 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `ans1` has the element `l[0]` appended to it; `ans2` has the element `l[0]` appended to it; `i` is 0.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `i`. The length of the list `l` remains unchanged.
