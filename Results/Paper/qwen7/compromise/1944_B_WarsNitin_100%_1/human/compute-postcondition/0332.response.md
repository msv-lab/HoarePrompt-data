Output State: **`k` is -2, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is 3, `ans2` contains the element `c[3]` and an additional element `c[3]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[3]` to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 3, `c[3]` is appended to `ans2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
