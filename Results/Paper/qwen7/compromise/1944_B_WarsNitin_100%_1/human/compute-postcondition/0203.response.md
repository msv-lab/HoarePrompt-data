Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` equals 0, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` appended, and the current value of `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 1, `c[i]` is `c[1]`. Therefore, `ans2` now contains the value of `c[1]` appended to its existing elements. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged.
