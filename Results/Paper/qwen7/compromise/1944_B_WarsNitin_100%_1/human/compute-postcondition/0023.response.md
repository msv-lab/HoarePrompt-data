Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the original value of `k` minus 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements sorted in ascending order, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, and `c` is sorted in ascending order; `ans1` is a list containing the element `b[n - 1]` appended, `ans2` is an empty list; `req` is equal to `k`; `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` if `b[0] == b[1]`, otherwise `l` is an empty list.**

The code `k -= 2` decrements the value of `k` by 2. Since the original value of `k` was not specified, we only know that now `k` is twice its original value minus 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
