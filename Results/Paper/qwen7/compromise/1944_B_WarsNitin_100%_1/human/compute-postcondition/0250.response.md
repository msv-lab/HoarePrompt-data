Based on the initial state provided:

- After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `len(l) - 1`.
- `k` will be 0.
- `ans1` will contain all elements from `l` starting from index 1 to `len(l) - 1`.

The `print(*ans1)` statement will print the elements of `ans1`, which are all elements from `l` starting from index 1 to `len(l) - 1`.

Output: **all elements from l starting from index 1 to len(l) - 1**
