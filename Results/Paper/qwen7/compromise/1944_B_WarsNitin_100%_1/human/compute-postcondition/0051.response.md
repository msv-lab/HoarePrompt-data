Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` equals 0, and `ans1` contains the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]` (since `ans1.append(b[i])` appends `b[2]` to `ans1`).**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, `n` is still greater than 2, `k` remains 0, and `ans1` now contains the element `b[2]` twice because the code appended `b[2]` to `ans1`.
