Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements sorted in ascending order, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements.**

Explanation: The code `b.sort()` sorts the sublist `b` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `b` now contains the first `n` elements of `a` sorted, while `c` still contains the remaining elements of `a`.
