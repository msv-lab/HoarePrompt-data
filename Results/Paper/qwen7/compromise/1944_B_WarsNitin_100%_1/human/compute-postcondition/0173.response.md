Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `k` is 0; `ans1` now contains the element `b[2]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans1` will now contain the element `b[2]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
