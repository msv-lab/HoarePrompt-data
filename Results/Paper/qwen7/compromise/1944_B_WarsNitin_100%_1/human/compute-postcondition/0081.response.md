Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, the current value of `k` is 0, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `ans2` contains the value of `c[i]` which is equal to the current value of `c[i - 1]` and `ans2` has appended this value.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
