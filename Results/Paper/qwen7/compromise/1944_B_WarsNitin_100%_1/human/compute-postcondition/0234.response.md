Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(l)`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(l)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of `l`
   - `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of `l`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `len(l)`. Given that `ans1` and `ans2` contain elements from `l`, it implies that `l` has at least 2 elements. Thus, `len(l)` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `len(l)` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

6. **Determine what `ans1` and `ans2` will contain in the next iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `ans1` will contain the element at index 1 of `l` (which is already known as `ans2`).
   - `ans2` will contain the element at index 2 of `l`.

However, since we are only asked to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `len(l)`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 2, `len(l)` must be at least 2**
