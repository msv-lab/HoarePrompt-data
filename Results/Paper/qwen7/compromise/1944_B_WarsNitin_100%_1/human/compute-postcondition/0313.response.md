Output State: **All elements in `ans1` are duplicates of each other, `k` is 0, and `l` is empty.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will reach `n-2`. Since the loop condition is `for i in range(1, n - 1)`, once `i` reaches `n-2`, the loop will terminate. During each iteration of the loop, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans1` is appended with two copies of `b[i]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `l` is appended with `b[i]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`. However, since the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n-2`, and given the conditions provided, `k` will eventually become 0 and `l` will remain empty. All elements added to `ans1` will be duplicates due to the condition where `b[i] == b[i - 1]` results in appending the same element twice.
