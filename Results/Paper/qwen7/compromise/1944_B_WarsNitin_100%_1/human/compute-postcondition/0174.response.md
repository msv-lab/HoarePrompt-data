Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and `k` is 0; `ans1` now contains the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, `ans1` will append `b[2]` to itself. Since `ans1` initially contained the element `b[2]`, after appending `b[2]` again, `ans1` now contains the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
