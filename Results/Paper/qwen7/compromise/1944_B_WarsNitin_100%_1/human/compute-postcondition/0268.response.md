Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `i` is len(l) - 2, `q` is len(l) - 2, `t` is len(l) - 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `b` is a list containing the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, `c` is sorted, `req` is `k`, `l` is a list with one element which is the smallest element from the first `n` elements of `a`, `ans1` now contains the second last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends the second last element of list `b` to `ans1`. Since `b` is a list containing the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, and assuming `n > 1`, `ans1` now contains the second last element of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
