Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `k` equals 0
   - `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` appended

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in the range `1` to `n`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop runs until `i < n`, the next value of `i` would be `2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Considering the Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is set to -2.
   - Since `i` was 1 in the previous iteration, the condition `c[1] == c[0]` would determine the value of `k`.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `k` could either remain 0 or be set to -2 depending on the value of `c[2]` compared to `c[1]`.
   - `ans2` will contain the value of `c[1]` appended (unchanged).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `i` should be 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.
- `k` could be either 0 or -2.
- `ans2` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or -2, and `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` appended**.
