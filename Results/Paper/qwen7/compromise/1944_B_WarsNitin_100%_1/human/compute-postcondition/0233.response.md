Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of `l`**.

The value of `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was (but originally set to the same as `i`, which was 2) to 1. However, since no variable directly named `k` is mentioned in the initial state and the operation does not affect `ans1` or `ans2`, their values remain unchanged. The only change is to `i`, which is now 1.
