Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `k` is -2, `ans2` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `c[1]` to `c[n-2]` twice each and the element `l[n-1]` and `l[i]`, `ans1` now includes the elements `l[n-1]` and `l[i]`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` was initially `-1`, and the code decrements `k` by 1, making `k` equal to `-2`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
