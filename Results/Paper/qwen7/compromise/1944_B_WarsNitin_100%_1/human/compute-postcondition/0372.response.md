Output State: **All elements in `ans1` and `ans2` are duplicates of the elements in `l`. `i` is `len(l)`. `k` is 0.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be 0 because it is decremented until it reaches 0. The variable `i` will be equal to `len(l)` since the loop continues to append elements from `l` to `ans1` and `ans2` until `k` is 0. Both `ans1` and `ans2` will contain all elements from `l` as duplicates, as the loop appends each element in `l` twice to both lists.
