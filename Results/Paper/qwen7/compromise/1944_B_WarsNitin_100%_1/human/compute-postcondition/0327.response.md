Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `k` is -2
   - `req` remains the same
   - `ans1` contains duplicate elements
   - `l` is empty
   - `i` is 2
   - `ans2` contains the element `c[3]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 3.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop body, so it remains the same.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `k` remains -2
   - `req` remains the same
   - `ans1` contains duplicate elements (no change expected)
   - `l` remains empty (no change expected)
   - `i` becomes 3
   - `ans2` contains the element `c[3]` (no change expected)

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`k` is -2, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is 3, and `ans2` contains the element `c[3]`**
