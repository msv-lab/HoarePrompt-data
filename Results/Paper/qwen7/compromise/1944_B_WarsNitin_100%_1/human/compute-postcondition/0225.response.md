Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `k` is 0, and `ans2` contains a list of all consecutive duplicate elements found in `c` starting from index 1 to `n-1`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `k` will be 0 because once `k` reaches 0, the loop breaks, and since we are iterating through all possible values of `i` without `k` being reset to a positive value, `k` will stay at 0. The list `ans2` will contain all elements from `c` that are consecutive duplicates, starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, as the loop appends each duplicate pair to `ans2` when it finds them.
