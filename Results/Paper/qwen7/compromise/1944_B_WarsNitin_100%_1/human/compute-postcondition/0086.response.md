Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `k` is either -2 or 0 depending on the condition `c[2] == c[1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that we exit the current context (which could be a loop or an if-else statement). The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
