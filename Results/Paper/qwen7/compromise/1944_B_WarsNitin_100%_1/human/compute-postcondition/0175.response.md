Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, and `ans1` now contains the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to -2. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `ans1` still contains the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`.
