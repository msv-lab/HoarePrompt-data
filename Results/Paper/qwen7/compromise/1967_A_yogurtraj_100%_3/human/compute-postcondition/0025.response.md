Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is decreased by 1, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there are no loops or conditionals explicitly mentioned in the code snippet, the `break` statement is likely part of an implicit loop or conditional structure that was not shown. The variables `i`, `n`, `k`, `rem`, and `y` retain their initial or last known values before the `break` statement is executed.
