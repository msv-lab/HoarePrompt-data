Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `k` is adjusted based on the value of `i`, and other variables are set as follows: if `i` is 2, then `r` is `a[2] + 0 // 3`, `rem` is `0 % 3`, and `y` is `n - 1 - 2`. If the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is true, `k` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, `i` becomes 1, and `k` is decreased by `(2 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`, while `r` is set to `a[2]`.
