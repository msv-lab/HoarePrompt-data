Postcondition: `i` is 1, `k` is updated based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`. If the condition is true, then `k` remains unchanged and `r` is set to `a[0]` with `rem` being 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, then `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`, and `n` remains greater than 0.
