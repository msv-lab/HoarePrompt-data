Postcondition: **`ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is a value greater than or equal to 1, `k` is either 0 or has been reduced throughout the iterations, `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `r` is the last element of the list `a` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was never met, otherwise `r` is the element at the position where the condition was last met, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.**
