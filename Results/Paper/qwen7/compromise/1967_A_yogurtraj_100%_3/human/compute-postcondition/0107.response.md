Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, `n` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i + 1]` refers to `a[2]`. The values of `k` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
