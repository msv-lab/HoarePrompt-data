Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `i` is either 0 or 1.
- `n` is decreased by 1.
- `k` is adjusted based on the condition.
- `r` is updated accordingly.
- `rem` and `y` are defined as specified in the if part.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - If `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 1 in the next iteration.
   - If `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will terminate because the range is `range(0, n - 1)`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is decreased by 1 at the end of each iteration.

3. **Variable `k`:**
   - The value of `k` is adjusted based on the condition inside the loop.
   - If `i` is 0, `k` is updated according to the if condition.
   - If `i` is 1, `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.

4. **Variables `r`, `rem`, and `y`:**
   - These variables are updated based on the if condition when `i` is 0.
   - They are not relevant for the next iteration if `i` is 1.

5. **Variable `a`:**
   - `a` is an array that is used in the calculations but is not modified within the loop.

### Adjusted States for Next Iteration
- If `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will become 1 in the next iteration.
- If `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will terminate.

Given these points, let's consider both cases:

#### Case 1: `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration
- `i` will be 1 in the next iteration.
- `n` will be decreased by 1.
- `k` will be updated based on the if condition.
- `r`, `rem`, and `y` will be updated if the if condition is true.

#### Case 2: `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration
- The loop will terminate, and no further adjustments are needed for `i`.

Since we need to provide the state for the start of the next iteration, we assume `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration (as per the loop definition).

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is decreased by 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `r` is updated accordingly, and `rem` and `y` are defined as specified in the if part.**

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
```
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is decreased by 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition, `r` is updated accordingly, and `rem` and `y` are defined as specified in the if part.**
