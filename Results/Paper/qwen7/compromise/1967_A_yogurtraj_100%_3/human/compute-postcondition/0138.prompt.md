Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of cards of each type initially.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All elements in the list `a` have been processed, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of the original list `a`, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 1. If `k` is not 0, then `r` is updated to the last element of the original list `a` plus `k` divided by `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is a value greater than or equal to 1, `k` is either 0 or has been reduced throughout the iterations, `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n` if `k` is not 0, otherwise `r` is the last element of the list `a` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` was never met, otherwise `r` is the element at the position where the condition was last met, `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n` or `a[n-1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 1, `ii` is 1. If `k` is not 0, then `r` is updated to `a[n-1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `r` remains `a[n-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
