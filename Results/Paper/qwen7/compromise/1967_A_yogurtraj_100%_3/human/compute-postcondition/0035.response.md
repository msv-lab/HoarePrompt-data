Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2; `r` is 0; `rem` is 0; `y` is `n - 1 - i`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or their values altered within the given code snippet, the values of `i`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
