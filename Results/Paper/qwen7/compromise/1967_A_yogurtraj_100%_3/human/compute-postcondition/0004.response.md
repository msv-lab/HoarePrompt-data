Output State: **`r` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `n` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is an integer input from the user split by space and converted to an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

The code assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `r`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
