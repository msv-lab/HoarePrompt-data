Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(0, n - 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ii` is 0
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `k` is either reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` or remains as 0
   - `r` is either `a[0]` or `a[i + 1]`
   - `rem` is 0
   - `y` is 0

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `ii` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is updated to 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `k` may change based on the loop body, but we cannot determine its exact value without the loop body.
   - `r` may change based on the loop body, but we cannot determine its exact value without the loop body.
   - `rem` remains 0 as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `y` remains 0 as it is not part of the loop head.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is either reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` or remains as 0, `r` is either `a[0]` or `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0**
