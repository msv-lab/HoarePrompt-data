Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: The program reads three integers for each test case and stores them in a list `v`. This is done correctly using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Checking for Odd Sum**: The program checks if the sum of the three integers (`v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`) is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`, which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through any combination of game outcomes (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points distributed between two players).

4. **Calculating Maximum Draws**: For the cases where the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`. This formula is derived from the fact that each draw gives 1 point to each player, and the difference in points among the players must be accounted for. This calculation is correct.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the calculated result for each test case, which matches the expected behavior.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or return `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

Correctness: **True**
