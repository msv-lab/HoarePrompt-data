Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 500.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, the new value of `t` is an integer input from the user within this range. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
