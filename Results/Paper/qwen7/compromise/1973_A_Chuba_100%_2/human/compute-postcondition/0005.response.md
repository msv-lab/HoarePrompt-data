Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of the three integers is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\). If the sum is even, it calculates a specific value based on the integers and prints it. The function reads the number of test cases from the input, processes each test case according to the described logic, and outputs the results for each test case.**
