Output State: **`cur` is the original value of `cur` plus \(2^{(ASCII(ss) - ASCII('a'))}\), `cnt` is the current value of `cnt` plus 2, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, and `cur_ss` is assigned the value `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**.

In natural language: The value of `cur` remains unchanged from its original value plus \(2^{(ASCII(ss) - ASCII('a'))}\). The value of `cnt` is now its original value plus 2. The value of `cur_ss` is updated to be the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`. Additionally, `cur_ss` is explicitly assigned the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
