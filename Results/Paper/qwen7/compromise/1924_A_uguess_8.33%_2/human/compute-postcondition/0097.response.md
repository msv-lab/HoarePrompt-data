Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string where all characters have been processed.
- `cur` is reset to 0.
- `cnt` is the total number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\).
- `i` is set to \(k-1\).
- The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
