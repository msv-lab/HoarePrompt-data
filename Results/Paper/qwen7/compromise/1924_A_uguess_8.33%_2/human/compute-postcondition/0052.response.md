Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < k`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `cur` is an integer where the bit at position 1 is not set
   - `tmp` is 'b'

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < k`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `k` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
   - The postcondition states that if the bit at position `i` in `cur` is not set, then `tmp` remains 'b'. Since the bit at position 1 was not set, and `i` is now 2, we need to check the bit at position 2 in `cur`.
   - If the bit at position 2 in `cur` is not set, then `tmp` remains 'b'. Otherwise, `tmp` could change.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `k` remains the same (we don't know its exact value, but it doesn't change).
   - `cur` remains the same (we don't know its exact value, but it doesn't change).
   - `tmp` remains 'b' if the bit at position 2 in `cur` is not set; otherwise, it could change.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is the same as before, `cur` is the same as before, `tmp` is 'b' if the bit at position 2 in `cur` is not set, otherwise `tmp` could change**. 

Since we cannot determine the exact value of `k` or `cur`, we focus on the variables that change or are directly affected by the loop head.

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is the same as before, `cur` is the same as before, `tmp` is 'b' if the bit at position 2 in `cur` is not set**.
