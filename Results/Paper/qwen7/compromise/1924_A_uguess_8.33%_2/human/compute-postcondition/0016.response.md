Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is `cnt` + 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `cur` to 0, which overrides its previous value of \(2^{k+1} - 1\) shifted left by `cur_ss`. The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `cnt` is not specified in the initial state, so it is represented as `cnt` + 1.
