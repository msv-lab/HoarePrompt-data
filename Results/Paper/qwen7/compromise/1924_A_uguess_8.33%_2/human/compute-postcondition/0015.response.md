Output State: **`cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, and the value of `cur` is equal to \(2^{k+1} - 1\), `cnt` is `cnt` + 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. The value of `cur` remains as the original value of `cur` plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, and since `cur` was originally equal to \(2^k - 1\), after the shift left operation, it becomes \(2^{k+1} - 1\). The other variables remain unchanged.
