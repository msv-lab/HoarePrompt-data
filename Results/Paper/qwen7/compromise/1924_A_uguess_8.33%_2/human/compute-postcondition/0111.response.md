Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(k)`. The only variable being modified within this loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is \(k\)
   - `cur` is an integer where the bit at position \(k-1\) remains not set
   - `tmp` is the ASCII character corresponding to `ord('a') + i - 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < k`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was \(k\) at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to \(k+1\) at the start of the next iteration.
   - The value of `cur` and `tmp` will remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values depend on the initial conditions and the loop body (which is omitted).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is \(k+1\)
- `cur` remains an integer where the bit at position \(k-1\) remains not set
- `tmp` remains the ASCII character corresponding to `ord('a') + i - 1`

So, the updated state is:
State: **`i` is \(k+1\), `cur` is an integer where the bit at position \(k-1\) remains not set, and `tmp` is the ASCII character corresponding to `ord('a') + i - 1`**
