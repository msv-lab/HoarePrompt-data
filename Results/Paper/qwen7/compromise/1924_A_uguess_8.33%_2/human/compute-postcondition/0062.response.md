Output State: **`i` is \(k-1\), `t` must be greater than \(k-1\), `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still \(k-1\) and `t` must still be greater than \(k-1\). The new variables `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input.
