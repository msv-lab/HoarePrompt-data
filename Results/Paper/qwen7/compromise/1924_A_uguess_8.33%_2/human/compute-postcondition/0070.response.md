Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string; `cur` is `cur + 1 << cur_ss`; the condition `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` evaluates to `True`.**

Explanation: Initially, `cur` is such that when `1 << cur_ss` is bitwise ANDed with `cur`, the result is `False`. The code increments `cur` by `1 << cur_ss`. This means `cur` now equals its original value plus `1 << cur_ss`. Since `1 << cur_ss` was part of the original condition and now added to `cur`, the new condition `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` will evaluate to `True`.
