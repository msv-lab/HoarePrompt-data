Postcondition: `ss` is the first character of `s`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is \((1 << k) - 1\), `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`, and if the current value of `cur` does not satisfy \((cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0)\), the postcondition remains as described in the if part.
