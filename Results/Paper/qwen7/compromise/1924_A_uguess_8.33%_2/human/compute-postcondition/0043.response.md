Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which ranges from `0` to `k-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be `0`.

3. **Consider Other Variables**: The other variables mentioned in the problem statement are `ans`, `cnt`, and `tmp`. However, these variables are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

4. **Adjust the State**: The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`. Therefore, we need to set `i` to `0`.

Based on this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0**
