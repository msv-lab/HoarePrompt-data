Output State: **`i` is \(k+1\), `cur` is an integer where the bit at position \(k-1\) remains not set, and `tmp` is 'a' + \(i - 1\)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `tmp` to be the character corresponding to `ord('a') + i - 1`. Since `i` is \(k+1\), `tmp` becomes 'a' + \(k\). However, since the value of `i` itself is not changed, `i` remains \(k+1\). The value of `cur` is not affected by this operation, so it remains an integer where the bit at position \(k-1\) remains not set.
