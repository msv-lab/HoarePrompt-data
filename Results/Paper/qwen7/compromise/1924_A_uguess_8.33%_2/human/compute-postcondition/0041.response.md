Output State: **All characters in the string `s` have been processed, and `cur` is reset to 0; `cnt` is incremented by the number of times `cur` reached \((1 << k) - 1\); the count `cnt` is less than `n`; `tmp` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = ''` initializes an empty string `tmp`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `cur`, `cnt`, or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the previous conditions for these variables while including the new state of `tmp`.
