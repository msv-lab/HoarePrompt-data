Output State: **`ss` is the first character of `s`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is `ord(ss) - ord('a') + 1 << cur_ss`, `tmp` is an empty string, `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`, `s` is the input string, and the current value of `cur` satisfies that `(cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0)`**.

Explanation: The line `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by shifting `1` left by `cur_ss` positions and adding it to `cur`. Since `cur` was previously `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, the new value of `cur` becomes `ord(ss) - ord('a') + 1 << cur_ss`. All other variables remain unchanged.
