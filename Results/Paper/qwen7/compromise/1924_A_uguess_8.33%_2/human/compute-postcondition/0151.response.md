Postcondition: `ss` is the third character of `s`, `cnt` is 2, `i` is \(2k-1\), `cur` is `ord(ss) - ord('a') + (1 << ord(ss) - ord('a'))`, `tmp` is an empty string, and `ans` is `'a' * (n - 1)` followed by `tmp`.

Explanation: If the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is true, then `cur` is updated to `ord(ss) - ord('a') + (1 << ord(ss) - ord('a'))`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as specified in the if part.
