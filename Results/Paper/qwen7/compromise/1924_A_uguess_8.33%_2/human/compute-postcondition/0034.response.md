Postcondition: `cur` is the original value of `cur` plus \(2^{(ASCII(ss) - ASCII('a'))}\), `cnt` is the current value of `cnt` plus 2, and `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`. If the bit at position `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0, then `cur` is incremented by \(2^{cur_ss}\). Otherwise, if `cur` equals \((1 << k) - 1\), `cur` is reset to 0, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `cur_ss` remains unchanged.
