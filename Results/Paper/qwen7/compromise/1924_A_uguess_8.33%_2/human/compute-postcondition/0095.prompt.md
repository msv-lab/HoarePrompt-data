Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is 0, `i` is \(k-1\), `t` must be greater than \(k-1\), `n`, `k`, and `m` are integers obtained from input, `s` is the string input by the user, `cnt` is 0
Code of the loop:
for ss in s:
    cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
    if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
        cur += 1 << cur_ss
    if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
        cnt += 1
        cur = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a non-empty string, and `cur` is incremented by 1 shifted left by `cur_ss` if the condition `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` evaluates to `False`. If the condition evaluates to `True`, `cur` remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition only considers the if part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, and `cur` remains unchanged as it is set to `(1 << k) - 1` in the if condition, meaning all bits up to the `k`-th bit are set. If the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` (where `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a') is already set in `cur`, `cur` remains unchanged. If not, `cur` remains unchanged as well since the if condition always evaluates to true and the update operation does not occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the character `ss` converted from its ASCII value minus the ASCII value of 'a', `cnt` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
