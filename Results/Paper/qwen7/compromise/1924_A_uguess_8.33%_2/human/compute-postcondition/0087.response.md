Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a non-empty string.
   - `ss` is the next character in the string `s`.
   - `cur` is set to `(1 << k) - 1`, meaning all bits up to the `k`-th bit are set.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for ss in s:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `ss` in the string `s`.
   - The key part of the loop body is the if condition:
     ```python
     if (cur & (1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a')))):
         cur &= ~(1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a')))
     ```
   - This condition checks if the bit corresponding to the character `ss` (where `ss` is converted to its ASCII value and then subtracted by the ASCII value of 'a') is set in `cur`.
   - If the bit is set, it is cleared (`cur &= ~(1 << (ord(ss) - ord('a')))`).
   - If the bit is not set, nothing changes (`cur` remains unchanged).

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - After the loop completes one iteration, `ss` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - The variable `cur` will remain unchanged because the if condition always evaluates to true and the update operation does not occur based on the given postcondition.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `s` remains the same (non-empty string).
   - `ss` is now the next character in the string `s` (after the previous iteration).
   - `cur` remains unchanged as described above.

Therefore, the state adjustments for the next iteration are:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, and `cur` remains unchanged as it is set to `(1 << k) - 1` in the if condition.**
