Output State: **`i` is \(k\), `cur` is an integer where the bit at position \(k-1\) is not set, `tmp` is the ASCII character corresponding to `ord('a') + i - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `tmp` to be the ASCII character corresponding to `ord('a') + i - 1`. Since `i` is initially \(k\), `tmp` now becomes the ASCII character corresponding to `ord('a') + k - 1`. The values of `i` and `cur` remain unchanged.
