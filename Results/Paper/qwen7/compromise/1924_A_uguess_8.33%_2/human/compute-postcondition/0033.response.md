Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` is the current value of `cnt` plus 1, and `cur_ss` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cur` to 0. Since `cur` was previously set to the original value of `cur` plus \(2^{(ASCII(ss) - ASCII('a'))}\), and now it is reset to 0, the only change is that `cur` is now 0. The value of `cnt` is updated to its current value plus 1, and `cur_ss` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
