Postcondition: `ss` is the last character of `s`, `cnt` is the total number of characters in `s`, `i` is 0, `cur` is 0, `tmp` is 'a', and `ans` is a string of length `cnt` where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`. Since the else part is not provided and the if condition does not change the variables `ss`, `cnt`, `i`, `cur`, `tmp`, and `ans`, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
