Postcondition: `cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1 shifted left by `cur_ss`, `cnt` is the current value of `cnt`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a', and `ss` is the next element in `s`. If `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`, then `cur` is now the original value of `cur` plus 2 raised to the power of `cur_ss`.
