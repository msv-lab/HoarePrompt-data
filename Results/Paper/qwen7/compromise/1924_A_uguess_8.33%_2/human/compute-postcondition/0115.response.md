Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `2k-1`, `cur` is an integer where none of the bits from position `0` to `k-1` are set (i.e., `cur` is `0`), `tmp` is an empty string, `cnt` is `0`, and `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `0` times, which is an empty string.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have incremented to `2k-1`, `cur` will be `0` as it has gone through all bits from `0` to `k-1` without setting any of them, `tmp` will be an empty string since no character was appended to it, `cnt` will remain `0` because `cur` never reached \((1 << k) - 1\), and `ans` will also be an empty string as it was initialized to repeat a character `0` times.
