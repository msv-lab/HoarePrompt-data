You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the final output state depends on the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and the string `s`. Here's a detailed description:
    #
    #- `t` is the initial input integer, representing the number of test cases.
    #- After processing all test cases, for each test case:
    #  - `n` is the number of times the pattern needs to appear.
    #  - `k` is the length of the pattern.
    #  - `m` is not used in the provided code and can be ignored.
    #  - `s` is the input string that was processed.
    #  - `cnt` is the count of times the pattern `(1 << k) - 1` was fully formed in the string `s`.
    #  - `cur` is the current bitmask value, which tracks the characters seen so far.
    #  - `tmp` is a temporary string used to store the last incomplete pattern.
    #  - `ans` is the final answer string, constructed based on whether `cnt` meets or exceeds `n`.
    #
    #If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO' followed by a string `ans` constructed as follows:
    #- A string of length `cnt` where each character is `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`.
    #- Followed by `tmp`, which is either an empty string or 'a' + `2k-1`.
    #- Followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times if `cnt` is less than `n`.
    #- Or 'a' repeated `n - 1` times followed by `tmp` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.
    #
    #The final output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' answers followed by the corresponding `ans` strings for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Instead, it checks if all combinations of the first `k` alphabets appear as subsequences in `s`.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

For the second test case (`2 2 3 abb`), the program will output `YES`, but the correct output should be `NO` because the string `aa` cannot be found as a subsequence in `abb`.

The program uses a bitmask approach to track the presence of each character in the current substring of `s`. However, this approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are checked correctly. It only checks if all combinations of the first `k` characters appear somewhere in the string `s`.

To fix this, the program needs to generate all possible strings of length `n` and check if they are subsequences of `s`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in sub)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        alphabet = ''.join(chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(k))
        all_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
        
        found = set()
        for sub in all_strings:
            if is_subsequence(s, sub):
                found.add(sub)
        
        if len(found) == len(all_strings):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            # Print a string that is not a subsequence
            for sub in all_strings:
                if sub not in found:
                    print(sub[:n])
                    break

func()
```

This corrected version generates all possible strings of length `n` and checks if they are subsequences of `s`. If all such strings are found, it prints `YES`; otherwise, it prints `NO` and a string that is not a subsequence.
