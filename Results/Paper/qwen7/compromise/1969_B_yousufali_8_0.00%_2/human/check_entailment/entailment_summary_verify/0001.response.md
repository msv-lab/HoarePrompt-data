### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve a sorted string.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process a single binary string and compute the minimum cost to sort it.
   - However, the function reads the input as a list of integers (`map(int, input().split())`), which is incorrect for a binary string.
   - The function should read a single binary string directly and then process it.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also be incorrect.

4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - The program should read a binary string and calculate the minimum cost to sort it using cyclic shifts.
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the binary string input and does not compute the minimum cost.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The provided function summary for `func_2` states that it processes a specified number of test cases and counts the number of '1's in each binary string.
   - This summary is misleading because it does not reflect the actual behavior of `func_1`, which is incorrect.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the longest prefix of 1s and the longest suffix of 0s.
   - The cost of sorting the string would be the sum of the lengths of these prefixes and suffixes.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the binary string input and instead processes a list of integers. Therefore, the function `func_1` and `func_2` do not solve the problem as intended.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
