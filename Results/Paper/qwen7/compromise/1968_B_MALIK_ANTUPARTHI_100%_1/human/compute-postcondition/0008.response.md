Output State: **`j` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`**.

Explanation: The variable `j` was initially set to 0, and `b` must be greater than 0. The code updates `k` to be the index of `d[j]` in the slice `e[k:]` plus 1 plus the original value of `k`. Since `d[j]` is equal to at least one element in the slice `e[k:]`, `k` is updated accordingly.
