Output State: **`j` is `j_current + 1`; `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`**

Explanation: The variable `j` is updated to `j_current + 1`. The variable `k` is assigned the value of `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`. Here, `d[j]` refers to the element in the list `d` at the index `j`, which is now `j_current + 1`. The exact value of `k` depends on the value of `e[k:].index(d[j])`, which finds the index of the element `d[j]` starting from index `k` in the list `e`, and then adds `1 + k` to it.
