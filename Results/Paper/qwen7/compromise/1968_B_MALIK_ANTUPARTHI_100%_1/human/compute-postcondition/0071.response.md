Output State: **`j` is 0, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is `j + 1`, `i` is `b`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Given that `j` is initially 0, `k` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
