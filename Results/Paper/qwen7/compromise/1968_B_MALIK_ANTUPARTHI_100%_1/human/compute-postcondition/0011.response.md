Output State: **`j` is 0, `b` is greater than 0, `k` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is initially set to `j + 1`, which means `k` is 1 since `j` is 0. The condition `either k is equal to c or j is equal to b - 1` is not affected by the `break` statement, but the `break` statement itself indicates that we exit the innermost loop or if statement. The values of `j`, `b`, and `k` remain unchanged, and we simply break out of the loop or if statement.
