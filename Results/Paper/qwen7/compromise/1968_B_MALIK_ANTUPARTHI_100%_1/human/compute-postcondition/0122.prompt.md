Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an integer obtained from input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    b, c = map(int, input().split())
    d = input()
    e = input()
    k = 0
    for j in range(b):
        if d[j] in e[k:]:
            k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
            if k == c or j == b - 1:
                k = j + 1
                break
        else:
            k = j
            break
    print(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is equal to `b-1`, `b` is greater than 0, and `k` is either `c` (if `j` equals `b-1`) or `k` is set to `b` (if `k` does not equal `c` and `j` does not equal `b-1`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: j is 0, b is an input integer, c is an input integer, k is either c or 1, i is b, d is an input string, e is an input string, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: j is b, k is either k_final or j + 1, where k_final is the final value of k after the last successful search for d[j] in e[k:], and i is b + 1, and d is the same as the initial input string, and e is the same as the initial input string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
