Output State: **`j` is 0, `b` must be greater than 0, `i` is `b + 1`, `k` is `j + 1 + k`.**

Explanation: The code `k = j + 1` updates the value of `k` to be `j + 1`. Given that `j` is 0, `k` is now 1. The other variables (`b`, `i`, and the condition on `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
