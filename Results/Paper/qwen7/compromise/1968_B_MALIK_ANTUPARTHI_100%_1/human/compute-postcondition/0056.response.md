Output State: **`j` is equal to `b-1`, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `j`, `i` is `b`, `d` is an input string, `e` is an input string, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that we are exiting the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables.
