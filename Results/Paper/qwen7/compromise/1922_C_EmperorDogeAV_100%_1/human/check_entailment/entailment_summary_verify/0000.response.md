### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1` aims to identify the closest city for each city in the list. However, the logic within `func_1` is flawed. Here's what the function does:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    return prog_cities
```

1. **Initialization**: `back` and `forward` are initialized to extreme values.
2. **Distance Calculation**: For each city `i`, it checks the distance to the previous city (`back`) and the next city (`forward`).
3. **Assignment**: If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1. Otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference between the distances to the next and current city.

This logic does not correctly identify the closest city. Instead, it is trying to determine if the next city is closer than the previous city, which is not the intended logic. The intended logic should be to find the city with the smallest distance to the current city.

#### Main Program Analysis:
The main program uses the results from `func_1` to calculate prefix sums for forward and backward traversal. It then processes the queries based on these prefix sums. However, since `func_1` is not correctly identifying the closest city, the prefix sums will also be incorrect.

Given the example input:
```
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, due to the incorrect logic in `func_1`, the program will not produce these results. For instance, in the first query (from city 1 to city 4), the program should calculate the minimum cost to travel from city 1 to city 4 using the closest city rule, but it does not correctly implement this logic.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
