### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates a list `prog_cities` where each element is determined based on the distances to the next and previous cities.
   - For each index `i` from `0` to `n-2`, the function checks whether the distance to the next city (`forward`) is less than the distance to the previous city (`back`).
     - If true, `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1`.
     - Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i < n - 1`, or `0` if `i` is the last index (`n - 1`).

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the forward and backward differences using `func_1`.
   - It then uses prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) to quickly compute the minimum cost for traveling between any two cities.
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost involves checking whether the starting city index `a` is less than the ending city index `b` and using the appropriate prefix sum array.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound. The prefix sums allow efficient computation of the minimum cost by leveraging the precomputed distances.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the closest city for each city, ensuring the logic for determining the minimum cost is accurate.
   - The main program handles all constraints and edge cases appropriately, including the unique closest city condition.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
