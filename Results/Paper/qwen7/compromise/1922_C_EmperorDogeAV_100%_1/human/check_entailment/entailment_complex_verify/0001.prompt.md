You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, `back` will be `cities[n - 2]`, and `forward` will be `cities[n - 1]` if `n > 1`. For each index `i` from `0` to `n - 2`, `prog_cities[i]` will be set to `1` if the distance to the next city (`forward`) is less than the distance to the previous city (`back`). Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` will be set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i < n - 1`, or it will remain `0` if `i` is the last index (`n - 1`).
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is determined based on the conditions described. Specifically, for each index `i` from `0` to `n-2`:
    #
    #- If the distance to the next city (`forward`) is less than the distance to the previous city (`back`), then `prog_cities[i]` is set to `1`.
    #- Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` if `i < n - 1`, or it remains `0` if `i` is the last index (`n - 1`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of city coordinates `cities` and an integer `n` indicating the number of cities. It returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is set to `1` if the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the distances to the next and current city if the index is not the last one, or `0` if it is the last index.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves finding the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost can either be the direct distance between the cities or the cost to travel to the closest city plus the distance from the closest city to the destination.

2. **Key Components**:
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to compute an array where each element represents the cost to travel to the closest city.
   - The prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are used to quickly compute the cumulative costs for forward and backward travel.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing distances to the previous and next city.
   - However, the logic for setting `prog_cities[i]` is flawed. It should set `prog_cities[i]` to the index of the closest city, not the absolute distance.

4. **Issues with the Provided Code**:
   - The `func_1` function sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute distance to the closest city, but it should set it to the index of the closest city.
   - The `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` calculations are based on these incorrect values, leading to incorrect results.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify the closest city for each city.
   - Use the indices of these closest cities to compute the prefix sums.
   - Use the prefix sums to answer the queries efficiently.

Given the issues identified, the provided code is incorrect because it misidentifies the closest city and uses incorrect values for the prefix sums.

Correctness: **False**
