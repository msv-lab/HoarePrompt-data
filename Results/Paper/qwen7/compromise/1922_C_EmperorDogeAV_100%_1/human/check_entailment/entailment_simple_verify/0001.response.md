### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost can either be the direct distance between the cities or the cost to travel to the closest city plus the distance from the closest city to the destination.

2. **Key Components**:
   - The `func_1` function is intended to determine the closest city for each city.
   - The prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are used to efficiently compute the cumulative costs for forward and backward travel.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing distances to the previous and next city.
   - However, the logic for setting `prog_cities[i]` is flawed. It should set `prog_cities[i]` to the index of the closest city, not the absolute distance.

4. **Issues with the Provided Code**:
   - The `func_1` function sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute distance to the closest city, but it should set it to the index of the closest city.
   - The `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` calculations are based on these incorrect values, leading to incorrect results.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify the closest city for each city.
   - Use the indices of these closest cities to compute the prefix sums.
   - Use the prefix sums to answer the queries efficiently.

6. **Detailed Analysis of the Code**:
   - **`func_1` Function**:
     - The function correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing distances to the previous and next city.
     - However, the logic for setting `prog_cities[i]` is incorrect. Instead of setting `prog_cities[i]` to the index of the closest city, it sets it to the absolute distance to the closest city.
     - This leads to incorrect values being stored in `prog_cities`, which are then used to compute the prefix sums incorrectly.
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
     - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are computed based on the incorrect values in `prog_cities`.
     - These prefix sums are then used to answer the queries, leading to incorrect results.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code is incorrect because it misidentifies the closest city and uses incorrect values for the prefix sums.
   - The original assessment correctly identified these issues and concluded that the code is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the `func_1` function and the subsequent use of incorrect values in the prefix sum calculations.
