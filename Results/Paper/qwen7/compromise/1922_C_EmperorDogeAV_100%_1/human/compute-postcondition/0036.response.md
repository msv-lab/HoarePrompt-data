Output State: **`i` is either `k + 3` or `k + 2`, `n` remains the same, `back` is `-99999999999999999999`, `forward` is `999999999999999999`, and `prog_cities[i]` is `999999999999999999`.**

Explanation: The code sets `forward` to `999999999999999999`. Since `i` can be either `k + 3` or `k + 2`, `n` remains unchanged, `back` stays as `-99999999999999999999`, and `forward` is now explicitly set to `999999999999999999`. The value of `prog_cities[i]` is updated to match the new value of `forward` because it is defined as `abs(forward - cities[i])`, and since `forward` is now `999999999999999999`, `prog_cities[i]` also becomes `999999999999999999`.
