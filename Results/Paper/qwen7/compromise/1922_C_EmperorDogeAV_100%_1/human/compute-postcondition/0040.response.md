Output State: **`i` is either `k + 3` or `k + 2`, `n` remains the same, `back` is `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `forward` to `cities[i + 1]`. Since `i` is either `k + 3` or `k + 2`, `i + 1` will be `k + 4` or `k + 3`, respectively. The values of `n`, `back`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
