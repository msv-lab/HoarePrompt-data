Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same, `back` is `cities[i - 1]`, `forward` is `999999999999999999`, and `prog_cities[k + 1]` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `back` is assigned the value of `cities[i - 1]`. Since `i` is `k + 1`, `i - 1` becomes `k`. Therefore, `back` is now equal to `cities[k]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `forward`, and `prog_cities[k + 1]` remain unchanged.
