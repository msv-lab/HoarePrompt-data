Output State: **`i` is an integer, `back` is either -99999999999999999999 (if `i` is not greater than 0) or `cities[i - 1]` (if `i` is greater than 0), and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`, and `i` is less than `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `forward` to be `cities[i + 1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
