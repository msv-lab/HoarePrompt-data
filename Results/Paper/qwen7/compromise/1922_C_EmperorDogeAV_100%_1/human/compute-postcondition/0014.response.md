Output State: **`i` is an integer, `back` is either -99999999999999999999 (if `i` is not greater than 0) or `cities[i - 1]` (if `i` is greater than 0), `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`, and `prog_cities[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `prog_cities[i] = 1` sets the value of `prog_cities[i]` to 1. This does not affect the values of `i`, `back`, or `forward`. Therefore, the conditions for `back` and `forward` remain the same as in the initial state.
