Output State: **`i` is either `k + 3` or `k + 2`, `n` remains the same, `back` is `cities[i - 1]`, and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`. If `i` is not less than `n - 1`, the values of `i`, `n`, `back`, and `forward` remain unchanged; `prog_cities[i]` is now `abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])` if `i < n - 1`, otherwise `prog_cities[i]` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `prog_cities[i]` is updated to the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]` if `i` is less than `n - 1`. Otherwise, the value of `prog_cities[i]` remains the same as it was before. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `back`, and `forward`) retain their previous values as per the initial conditions.
