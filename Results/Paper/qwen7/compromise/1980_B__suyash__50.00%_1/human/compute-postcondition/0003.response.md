Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string from the user, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in `a.split()` to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, a.split()))` splits the string `a` into a list of substrings based on spaces, and then converts each substring to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `b`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
