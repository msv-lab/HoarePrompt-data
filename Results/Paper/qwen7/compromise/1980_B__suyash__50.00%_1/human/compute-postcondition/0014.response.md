Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string from the user, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in `a.split()` to an integer, `n` is the first element of the list `b`, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split(), `f` is the second element of the list `b`, `k` is the third element of the list `b`, `fav` is the element at index `f - 1` in the list `o`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `f - 1` in the list `o` to the variable `fav`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
