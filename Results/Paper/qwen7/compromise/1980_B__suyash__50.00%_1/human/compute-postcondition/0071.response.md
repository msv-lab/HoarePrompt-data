Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `l` must have at least one element.
- `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[1]]` and remains greater than or equal to 0.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string 'YES'. The values of `i`, `l`, and `k` are not relevant to this particular print statement since it does not reference them directly.

Output: **YES**
