Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is `k - dic[l[0]]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, it implies that the `break` statement is likely inside a loop or conditional that was not shown. However, the values of the variables `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `k` is still set to `k - dic[l[0]]`. The only effect of the `break` statement is to indicate that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in.
