Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is less than or equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that the program would exit the current loop or conditional structure it is within. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `k` is still less than or equal to 0.
