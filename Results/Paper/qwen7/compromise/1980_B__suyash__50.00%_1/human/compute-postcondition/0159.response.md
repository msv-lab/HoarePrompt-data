Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- The length of `l` is greater than 0 (though the value of `l` itself is not relevant to the print statement).
- `k` is `b[2]`, which means `k` is the third element in the list `b`.
- `fav` is `o[f - 1]`, meaning `fav` is the element at the position `f - 1` in the list `o`.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string `a` and converting each substring to an integer.
- `n` is the first element of the list `b`.
- `o` is a list of strings sorted in descending order.
- `f` is the second element of the list `b`.
- `dic` is a dictionary where keys are elements from list `o` and values are their counts in list `o`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will directly print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
