Output State: **`i` is 1, `l` must have at least one element, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[0]]` and remains greater than or equal to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional structure it was within. The values of `i`, `l`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states, except for the fact that we now know the execution has broken out of the loop or conditional block.
