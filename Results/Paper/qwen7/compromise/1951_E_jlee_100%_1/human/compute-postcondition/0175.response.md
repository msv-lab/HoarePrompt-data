Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `count` is 1, `count2` is 2**.

The code `count2 += 1` increments the value of `count2` by 1. Since `count2` was initially not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it was 0 before this line of code was executed. Therefore, after executing `count2 += 1`, the value of `count2` becomes 1 (0 + 1). All other variables (`j`, `n`, `done`, and `count`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
