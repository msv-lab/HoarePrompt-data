Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `done` is `True`.
   - `count` is 1.
   - `count2` remains unchanged (no explicit value given, so it retains its previous value).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
   ```

Given that `j` is 1, let's analyze the slicing operations in the print statement:
- `string[:j - 1]` translates to `string[:1 - 1]` which simplifies to `string[:0]`. This means it will return an empty string because it slices from the start up to but not including the 0th index.
- `string[j - 1:]` translates to `string[1 - 1:]` which simplifies to `string[0:]`. This means it will return the entire string starting from the 0th index to the end.

So, the print statement will output:
- An empty string followed by the entire string `string`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'', string**
