Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `count`, and `count` is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is a character.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `done` remains unchanged, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, then `done` becomes True.

Given these conditions, let's break down the print statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

1. `string[:j]`: This slice of the string `string` includes characters from the start up to but not including the character at index `j`.
2. `string[j:]`: This slice of the string `string` includes characters starting from index `j` to the end of the string.

Since `j` is `count` and `count` is greater than 0, both slices will be non-empty parts of the string `string`.

Therefore, the print statement will output two substrings of `string`.

Output: **string[:count], string[count:]**
