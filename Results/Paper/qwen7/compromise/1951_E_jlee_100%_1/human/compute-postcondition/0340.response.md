Output State: **`j` is count, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, `done` remains unchanged, `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
