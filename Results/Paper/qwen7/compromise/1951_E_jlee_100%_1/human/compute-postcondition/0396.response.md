Output: **string (where string is the first element of the list s)**

Explanation:
- `j` is initialized to 0.
- `n` is the length of the list `s`.
- `done` is `False`.
- The first element of `s` is not equal to the last element of `s`.

The print statement `print(string)` refers to the first element of the list `s`. Since no other information about the content of `s` is provided, we can only refer to the first element as `string`. Therefore, the output will be the first element of the list `s`.
