Postcondition: `j` is `count + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, and `count` is greater than 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, then no change is made to `done`.
