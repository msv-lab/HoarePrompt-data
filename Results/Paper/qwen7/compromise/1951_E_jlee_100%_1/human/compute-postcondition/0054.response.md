Output State: **`j` is 0; `n` is 1; `done` is False; `count` is 0; the character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` of `s`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the characters of `s` also remains the same.
