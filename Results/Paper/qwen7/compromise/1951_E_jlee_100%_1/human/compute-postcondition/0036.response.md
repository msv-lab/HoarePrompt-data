The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the conditions and values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is `False`, the first character of the list `s` (`x`) is not equal to the last element of the list `s`, `s.count(x)` is equal to 0, and the count of `x` in the list `s` is equal to `n - 1`. Additionally, the condition `(n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x)` is either true or false.**
