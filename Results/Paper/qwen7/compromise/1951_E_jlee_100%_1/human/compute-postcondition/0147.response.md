Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `count` is 1 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since there was no loop specified in the initial state, the statement is considered to be part of an implicit loop context. After executing `continue`, the values of `j`, `n`, `done`, and `count` remain unchanged, and the program proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.
