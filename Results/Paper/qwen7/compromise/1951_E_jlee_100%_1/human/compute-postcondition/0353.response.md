Postcondition: `j` is count, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, and `done` remains unchanged. If `count2` is less than `count`, then `done` becomes True. If `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, then `done` remains unchanged. If `count2` is less than `count` and `count` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count2` is set to 0.
