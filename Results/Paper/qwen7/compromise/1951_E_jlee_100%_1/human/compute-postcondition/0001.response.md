Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, the loop can start executing if `i` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters such that \(1 \leq |s| \leq 10^6\).

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 in the `range(t)` function, the initial value of `i` should be 0.
   - The value of `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `t` must be greater than 0

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
