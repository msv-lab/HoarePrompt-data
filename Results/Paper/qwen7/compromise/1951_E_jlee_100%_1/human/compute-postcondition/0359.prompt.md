Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `i` is 1, `t` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, and `count` is greater than 0. Either the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s` (in which case `count2` is either equal to `count` if `count > 1`, 0 if `count <= 1`, or greater than `count` and `done` is set to `True`), or the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to `x` (in which case `count2` is `count + 1`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, and `count` is greater than 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, then `done` becomes True. Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is count, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, and `done` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, then `done` becomes True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, then `done` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to `count` + 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
