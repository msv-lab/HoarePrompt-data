Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `done` is True
- `count` is 1

The print statement `print('YES')` directly outputs the string 'YES'. There is no need to evaluate any conditions or variables since the print statement itself does not depend on the values of `j`, `n`, `done`, or `count`.

Output: **YES**
