Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `done` is set to `True`.
   - `count` remains 0.
   - `count2` is greater than `count`, so `count2` must be at least 1.
   - The character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` of `s`. Since `j` is 0 and `n` is 1, this means the character at index 0 of `s` is not equal to the character at index 0 of `s` (since `n - 1 - j` is 0).
   - The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Since `j` is 0, this means the first character of `s` is not equal to `x`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.
   - Given `j` is 0, `string[:j]` will be an empty string because it slices from the start up to but not including index 0.
   - `string[j:]` will be the entire string `s` because it starts from index 0 and goes to the end.

Therefore, the print statement will output an empty string followed by the entire string `s`.

Output: **'', s**
