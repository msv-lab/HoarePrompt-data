Postcondition: **`j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, and `count` is greater than 0. Either the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s` (in which case `count2` is either equal to `count` if `count > 1`, 0 if `count <= 1`, or greater than `count` and `done` is set to `True`), or the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to `x` (in which case `count2` is `count + 1`).**
