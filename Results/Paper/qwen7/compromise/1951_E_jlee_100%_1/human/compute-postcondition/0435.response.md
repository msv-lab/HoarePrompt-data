Postcondition: **`j` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is `True`, `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and either `count2` is greater than `count` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `count2` is not greater than `count` and no action is taken.**
