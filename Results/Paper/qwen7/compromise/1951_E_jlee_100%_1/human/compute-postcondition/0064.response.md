Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is 1, `done` is set to True, `count` remains 0, `count2` is less than `count`, and the character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` of `s`. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The line `done = True` simply reassigns the variable `done` to the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, `count`, `count2`, and the condition regarding the characters in `s` remain unchanged.
