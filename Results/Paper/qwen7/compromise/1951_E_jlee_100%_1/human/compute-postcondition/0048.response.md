Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is 1, `done` is True, and the character at index `j` of string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` of string `s`.**

Explanation: The variable `done` is set to `True`, which changes its state from potentially being `False` or undefined to `True`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition about the characters in the string `s` also remains unchanged.
