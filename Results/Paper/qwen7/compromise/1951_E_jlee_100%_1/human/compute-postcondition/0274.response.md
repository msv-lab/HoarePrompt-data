Postcondition: `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, and either the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s` (in which case `count2` is either equal to `count` if `count > 1` and `count2 == count`, 0 if `count <= 1` and `count2 == count`, or greater than `count` if `count2 > count` and `done` is set to `True`), or the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to `x` (in which case `count2` is `count + 1`).
