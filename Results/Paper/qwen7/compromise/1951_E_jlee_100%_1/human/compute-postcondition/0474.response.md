Output State: **`done` is `True`, `count` is either 0 or 1.**

Explanation: The line `done = True` does not change the value of `done` from its initial state, which was already `True`. The values of `j`, `n`, and `count` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them. Therefore, the output state retains the same values for these variables as the initial state.
