Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is `True`, `count` is either 0 or 1, and `count2` is 0.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
