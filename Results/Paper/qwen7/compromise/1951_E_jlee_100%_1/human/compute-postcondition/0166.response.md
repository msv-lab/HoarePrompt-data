Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `done` is True
- `count` is 1

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1

Since `n` is 1, the string `string` must have only one character because `n` represents the length of the string. Let's denote this single character as `c`.

Now, let's evaluate the slicing operations:
- `string[:j]` will be `string[0:j]`, which is `string[0:1]`. Since `j` is 1, this slice includes the first character of the string, which is `c`.
- `string[j:]` will be `string[j:len(string)]`, which is `string[1:1]`. Since `n` is 1, the length of the string is 1, so this slice is empty.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **c, []**
