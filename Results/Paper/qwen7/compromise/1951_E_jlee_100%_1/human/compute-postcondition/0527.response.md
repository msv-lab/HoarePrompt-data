Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 2.
- `n` is the length of the list `s`.
- `done` is `True`.
- `count` is either 0 or 1.
- The condition `(not done)` is true.

However, the condition `(not done)` being true contradicts the fact that `done` is `True`. This means the condition `(not done)` should be false, but it is stated as true in the initial state. Given this contradiction, we will consider the condition as provided in the initial state for the purpose of answering the question.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will directly print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
