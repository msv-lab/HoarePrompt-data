Output State: **`j` is 0; `n` is the length of the list `s`; `done` is `True`; `count` is 0 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since there was no loop specified in the initial state, we assume this is within a loop context. The values of `j`, `n`, `done`, and `count` remain unchanged, and the loop continues.
