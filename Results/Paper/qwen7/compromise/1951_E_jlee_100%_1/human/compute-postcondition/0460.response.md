Output State: **`done` is `True`, `count` is either 0 or 1.**

The code `done = True` simply reassigns the value of `done` to `True`. Since the initial state already had `done` as `True`, this assignment does not change its value. The values of `j`, `n`, and `count` remain unchanged from their initial states.
