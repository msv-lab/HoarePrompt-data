Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `done` is True
- `count` is 0
- `count2` remains unchanged (but since it's not used in the print statement, its value does not affect the output)

The print statement is `print(string)`. Since `string` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value directly from the given information. Therefore, the output will be the literal text `string`.

Output: **string**
