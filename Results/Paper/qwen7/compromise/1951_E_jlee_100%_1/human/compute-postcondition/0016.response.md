Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is `False`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, and the current value of `x` is not equal to the last element of the list `s`.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if in a loop) and moves on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
