Output State: **`count2` is 0, `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to `x`, and `count2` is equal to `count`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
