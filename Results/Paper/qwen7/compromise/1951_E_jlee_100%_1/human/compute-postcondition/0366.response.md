Output State: **`j` is `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, `done` is unchanged, `count2` is either `count` (if `s[j]` equals `x`), or it remains as the last calculated value, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, `string` is an input string, and the condition `(not done)` is true.**

Explanation: The code `string = input()` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `string`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
