You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        s = list(string)
        n = len(s)
        done = False
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        x = s[0]
        if x != s[-1]:

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string can be split into two parts such that the first part is the reverse of the second part, or if the string can be made into a palindrome by removing at most one character. If such a condition is met, it prints "YES" along with the number of operations needed and the modified string; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function ensures that all possible conditions have been checked and outputs the final results accordingly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It handles the case where the string length is 1 by immediately printing 'NO' and continuing to the next test case.
   - It checks if the first character `x` is different from the last character. If so, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as the partition, which is correct because a single-character string is not a palindrome.

2. **Handling Single Character Repetition:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the program correctly prints 'NO', indicating no valid partition can be made.
   - If the string has a single unique character and the length is odd, it correctly prints 'NO' because the middle character would form a palindrome.

3. **Checking for Non-Palindromic Substrings:**
   - The program iterates through the string to find the first non-palindromic pair of characters.
   - If found, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as the partition, which is incorrect because we need to split the string into more than one part.
   - If no such pair is found, it attempts to split the string into two parts based on the first non-matching character, but this logic is flawed and incomplete.

4. **Flawed Logic for Partitioning:**
   - The logic for splitting the string into two parts based on the first non-matching character is incorrect. It does not guarantee that the resulting substrings will not be palindromes.
   - The program fails to handle cases where the string can be split into more than two parts without forming palindromes.

5. **Handling Remaining Cases:**
   - The program does not cover all possible cases where the string can be split into multiple non-palindromic parts. For example, it does not handle strings like "aab" or "abcde" correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the required logic to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings. It fails to handle various edge cases and does not guarantee a valid partition in all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
