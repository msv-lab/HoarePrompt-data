Output State: **`mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is now `mid`, and `l < h` must still hold true.**

Explanation: The line `h = mid` updates the value of `h` to the current value of `mid`. All other variables (`mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, and the condition `l < h`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
