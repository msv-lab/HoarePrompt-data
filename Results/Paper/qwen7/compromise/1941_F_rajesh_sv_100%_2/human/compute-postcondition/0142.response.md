Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It returns a value based on comparing three lists: A (a list of n strictly increasing integers), D (a list of unique integers after sorting), and F (a list of k integers). The function checks if the elements in list A match the elements in list D and list F according to the given constraints.**

Note: Since the specific operation to be performed on the lists is not detailed in the provided information, the functionality description focuses on the acceptance of the lists and the implied comparison or validation process.
