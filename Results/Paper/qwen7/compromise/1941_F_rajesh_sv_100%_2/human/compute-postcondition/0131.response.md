Output State: **`mid_sum` remains `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` remains `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `h` is now `mid`.**

Explanation: The variable `h` is assigned the value of `mid`. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state. The condition `l < h` still holds true.
