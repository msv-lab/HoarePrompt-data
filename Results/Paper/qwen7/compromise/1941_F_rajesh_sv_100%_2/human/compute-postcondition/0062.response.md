Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < h`.

2. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `l` and `h`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `l < h`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` remains unchanged and `h` may or may not have been updated based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `h` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid` and `f` remains unchanged.

5. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since `l` remains unchanged, no adjustment is needed for `l`.
   - We need to ensure that `h` is such that the condition `l < h` still holds true for the next iteration.

Given that `h` may or may not have been updated, but we need to ensure that `l < h` for the next iteration, we should consider the worst-case scenario where `h` could be updated to `mid` (which would make `h` equal to `mid`).

Therefore, we need to ensure that `h` is greater than `l` for the next iteration. This means `h` must be greater than `l` at the end of the current iteration.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `l` remains unchanged.
- `h` must be greater than `l`.

**Answer**:
State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` remains unchanged, `h` must be greater than `l`**
