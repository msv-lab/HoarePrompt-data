Output State: **`max_diff` holds the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A`, `next_max_diff` holds the second maximum difference found, `index` holds the index of the element where `max_diff` was found (or `None` if no valid `max_diff` was found), `i` is equal to `n`, `diff` is not defined, `left` is equal to `A[index - 1]`, `right` is equal to `A[index]`.**

This output state reflects that the variables `left` and `right` have been assigned the values of `A[index - 1]` and `A[index]` respectively, while all other variables remain in their previous states.
