Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < h`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must remain true.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
   - `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
   - `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`
   - `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`
   - `mid` is either `mid + 1` or `h` depending on whether `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition `l < h` depends on the values of `l` and `h`.
   - We need to ensure that `l` remains less than `h` for the loop to continue.

Given the current state, `l` and `h` are already defined based on the conditions provided. To ensure the loop continues, `l` should still be less than `h`.

Since the loop condition `l < h` is the only condition we need to maintain, no adjustments are necessary for `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, or any other variables outside the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `h` to ensure they remain in the condition `l < h`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`, and `l` must be less than `h`**.
