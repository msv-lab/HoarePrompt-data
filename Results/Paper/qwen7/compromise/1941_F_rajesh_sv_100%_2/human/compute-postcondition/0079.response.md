Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mid_sum` as the value of `D[mid]` plus `f`, and `mid_next_sum` as the value of `D[mid + 1]` plus `f`. The values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states.
