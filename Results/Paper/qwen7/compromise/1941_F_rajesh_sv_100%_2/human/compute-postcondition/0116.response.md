Postcondition: `f` is the next value in the list `F`, `l` is the index of the first element in list `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index obtained by subtracting 1 from the index where `right - f` would be inserted in list `D` using binary search, `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. Additionally, `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`.
