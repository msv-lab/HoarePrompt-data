To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition, which is `l < h`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `l < h`.
2. **Current States**: 
   - `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
   - `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
   - `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`
   - `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `l < h` must hold true.

Given the current states:
- `l` and `h` are already defined based on the conditions involving `left - f` and `right - f`.
- The loop body (which is omitted) might update `l` or `h` based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`.

For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `h`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l < h` holds true after the loop body executes.

Since the loop body updates either `l` or `h` based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, we need to ensure that the updated values of `l` and `h` still satisfy `l < h`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `h` to ensure they maintain the condition `l < h`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is the index of the smallest item in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, and `h` is the index of the largest item in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - f`, ensuring that `l < h`**.
