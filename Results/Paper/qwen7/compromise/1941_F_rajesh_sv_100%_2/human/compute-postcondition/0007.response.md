Output State: `testcases` is a positive integer minus the total number of iterations (i.e., `testcases - testcases`), and `func_6()` has been called `testcases` times.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all its iterations, `testcases` will be reduced to zero, and `func_6()` will have been called exactly `testcases` times.
