Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States:
- `f` is the next value in the list `F`.
- `l` is `mid + 1` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true, otherwise `l` remains the index of the first element in list `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`.
- `h` is adjusted to `mid` if the condition is false, otherwise `h` remains the same.
- `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.

### Loop Condition:
```
while l < h:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `l` and `h`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `l < h`.

Given the current state:
- `l` is determined based on the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`.
- `h` is adjusted based on the condition being true or false.
- `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` are recalculated but are not part of the loop head condition.

### Determining the Next State:

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `l < h` must hold true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` is still less than `h`.

#### Possible Scenarios:
1. **If the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true**:
   - `l` becomes `mid + 1`.
   - `h` remains unchanged.
   - For the loop to continue, `mid + 1 < h` must hold true.

2. **If the condition `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is false**:
   - `h` becomes `mid`.
   - `l` remains unchanged.
   - For the loop to continue, `l < mid` must hold true.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to guarantee that `l < h` holds true. This means we need to ensure that either `l` is less than `h` after the condition evaluation or that the values of `l` and `h` are such that the loop condition is satisfied.

### Final Answer:
State: **`f` is the next value in the list `F`, `l` is `mid + 1` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true, otherwise `l` remains the index of the first element in list `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`, `h` is adjusted to `mid` if the condition is false, otherwise `h` remains the same, `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `l < h` must hold true.**
