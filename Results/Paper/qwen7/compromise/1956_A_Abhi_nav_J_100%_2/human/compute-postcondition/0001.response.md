Output State: **The program returns a list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list 'a'**

This means that for each integer in the list `a`, the program subtracts 1 from it, and returns the new list with these adjusted values. Since the original list `a` contains integers such that \(1 \leq a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_k \leq 100\), the returned list will contain integers such that \(0 \leq (a_1 - 1) < (a_2 - 1) < \ldots < (a_k - 1) \leq 99\).
