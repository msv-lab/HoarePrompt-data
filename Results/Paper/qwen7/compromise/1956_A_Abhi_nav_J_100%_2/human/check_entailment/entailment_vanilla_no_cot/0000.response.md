Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is supposed to calculate the number of winners based on the initial number of players (`a`) and the number of players in the game (`b`). However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not follow the logic required by the problem.
   - Specifically, the function should simulate the rounds of the game and count the number of players who remain until no more players can be removed in a round.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Simulating Rounds**:
   - The program does not simulate the rounds of the game as described. It does not remove players according to the sequence `a` and check if any players are left after each round.

3. **Incorrect Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input but does not process it correctly to simulate the game rounds. It directly calls `func_1` without simulating the removal of players based on the sequence `a`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the rounds of the game and keep track of the remaining players. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def simulate_game(a, n):
    players = list(range(1, n + 1))
    while True:
        removed = []
        for index in a:
            if len(players) >= index:
                removed.append(players[index - 1])
                players.pop(index - 1)
            else:
                break
        if not removed:
            break
    return len(players)

n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    og = input().split()
    k = int(og[0])
    q = int(og[1])
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results = []
    for _ in range(q):
        n_players = int(input())
        results.append(simulate_game(a, n_players))
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))
```

This program correctly simulates the game rounds and counts the number of remaining players after each round, ensuring that the logic matches the problem description.
