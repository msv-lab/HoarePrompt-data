#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100, and b is a list of integers representing the sequence n_i where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns a list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list 'a'
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list 'b' which contains integers in the range of 1 to 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two lists of integers, `a` and `b`, as input. It returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in list `a`, unless any element in list `a` is 1, in which case it returns list `b`.
