The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of these variables.

Output State: **`x` is the new input integer, `n` is the new input integer divided by the old `x`, `k` is `x // n`.**
