Output State: **`i` is incremented by 2, `l` is updated to `[ans, ans]`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `l = [ans]` updates the list `l` to contain only the element `ans`. Since the initial state had `l` updated to `[max(l), i]`, and now `l` is updated to `[ans]`, it means that the current value of `l` is `[ans]`. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
