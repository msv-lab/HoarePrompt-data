Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `x` is an input integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`.
- `ans` is the maximum value found among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`.
- `i` is the last odd number checked before `x` (or `x` itself if it is odd).
- `x % 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether `x` is even.
- The loop runs through all odd numbers from the smallest possible (1 if `x` is even, otherwise 1) up to `x` (if `x` is odd) or `x - 1` (if `x` is even).
- `l` is not explicitly mentioned but is replaced by `ans`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the maximum value found among all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value found among all divisors of x that are less than or equal to k)**
