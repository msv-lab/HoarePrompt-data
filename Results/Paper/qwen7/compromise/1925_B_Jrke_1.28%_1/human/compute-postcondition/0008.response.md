Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and `ans` is 1.**

The code simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `ans`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
