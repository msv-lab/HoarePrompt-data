Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and `ans` is 1, `i` is 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), `x % 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether x is even, and the loop runs up to int(x). The current value of `i` is such that x is divisible by i.
