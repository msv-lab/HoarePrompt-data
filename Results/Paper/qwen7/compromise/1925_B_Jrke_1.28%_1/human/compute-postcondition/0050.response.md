Output State: **`x` is the new input integer, `n` is the new input integer divided by the old `x`, `k` is `x // n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x // n` to the variable `k`. Here, `x` is the new input integer, and `n` is the new input integer divided by the old `x`. The value of `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. All other variables retain their previous values.
