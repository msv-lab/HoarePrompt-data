Postcondition: **`x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1; `n` is defined and non-zero; `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[ans]`; `i` is the next even or odd number depending on the current value of `x`, and `l` contains the value `ans` and possibly the value of `i` appended to it.**
