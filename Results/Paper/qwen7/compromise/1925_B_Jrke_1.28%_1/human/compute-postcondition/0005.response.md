Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. The current value of `k` is 1, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
