Output State: **`x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1; `k` is `x // n`. We continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no variables are assigned new values or affected by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `x` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The loop continues as if the current iteration was skipped.
