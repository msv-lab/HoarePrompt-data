Postcondition: **`x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1; `n` is defined and non-zero; `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[ans, ans]`, which simplifies to `ans`; `i` is the next even or odd number depending on the current value of `x`, and `l` contains the value `ans` and the value of `x // i` appended to it.**
