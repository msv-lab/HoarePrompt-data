Postcondition: **`x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1; `n` is defined and non-zero; `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[ans, ans]`, which simplifies to `ans`; `i` is the next even or odd number depending on the current value of `x` plus 2; `l` contains the value `ans` and the value of `x // (i + 2)` appended to it, and if `i <= k`, `l` now has an additional element `i`.**
