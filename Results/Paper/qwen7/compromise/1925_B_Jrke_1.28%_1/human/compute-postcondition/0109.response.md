Postcondition: **`x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1; `n` is defined and non-zero; `ans` is 1; `l` is a list containing the values [1, i, x // i] where `i` is a variable that is less than or equal to `k`; if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1, and `l` is updated to include `x // i`; otherwise, `l` remains unchanged.**
