Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), `x % 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether x is even, the loop runs up to int(x / 2), `l` is a list containing the value 1 and `i`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is initially set to `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`, the list `l` now contains the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
