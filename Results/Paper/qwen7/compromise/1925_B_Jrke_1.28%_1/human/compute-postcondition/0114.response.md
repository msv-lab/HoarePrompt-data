Output State: **`x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1; `n` is defined and non-zero; `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[ans]`; `i` is the next even or odd number depending on the current value of `x`, `l` contains the value `ans`, and `i` is appended to `l`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `l` now contains the value of `ans` and also has `i` appended to it.
