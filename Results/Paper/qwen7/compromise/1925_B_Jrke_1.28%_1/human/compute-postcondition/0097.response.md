Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1.
   - `k` is defined as `x // n`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(1)
   ```

From the initial state, we know that `x` will be either 1 (if it doesn't have any factors greater than 1) or its smallest factor greater than 1. Regardless of the value of `x`, the `print(1)` statement will simply print the number 1.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **1**
