Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is 2 (since `ac += 1` increments `ac` by 1 from its original value which was either 1 or 0), `bc` is either 1 or 2, `s` is the original string minus the first character, `i` is the second character of the original string**.

The value of `ac` is incremented by 1, changing it from either 1 or 0 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
