You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and s is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list where each element `d[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) represents the balance of parentheses up to position `i` in `s`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is a string consisting of all characters from `s` at positions specified by the first element of each tuple in `d`. The positions are in ascending order based on the balance values of parentheses up to that position.
    return ans
    #The program returns a string consisting of characters from 's' at positions specified by the first element of each tuple in 'd', ordered by the ascending balance values of parentheses up to those positions.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation. Specifically, the program sorts the positions based on the prefix balance but does not consider the requirement to break ties in decreasing order of position. 

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The correct balanced shuffle should be `()(()())`, but the program incorrectly outputs `((())())` because it does not handle the tie-breaking rule properly. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Compute the prefix balances and store them in the dictionary `d`:
   ```
   Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7
   ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
   Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8
   Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )
   ```

2. The dictionary `d` will be:
   ```
   {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 2, 6: 2, 7: 3}
   ```

3. After removing the last entry and sorting by prefix balance, the dictionary becomes:
   ```
   [(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 2), (6, 2), (7, 3)]
   ```

4. The program then constructs the result by taking the characters from the original string at the sorted positions:
   ```
   ans = s[1] + s[2] + s[3] + s[4] + s[5] + s[6] + s[7]
   ans = ( + ( + ( + ( + ) + )
   ```

This results in `((())())`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `()(()())`. Therefore, the program fails to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation due to the lack of proper tie-breaking in the sorting step.
