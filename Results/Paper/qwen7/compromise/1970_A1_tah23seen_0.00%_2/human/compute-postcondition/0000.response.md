Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and `n` is the length of `s`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence, `n` will be a positive integer representing the number of characters in `s`. The content of `s` remains unchanged.
