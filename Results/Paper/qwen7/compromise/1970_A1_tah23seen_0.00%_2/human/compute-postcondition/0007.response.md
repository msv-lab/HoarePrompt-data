Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list where each element `d[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) represents the balance of parentheses up to position `i` in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `d.pop(n)` removes the last element from the list `d`. Since the original length of `d` was `n` (because `d[i]` went from 1 to `n`), after popping the `n`-th element, the list `d` now contains elements from `d[1]` to `d[n-1]`.
