Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `m-1` starting with the second character of the original `s`. If `len(alphabet) != 1`, `i` is no longer in `alphabet` and `alphabet` has been modified by removing `i`. Otherwise, `s2` is a string containing the character `i`, `s` is a string of length `m-1` starting with the second character of the original `s`, and `i` is the third character of the original `s`, `alphabet` is a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1'.**
