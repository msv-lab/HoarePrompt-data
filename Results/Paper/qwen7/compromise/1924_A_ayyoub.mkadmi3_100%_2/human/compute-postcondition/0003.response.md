Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the string `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `s`**:
   - `s1` is an empty string (not used in the loop).
   - `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`.
   - `s2` is an empty string (not used in the loop).
   - `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The loop will iterate over each character in `s`. Therefore, `i` will take on each value of the characters in `s` one by one.
   - For the loop to start executing, `s` must contain at least one character. Since `s` is a string of length `m`, and `m` is a positive integer, `s` must not be empty.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `s` and `i`.

- `s` must contain at least one character.
- `i` will start as the first character of `s`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must not be empty, `i` is the first character of `s`**.
