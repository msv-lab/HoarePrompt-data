Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must not be empty.
   - `i` is the first character of `s`.
   - `alphabet` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the conditions given, if `i` is in `alphabet`, then `s1` is the first character of `s` and `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`. Otherwise, no change occurs.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is still a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must not be empty.
   - `i` is now the second character of `s` (since it was the first character in the previous iteration).
   - `alphabet` remains unchanged.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the third character of `s`.
   - `s1` will be the first character of `s` (which is now the second character from the original `s`).
   - `s2` will be a string containing the first character of `s` (which is now the second character from the original `s`).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `s` should now be a string starting with its second character.
- `i` should be the third character of the original `s`.

So, the updated state is:

**State: **`s` is a string of length `m-1` starting with the second character of the original `s`, `i` is the third character of the original `s`, and `alphabet` remains unchanged.**
