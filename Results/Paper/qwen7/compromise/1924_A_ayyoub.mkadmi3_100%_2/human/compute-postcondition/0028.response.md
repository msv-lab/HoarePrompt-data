Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `m-2` starting with the third character of the original `s`, `i` is the fourth character of the original `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1' with `i` removed if `len(alphabet) != 1'. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s1` is the character `i`. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
