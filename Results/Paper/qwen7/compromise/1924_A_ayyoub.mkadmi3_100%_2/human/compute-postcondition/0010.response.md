Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and must not be empty. `i` is the first character of `s`. If `alphabet` contains `i`, then `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s` and `alphabet` remains unchanged. If `alphabet` does not contain `i`, then `alphabet` does not contain `i` and `s2` is a string containing the first character of `s`.**
