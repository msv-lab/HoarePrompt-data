Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. The array `a` is sorted, which is necessary to determine the median.
4. The code calculates the median index `mdx` correctly as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
5. However, the logic for calculating the minimum number of operations to increase the median is incorrect. The current implementation counts the number of elements equal to `a[mdx]` from `mdx` to the end of the array. This count is printed as the result, but it does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to compare the middle element `a[mdx]` with the next element `a[mdx + 1]` (if it exists). The number of operations required to increase the median would be the difference between the median and the next unique element, or the number of elements equal to the median if there are no elements greater than the median.

Given the current implementation, the solution will not always yield the correct minimum number of operations.

Correctness: **False**
