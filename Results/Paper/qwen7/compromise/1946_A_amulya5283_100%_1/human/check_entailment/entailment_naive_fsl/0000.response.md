Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the median needs to be strictly greater than the current median after the operations. Instead, it simply counts how many elements are equal to the median in the sorted array, which does not guarantee the minimum number of operations needed to strictly increase the median.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
4
7 3 3 1
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `2` because we can increase the first `3` to `4` and the second `3` to `4`, making the array `[4, 4, 3, 1]`. After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 3, 4, 4]`, and the median is `3.5`, which is greater than the original median `3`.

However, the program only counts the number of elements equal to the median, which is `2` in this case. This does not ensure that the median is strictly increased. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
