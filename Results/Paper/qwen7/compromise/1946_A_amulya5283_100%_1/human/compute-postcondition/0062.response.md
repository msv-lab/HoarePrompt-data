Output State: **`t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()), `res` is 0, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`**.

This means that the value of `mdx` is determined based on the value of `n`. Specifically, `mdx` is calculated as half of `n` rounded down, plus `n` modulo 2, then subtracting 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
