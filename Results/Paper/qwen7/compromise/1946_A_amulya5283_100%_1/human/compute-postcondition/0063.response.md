Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop runs from `mdx` to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - For the loop to start, `mdx` must be less than `n`.

3. **Calculate `mdx`**:
   - `mdx` is defined as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - This means `mdx` is the middle index of the list `a` if `n` is odd, or the index just before the middle if `n` is even.

4. **Ensure the loop can start**:
   - We need to ensure that `mdx < n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` is not directly related to the loop execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `n` is an input integer, but its value is already given and we need to ensure `mdx < n`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers, but we don't need to adjust its contents; we just need to ensure the length condition.
   - `res` is initialized to 0 and is not directly related to the loop execution.
   - `mdx` is derived from `n`, so we need to ensure `mdx < n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `mdx` such that `mdx < n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must satisfy `mdx < n`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()), `res` is 0, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`**
