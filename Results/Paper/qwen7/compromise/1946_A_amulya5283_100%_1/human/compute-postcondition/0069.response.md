Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variables `i` and `mdx`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `mdx` to `n`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is equal to `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer that must satisfy `mdx < n`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `res` is 1.
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - If `mdx` is equal to index `i`, then `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - `mdx` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Determine the New State:**
   - `t` will be `t - 1` (unchanged from the previous state).
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `res` remains 1.
   - `mdx` remains the same.
   - `i` will be `mdx` (from the previous state) + 1.

Given these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must satisfy `mdx < n`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is 1, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `i` is `mdx + 1`.**
