Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and the array a contains n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        res = 0
        mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
        for i in range(mdx, n):
            if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                res += 1
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and if `n` equals 1, then no changes are made. Otherwise, `res` is 3, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and the middle index `mdx` of the list `a` has the same value as the last index `i` that was checked during the loop, with `res` incremented each time `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string. If `n` equals 1, the values remain unchanged. Otherwise, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must still be greater than `mdx`, and `res` will be the count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` from index `mdx` to index `n-1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `res` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the middle element (`a[mdx]`) from the middle index towards the end of the list `a`. `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `i` is the last index value that was checked in the loop.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
