Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers. If `n` equals 1, then no changes are made to `t`, `n`, `a`, and `res` remains 0. Otherwise, `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer greater than `mdx` and not equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is 3, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and the middle index `mdx` of the list `a` has the same value as the last index `i` that was checked during the loop, with `res` incremented each time `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`.
