Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer not equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, `res` is 0, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`**

Explanation: The code calculates `mdx` as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. Since `n` is an integer not equal to 1, `n // 2` gives the integer division of `n` by 2, and `n % 2` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 2. This expression effectively calculates the middle index of a list of length `n` (if `n` is odd) or just before the middle (if `n` is even). The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `res` remain unchanged.
