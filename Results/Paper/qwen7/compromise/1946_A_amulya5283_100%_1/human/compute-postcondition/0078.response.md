To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **List `a`**: This is a sorted list of integers.
2. **Variable `n`**: This is the length of the list `a`.
3. **Variable `mdx`**: This is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. For a list of length `n`, this formula gives the middle index of the list. If `n` is even, `mdx` will be the index of the second middle element. If `n` is odd, `mdx` will be the index of the middle element.
4. **Variable `res`**: This holds the count of how many times the middle element (`a[mdx]`) appears consecutively in the list `a` starting from the middle index towards the end of the list.
5. **Variable `t`**: This is decremented by the number of iterations of the loop.
6. **Variable `i`**: This is the last index value that was checked in the loop, which would be `mdx + (number of times the loop executed) - 1`.

Given the print statement `print(res)`, we need to determine the value of `res`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Middle Index Calculation**: `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
2. **Loop Execution**: The loop will check elements from `mdx` to the end of the list `a`. During each iteration, if the current element matches `a[mdx]`, the count `res` is incremented.
3. **Final Value of `res`**: After the loop completes, `res` will hold the count of how many times the middle element appears consecutively from `mdx` to the end of the list.

### Example Scenario:

Let's assume a list `a` with `n = 7` (an odd number of elements):

- `mdx = 7 // 2 + 7 % 2 - 1 = 3 + 1 - 1 = 3`.
- The list `a` could be `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5]`.
- The middle element `a[3]` is `3`.
- The loop will check elements from index 3 to 6: `[3, 3, 3, 4, 5]`.
- The count of `3` from index 3 to 6 is 3.

Thus, `res` will be 3.

### General Case:

For any list `a` of length `n`, `res` will be the count of the middle element from `mdx` to the end of the list.

### Final Output:

Output: **res (where res is the count of the middle element from mdx to the end of the list a)**
