Output State: **`decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is a dictionary containing {'a': 'a'}, `char` is not in `mapping`, the current value of `c` is 97, and the character corresponding to `c` is 'a' in the values of `mapping`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the character represented by `chr(c)` (which is 'a' since `c` is 97) to the key `chr(c)` in the dictionary `mapping`. After this assignment, `mapping` now contains the key-value pair `{'a': 'a'}`. The values of `decoded`, `char`, and `c` remain unchanged.
