Output State: **`c` is 98; `mapping['b']` is `char`; 'b' is not in the values of `mapping`**

Explanation: The code assigns the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `c` (which is 98, corresponding to 'b') to the key `chr(c)` in the dictionary `mapping`. Since `c` is 98, the key in the dictionary is 'b'. The value of `mapping['b']` is set to `char`, and because 'b' was not already in the values of `mapping`, it remains unchanged in this regard.
