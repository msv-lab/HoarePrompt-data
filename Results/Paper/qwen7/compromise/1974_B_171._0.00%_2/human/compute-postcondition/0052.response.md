Output State: **`c` is 'a', `mapping['a']` is the character corresponding to `a`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not modify any variable values or create new bindings. It simply exits the current loop or switch-case structure. Since no such structure was present in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `c` is still 'a', and `mapping['a']` retains its original value, which is the character corresponding to `a`.
