Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):`. The variables involved here are `c`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `c` is within the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This means `c` should be a character between 'a' and 'z'.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'. The condition given is that the character 'b' (which corresponds to `c` being 98) is not in the values of `mapping`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be the next character in the range from 'a' to 'z'. The next character after 'b' is 'c', which corresponds to `c` being 99.

5. **Adjust the State**: Since `c` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `c` will be 99, which corresponds to the character 'c'.

6. **Check the Condition**: We need to ensure that the character 'c' (which corresponds to `c` being 99) is not in the values of `mapping`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`c` is 99**
