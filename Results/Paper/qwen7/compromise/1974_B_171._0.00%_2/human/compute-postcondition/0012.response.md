Output State: **`decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is a dictionary with the key `'b'` and the value `'a'`, and `c` is 98.**

Explanation: The code `mapping[chr(c)] = char` updates the dictionary `mapping` with the key `'b'` (since `chr(98)` is `'b'`) and assigns the value `'a'` to it. The other variables (`decoded` and `c`) remain unchanged.
