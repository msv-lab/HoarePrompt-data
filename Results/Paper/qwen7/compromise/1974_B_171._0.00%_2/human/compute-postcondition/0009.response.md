Output State: **`decoded` is an empty list, `mapping` is a dictionary containing {'a': 'a'}, `char` is not in `mapping`, the current value of `c` is 97, and the character corresponding to `c` is 'a' in the values of `mapping'.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values or add new information; it only indicates the exit from a loop or conditional block. Since no such block was entered in this case, the initial state remains unchanged.
