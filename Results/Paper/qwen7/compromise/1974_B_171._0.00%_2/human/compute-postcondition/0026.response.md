Output State: **`decoded` is a list containing one additional element `'mapping[char]'`, `mapping` remains unchanged, `encoded` remains unchanged, `char` is the next character in `encoded`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `mapping[char]` to the list `decoded`. Since `decoded` initially contains either one element `'mapping[char]'` or is an empty list, after appending, it will contain one more element, which is `'mapping[char]'`. The variables `mapping`, `encoded`, and `char` remain unchanged as no operation was performed on them.
