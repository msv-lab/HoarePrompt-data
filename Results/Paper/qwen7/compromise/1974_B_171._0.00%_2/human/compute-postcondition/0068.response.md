Output State: `decoded` is a list containing all characters from `encoded`, where each character is mapped according to the rules defined in the loop. `mapping` is a dictionary that contains all lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z') as keys, each mapped to the character 'a'. The `encoded` string remains unchanged.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `decoded` will contain every character from the original `encoded` string, with each character replaced by its corresponding mapped value as per the logic inside the loop. The `mapping` dictionary will have all lowercase letters mapped to 'a', and `encoded` will retain its original content since it is not modified within the loop.
