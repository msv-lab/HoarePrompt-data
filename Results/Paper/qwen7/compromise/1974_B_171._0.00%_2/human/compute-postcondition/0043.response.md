Output State: **The variable `c` will be 122 (ord('z')), meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The dictionary `mapping` will contain all letters from 'a' to 'z' as keys, each mapped to the character 'a'. The list `decoded` remains unchanged, and the string `encoded` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: Since the loop iterates over the ASCII values from 'a' to 'z', it will run exactly 26 times (from 97 to 122). After each iteration, if the current character (`chr(c)`) is not already in the values of `mapping`, it gets added with the value `char`. Given that `char` is always the next character in `encoded` and assuming `encoded` contains at least 26 characters starting from 'a', by the end of the loop, every letter from 'a' to 'z' will be a key in `mapping`, each mapped to 'a'. The `decoded` list and `encoded` string remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
