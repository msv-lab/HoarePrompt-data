Output State: **`c` is 'a'; `mapping[chr(c)]` is the character corresponding to `c`.**

Explanation: The code `mapping[chr(c)] = char` assigns the value of `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the dictionary `mapping`. Since `c` is 'a', `chr(c)` evaluates to 'a'. Therefore, `mapping['a']` is now equal to `char`. The value of `c` remains unchanged, and the initial condition that the character corresponding to `c` is not in the values of the dictionary `mapping` is no longer applicable since it has just been added.
