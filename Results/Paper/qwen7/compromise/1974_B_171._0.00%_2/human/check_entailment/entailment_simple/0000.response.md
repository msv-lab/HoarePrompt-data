Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to decode an encoded string back to its original form. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the `func_1` function. Specifically, the function incorrectly maps all characters to 'a', instead of correctly mapping them based on the auxiliary string `r`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Mapping Logic**: The function tries to find the first unused lowercase letter and maps it to the current character. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the structure of the auxiliary string `r` and its reverse mapping. Instead, it should map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the reversed `r`.

2. **Mapping Construction**: The function constructs the `mapping` dictionary by iterating through all lowercase letters and checking if they are already used. This is unnecessary and incorrect for the given problem. The correct approach would involve constructing the `r` string and then using it to create the reverse mapping.

3. **Decoding Process**: The `decoded` list is populated with 'a' characters, which is not what we want. We need to correctly map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the original string `s`.

To fix the issue, the function should follow these steps:
- Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the unique characters of the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
- Create a reverse mapping from `r` to the original characters.
- Use this reverse mapping to decode the encoded string.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    # Step 1: Construct the auxiliary string r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    
    # Step 2: Create the reverse mapping
    mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    
    # Step 3: Decode the encoded string
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    
    return decoded
```

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect due to the flawed mapping logic.

Correctness: **False**
