Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. Specifically, the program attempts to create a mapping from each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the auxiliary string `r`, but it does so in a way that does not guarantee the correct mapping. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Mapping Creation**: The program tries to find the first available character in the alphabet that is not already mapped. This approach can lead to incorrect mappings because it does not ensure that the mapping is consistent with the reverse order required for decoding. For example, consider the encoded string `"serofedsoc"` which should decode to `"codeforces"`.

2. **Example Case**: Let's take the encoded string `"serofedsoc"`. According to the problem description, the auxiliary string `r` should be `"cdefors"`. The correct decoding would map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in `r`. However, the current implementation does not maintain this symmetry correctly.

   - For `"s"`, the correct mapping should be `'c'`.
   - For `"e"`, the correct mapping should be `'f'`.
   - For `"r"`, the correct mapping should be `'o'`.
   - And so on...

   The current implementation may incorrectly map some characters due to the way it creates the mapping. For instance, it might map `'s'` to a different character if it finds another character earlier in the alphabet that hasn't been used yet.

To fix this, the program needs to construct the auxiliary string `r` and then create a mapping from each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in `r`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Create the auxiliary string r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded), key=encoded.index))
    # Create the reverse mapping
    reverse_mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    # Decode the encoded string
    decoded = ''.join(reverse_mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    return decoded
```

This corrected version ensures that the auxiliary string `r` is constructed correctly and that each character in the encoded string is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
