### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The problem requires calculating the remainder of the product of the array elements after each command ('L' or 'R') is processed.
   - The commands should be processed in the order they appear in the string `s`.
   - After each command, the corresponding element is removed from the array, and the next product is calculated.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to process the commands and calculate the required remainders.
   - The main loop correctly reads the input for each test case.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` is flawed:
     - It incorrectly appends elements to `b` based on the command direction without updating the array `a`.
     - It calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which does not match the problem requirements.
     - The final result should be the remainders of the products, not the products themselves.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - We need to keep track of the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` after each command.
   - For each command, update the product by multiplying it with the current element and taking the modulo `m`.
   - Remove the element from the array based on the command direction.

4. **Corrected Code**:
   - The corrected `func_1` function should:
     - Initialize the product `p` to 1.
     - Iterate through the commands in `s` and update the product accordingly.
     - Append the remainder of the product to the result list `ans`.
     - Update the array `a` by removing the appropriate element based on the command.

Here is the corrected `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for i in range(n):
        p = (p * a[0]) % m
        ans.append(p)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
    return ans
```

### Final Evaluation:

- The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the remainders of the product of the array elements after each command.
- The annotated code further confirms this by showing that the implementation does not follow the problem requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
