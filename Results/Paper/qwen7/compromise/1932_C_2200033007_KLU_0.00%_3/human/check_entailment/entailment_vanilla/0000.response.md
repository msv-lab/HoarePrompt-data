Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the value `m`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and the string of commands `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to handle the logic of processing the commands and calculating the remainders.
   - However, there is a significant issue with how the function processes the commands. The function `func_1` does not actually compute the product of the array elements modulo `m` and then remove elements as specified in the problem statement. Instead, it incorrectly appends the elements of the array to a list `b` based on the direction ('L' or 'R') but does not perform any modulo operations or removals.

3. **Modulo Operations and Removals:**
   - The problem requires computing the product of the remaining elements of the array modulo `m` after each command.
   - The function should maintain a running product of the array elements and update this product as elements are removed.
   - The function `func_1` does not maintain a running product and does not remove elements from the array as required.

4. **Reversing the List:**
   - The function `func_1` reverses the list `b` before returning it, which is not necessary and does not solve the problem.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to compute the product of the remaining elements modulo `m` and to remove elements from the array as specified.

### Correctness

**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the product calculation and element removal as required by the problem statement.
