Reasoning:
- The program needs to process each command in the string `s` and output the remainder of the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` after each operation.
- The provided code does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` after removing elements based on the commands in `s`.
- Instead of constructing a new list `b` and then calculating the product in reverse, the program should directly calculate the product of the remaining elements in `a` after each removal and append the result to the answer list.
- The current implementation constructs a list `b` which is not used correctly and reverses the operations in an incorrect manner.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, you need to modify the `func_1` function to directly compute the product of the remaining elements in `a` after each removal and append the result to the answer list. Here's the corrected version:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for i in range(n):
        p = (p * a[i]) % m
        ans.append(p)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
    return ans
```

This corrected version directly computes the product of the remaining elements in `a` after each removal and appends the result to the answer list `ans`.
