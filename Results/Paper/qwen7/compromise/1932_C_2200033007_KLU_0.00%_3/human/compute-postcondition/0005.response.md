Output State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of positive integers, `s` is a string consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters with length `n`, `b` is a list where elements from `a` are appended based on the direction indicated by `s`, `r` is -1.

In the output state, the variable `b` will contain elements from the list `a`. The elements are appended to `b` based on the direction specified by each character in the string `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', the element at index `l` in `a` is appended to `b` and `l` is incremented. If `s[i]` is 'R', the element at index `r` in `a` is appended to `b` and `r` is decremented. After all iterations, `l` remains 0 because it is only incremented and `r` is decremented until it becomes -1.
