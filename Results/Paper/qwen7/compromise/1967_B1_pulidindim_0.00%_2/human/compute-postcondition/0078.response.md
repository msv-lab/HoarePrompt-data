Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / count`.**

The code `g = n / count` assigns the value of `n / count` to the variable `g`. Given that `count` is initially 1, `g` becomes `n / 1`, which simplifies to `n`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `count`, `ans`, and `countmins` remain unchanged from their initial states.
