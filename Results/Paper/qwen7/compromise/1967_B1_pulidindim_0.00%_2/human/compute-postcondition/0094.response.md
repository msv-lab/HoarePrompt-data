Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 0) + g / count + 1`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is now `n / 2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `g / count + 1` to its current value. Given the initial state, `ans` is initially set to `n + (n / 2 - 0)`, which simplifies to `n + n / 2`. After executing `ans += g / count + 1`, `ans` becomes `n + n / 2 + g / count + 1`. Since `g` is defined as `n / 2 - 1`, substituting `g` into the equation gives `ans` as `n + n / 2 + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `n + n / 2 + n / 4 - 1 / 2 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
