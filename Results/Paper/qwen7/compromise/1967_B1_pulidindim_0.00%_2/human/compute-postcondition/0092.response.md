Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 4, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 0)`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is `n / 2 - 0`, `g` is now `n / 2`, if `g < countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
