Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `countmins` is 0, `g` is `n / count`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the innermost if statement. Since no variables are reassigned or modified by the `break` statement, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
