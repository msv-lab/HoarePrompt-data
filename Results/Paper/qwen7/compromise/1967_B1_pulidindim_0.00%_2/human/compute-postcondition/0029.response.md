Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input split, `m` must be at least 2, `count` is 5, `g` is \(n / 5\), `ans` is \(n + (n / 3 - 0) / 3 + 1 + g / count + 1\), `countmins` is 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
