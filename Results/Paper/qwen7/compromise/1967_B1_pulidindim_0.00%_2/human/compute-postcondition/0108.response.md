Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an integer such that the loop condition `count <= m` evaluates to false, `count` is `m + 1`, `ans` is the sum of `n` plus the series \(\sum_{k=2}^{m+1} \left(\frac{n}{k} - (k-2)\right) + 1\), `countmins` is 0, `g` is now `n / (m + 1) - 0**.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop continues incrementing `count` starting from 2 until it no longer satisfies the condition `count <= m`. At this point, `count` becomes `m + 1`. The variable `ans` accumulates the sum based on the formula provided for each iteration of the loop, which includes terms like \(\frac{n}{k} - (k-2) + 1\) for each `k` from 2 to `m + 1`. The other variables (`countmins` and `g`) are updated according to the loop's logic, with `countmins` being 0 and `g` being `n / (m + 1) - 0` for the final iteration.
