Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) but does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- According to the problem description, valid pairs include (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4). This gives us 16 valid pairs.
- However, the program outputs 14, which is incorrect.

The program's logic is flawed because it does not properly iterate through all possible pairs and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). A correct implementation would involve iterating through all pairs and checking the condition directly.
