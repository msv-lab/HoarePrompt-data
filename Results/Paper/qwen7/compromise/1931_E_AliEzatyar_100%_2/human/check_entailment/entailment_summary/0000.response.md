Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the given rules.
2. The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer.
3. The main part of the program processes each test case as follows:
   - Reads the number of integers (`n`) and the parameter `m`.
   - Reads the list of integers.
   - Counts the total number of digits in the list.
   - Counts the number of trailing zeros for each integer and sorts them in descending order.
   - Calculates a value (`subtract_zero`) by summing every other element from the sorted list of zeros (starting from the largest).
   - Determines the difference between the total number of digits and `subtract_zero`.
   - Compares this difference with `m + 1` to decide the winner.
4. The logic for deciding the winner is correct according to the problem statement:
   - If the difference is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, Sasha wins.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.
5. The program outputs the correct winner for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
