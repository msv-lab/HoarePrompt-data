Let's analyze the given information and the for loop step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration:
  - `counter` is either 1 or 2.
  - `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 10^9\).
  - The length of `num` is at least 1.
  - The character `num[i]` is '0', where `i` is `len(num) - 2`.

- The loop iterates over the range from `len(num) - 1` down to 0 with a step of -1.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop runs as long as `i` is within the specified range.

### Current State:
- `counter` is either 1 or 2.
- `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 10^9\).
- The length of `num` is at least 1.
- The character `num[i]` is '0', where `i` is `len(num) - 2`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` starts at `len(num) - 1`.
   - The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.

2. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is now `len(num) - 2`.
   - The character `num[i]` is '0'.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `len(num) - 3`.

### Adjusting States:
- **`i`**: The value of `i` will be `len(num) - 3`.
- **`counter`**: The value of `counter` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop changes it.
- **`num`**: The value of `num` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop is iterating backwards and the condition `num[i] == '0'` is already met at `i = len(num) - 2`, the next iteration will check `num[len(num) - 3]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num} \leq 10^9\), and the length of `num` is at least 1, and the character `num[i]` is '0', where `i` is `len(num) - 3`.**
