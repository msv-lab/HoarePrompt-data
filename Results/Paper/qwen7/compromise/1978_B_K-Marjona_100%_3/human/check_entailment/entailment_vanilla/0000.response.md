Let's reason through the given program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `k` is initialized as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This means `k` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price while ensuring that the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price `a`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so all buns should be sold at the usual price `a`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula:
     - `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`
     - Here, `b * k` is the total revenue from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
     - `- k * (k - 1) // 2` accounts for the decreasing sequence of prices for the first `k` buns.
     - `(n - k) * a` is the total revenue from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Output: `17`
   - Explanation: 
     - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
     - Profit: `5 * 1 - 1 * 0 + 3 * 4 = 5 + 12 = 17`

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Output: `35`
   - Explanation:
     - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
     - Profit: `9 * 4 - 4 * 3 // 2 + 1 * 5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35`

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Output: `100`
   - Explanation:
     - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
     - Profit: `10 * 10 = 100`

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Output: `45`
   - Explanation:
     - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
     - Profit: `11 * 5 - 5 * 4 // 2 + 0 * 5 = 55 - 10 = 45`

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000`
   - Explanation:
     - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
     - Profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000`
   - Explanation:
     - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
     - Profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Output: `500500`
   - Explanation:
     - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 1`
     - Profit: `1000 * 1 - 1 * 0 + 999 * 1 = 1000 + 999 = 1999`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the profit based on the given conditions. It handles both scenarios where the modified price is beneficial and when it is not.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
