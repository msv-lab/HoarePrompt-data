Postcondition: **The final value of `greater_count` is the total count of elements in list `a` that are less than `favorite_value`. `same_value_count` is the count of elements in list `a` that are equal to `favorite_value`. The sum of `greater_count` and `same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`.**
