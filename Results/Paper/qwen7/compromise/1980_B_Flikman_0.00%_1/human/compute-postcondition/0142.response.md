Postcondition: `greater_count` is the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than the `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is between 0 and the length of list `a`, inclusive, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `f` is the integer value of the second input, `k` is the integer value of the third input, and `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in list `a`. If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, then `greater_count` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`.
