Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element to an integer before storing them in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, and `k` remain unchanged.
