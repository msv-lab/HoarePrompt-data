Postcondition: `value` is the next element in the list `a`, `greater_count` is either 1 or 2, `same_value_count` is between 0 and the length of the new list `a`, inclusive, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `f` is the integer value of the second input, `k` is the integer value of the third input, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in the new list `a`. If `value` is greater than `favorite_value`, `greater_count` is 2; otherwise, `greater_count` remains 1.
