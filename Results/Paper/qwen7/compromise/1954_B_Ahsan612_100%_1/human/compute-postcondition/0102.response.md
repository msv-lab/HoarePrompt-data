Output State: **`minn` is infinity, the number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is 1, `i` is 2, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. Given that `ar[i]` was not equal to `num` before, and now it is equal to `num`, the only change is that `num` is now equal to `ar[0]` (since `i` is 2 and `ar[i]` is now equal to `num`). All other variables remain unchanged.
