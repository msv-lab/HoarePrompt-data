Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head condition is `i < len(ar)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(ar)`.

2. **Current state of the variables**:
   - `same` is 1 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly relevant to the loop condition).
   - `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `num` is the first element of the list `ar`.
   - `minn` is infinity (not directly relevant to the loop condition).

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute if `i < len(ar)`.
   - Currently, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Given that `i` is currently 1, the condition `i < len(ar)` will depend on the value of `len(ar)`. Therefore, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `len(ar)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1**
