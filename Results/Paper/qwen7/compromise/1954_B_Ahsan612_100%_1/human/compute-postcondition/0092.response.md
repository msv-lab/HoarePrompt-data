Output State: **The number of iterations left is 0, `n` is an input integer, `same` is the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `num` in the list, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list starting from index 1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `minn` is either infinity, the length of the list `ar`, or the minimum of `minn` and `same`, unless `minn` is neither infinity nor the length of the list `ar`, in which case `minn` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in the list `ar`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `same`, `minn`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `ar` is updated to the list of integers entered by the user.
