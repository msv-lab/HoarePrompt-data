Output State: **`minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and 1, `same` is 1, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `num` is equal to the last element checked before the loop ends.**

Explanation: The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`minn`) and the value of `same`, which is 1. The value of `same` remains unchanged at 1, and the other variables (`i`, `ar`, and `num`) also remain unchanged from their previous states.
