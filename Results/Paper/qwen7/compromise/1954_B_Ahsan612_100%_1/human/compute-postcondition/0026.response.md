Postcondition: `same` is either 3 or 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is either 3 or 4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is either the first element of the list `ar` or the fourth element of the list `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and the corresponding element in `ar` if they are equal; otherwise, `minn` remains as previously defined (either the minimum value or infinity).
