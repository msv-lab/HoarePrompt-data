Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, `minn` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. The value of `ar[i]` is not specified directly, but it is known that `ar[i]` is not equal to the first element of the list `ar`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
