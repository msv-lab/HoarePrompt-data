Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is `ar[4]`, and `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `ar[4]` if `ar[4]` equals `num`; otherwise, `minn` remains 2.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`minn`) and `same`. Given that `same` is 2, and assuming `minn` was previously set to infinity (or a value greater than 2) before this line of code, `minn` will now be updated to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
