Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 1; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is either 5 or 6; `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5; `num` is now `ar[i]`; `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `same`.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`num` if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `same` if `same` is 3, or 2 if `same` is 1) and `same`. Since `same` is either 3 or 1, `minn` will be updated to `same` if `num` is greater than `same`, or remain `num` (which is `ar[i]`) if `num` is less than or equal to `same`. The other variables remain unchanged.
