Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`.
   - We need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` results in a valid number of iterations.

3. **Constraints and Validations:**
   - Each test case (`t`) is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - This means the input should be an integer within this range for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input to `int(input())`, ensuring it falls within the specified range.

**Final State Adjustment:**

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
