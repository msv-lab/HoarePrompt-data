Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - The number of iterations left is 0.
   - `n` is the length of the list `ar` minus 1.
   - `same` is the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `num` in the list.
   - `minn` is the minimum value found in the list starting from index 1.
   - `i` is equal to `n + 1`.
   - `minn` is equal to either infinity, the length of the list `ar`, or the minimum of `minn` and `same`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(-1)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is set to `n + 1`. Since `n` is the length of `ar` minus 1, `i` would be the length of `ar`.
- `minn` is defined as being either infinity, the length of the list `ar`, or the minimum of `minn` and `same`. However, since `minn` is already set to one of these values, it remains unchanged.
- The other variables (`iterations_left`, `same`, `minn`) do not affect the print statement directly.

The print statement simply outputs `-1`. There is no need to derive the values of other variables because the print statement does not reference them.

Output: **-1**
