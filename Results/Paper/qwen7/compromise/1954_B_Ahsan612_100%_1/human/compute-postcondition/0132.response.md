Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`minn` is the minimum value between `minn` and 1**: 
   - Since `minn` is being set to the minimum of itself and 1, and it must already be less than or equal to 1 (because if it were greater than 1, the condition would not hold), `minn` must be 1. This is because the minimum value between any number and 1 is 1 if the number is greater than or equal to 1, and remains the same if it is already 1.

2. **`same` is 1**:
   - This is explicitly stated, so `same` is 1.

3. **`i` is equal to `len(ar)`**:
   - `i` is set to the length of the list `ar`.

4. **`ar` is a list of integers entered by the user**:
   - The exact contents of `ar` are not specified, but we know it is a list of integers.

5. **`num` is equal to the last element checked before the loop ends**:
   - This implies that there was a loop that checked elements of `ar`, and `num` is the last element that was checked.

6. **The condition `(minn == inf or minn == len(ar))` is false**:
   - Given that `minn` is 1, this condition cannot be true because neither 1 is infinity (`inf`) nor is 1 equal to the length of `ar` (since `i` is the length of `ar` and `minn` is 1). Therefore, this condition is irrelevant to the value of `minn`.

Given these points, the only variable whose value is explicitly printed is `minn`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
