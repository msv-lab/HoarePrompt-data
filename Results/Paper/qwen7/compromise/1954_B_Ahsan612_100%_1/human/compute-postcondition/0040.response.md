Output State: **`same` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` (or the first element if no other elements match `num`), and `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and the current `same` value.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the smaller of its current value and the current value of `same`. This means `minn` now holds the minimum of its previous value and the current value of `same`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
