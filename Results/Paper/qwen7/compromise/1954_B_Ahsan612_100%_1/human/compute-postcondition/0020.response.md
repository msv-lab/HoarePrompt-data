The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `i < len(ar)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `ar`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `same` is 2
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
- `num` is the first element of the list `ar`
- `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`; otherwise, `minn` remains infinity

To determine whether the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition `i < len(ar)`.

Given that `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented and should still satisfy the condition `i < len(ar)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented to a value that keeps it less than `len(ar)`.

Since no other variables in the loop head affect the loop condition directly, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` must be 3, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`; otherwise, `minn` remains infinity.**
