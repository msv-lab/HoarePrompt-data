Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code initializes `minn` to infinity (represented as `inf` in Python). This does not affect the values of the other variables (`same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged, and `minn` is set to infinity.
