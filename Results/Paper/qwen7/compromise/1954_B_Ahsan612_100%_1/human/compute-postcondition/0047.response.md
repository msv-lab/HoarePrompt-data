Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is controlled by the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop will run for as many times as the user inputs.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `same` is a non-negative integer.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `num` is the last element of the list `ar` (or the first element if no other elements match `num`).
   - `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and the current `same` value. If `minn` is infinity or equal to the length of the list `ar`, then `minn` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `minn` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `minn` and the current `same` value.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will run again based on the user input for `int(input())`. Therefore, the number of iterations left is determined by the new input.
   - The variables `same`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, and `minn` will be reset or updated according to the loop body, but their initial values for the next iteration are not specified in the given information. We only know the conditions under which the loop continues.

Since the loop is controlled by the user input, the only thing we can adjust is the number of iterations left, which is determined by the new input.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- The number of iterations left is now the new input value for `int(input())`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **the number of iterations left is the new input value for `int(input())`**
