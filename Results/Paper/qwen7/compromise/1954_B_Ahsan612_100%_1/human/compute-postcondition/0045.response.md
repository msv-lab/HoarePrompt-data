Postcondition: `same` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` (or the first element if no other elements match `num`), and `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and the current `same` value. If `minn` is infinity or equal to the length of the list `ar`, the postcondition remains unchanged. Otherwise, `minn` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `minn` and the current `same` value.
