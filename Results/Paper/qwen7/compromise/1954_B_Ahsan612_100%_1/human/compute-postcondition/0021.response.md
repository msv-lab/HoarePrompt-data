Output State: **`same` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` must be 3, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value between `num` and `ar[i]` if `ar[i]` equals `num`; otherwise, `minn` remains infinity.**

Explanation: The variable `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
