Output State: **the number of iterations left is the new input value for `int(input())`, `n` is the integer value of the input.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes the number of iterations left from the initial state (which is an input value) and converts it into an integer. This integer value is stored in the variable `n`. The precondition that the number of iterations left is the new input value remains valid, and now we also know that `n` is the integer representation of this input.
