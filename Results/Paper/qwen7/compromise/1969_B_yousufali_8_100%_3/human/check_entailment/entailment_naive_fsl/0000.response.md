Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string by counting the number of '0's followed by '1's, but this approach is flawed. It does not account for the fact that multiple cyclic shifts can be performed to achieve the minimum cost.

For example, consider the input string "101011":
- The function would count the transitions between '0' and '1', resulting in a cost of 5 (as there are four transitions).
- However, the optimal solution involves performing three cyclic shifts:
  1. Shift "101011" to "010111" (cost 2)
  2. Shift "010111" to "101110" (cost 2)
  3. Shift "101110" to "011101" (cost 2)

The total cost is 6, not 5. Therefore, the provided function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all possible cases.
