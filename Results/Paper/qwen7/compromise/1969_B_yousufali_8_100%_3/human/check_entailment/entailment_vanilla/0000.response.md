### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. A cyclic shift of a substring costs the length of that substring.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `n` to count consecutive '1's and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - It iterates through the string:
     - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans` and resets `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
   - For example, consider the string "101011". The function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5, but the correct cost is 9 as explained in the problem statement.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For "10", the function correctly calculates the cost as 2.
   - For "0000", the function correctly calculates the cost as 0.
   - For "11000", the function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 4 instead of 3.
   - For "101011", the function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5 instead of 9.
   - For "01101001", the function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 8 instead of 11.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not accurately calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.
