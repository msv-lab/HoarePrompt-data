Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white. Specifically, the program only considers the first and last positions of black cells but does not account for the possibility of multiple segments of black cells within the strip. For example, consider the input "WBWBWWWBW". The program would incorrectly output 4, but the correct answer should be 7, as painting the segment from the 2nd to the 8th cell (inclusive) would turn all cells white.
