Output State: **`p` is the length of the binary representation of `f - 2` without the '0b' prefix; `q` is 2**.

Explanation: The value of `q` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `f` is updated to `f - 2`. The value of `p` is now determined based on the new value of `f`, which is `f - 2`. Therefore, `p` is the length of the binary representation of `f - 2` without the '0b' prefix.
