Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 10^9). For each test case, it returns a value based on the relationship between `x` and `y`.**

- If `x` is less than `y`, the function returns "x < y".
- If `x` is equal to `y`, the function returns "x = y".
- If `x` is greater than `y`, the function returns "x > y".
