Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    k = abs(n - m)
    if k & k - 1 == 0:
        print(k)
    elif k % 2 != 0:
        print(1)
    else:
        l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
        p = len(l)
        q = 2 ** (p - 1)
        f = k - q
        while f & f - 1 != 0:
            l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            f = f - q
        print(f)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `m` is an integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, `k` remains as it is. Otherwise, if `k` is odd, `k` remains unchanged. If `k` is even, `k` becomes 0, and `l` is "0", `p` is 1, and `q` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is "0", `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f - 2`, and `q` is 1 if `k` is a power of 2, otherwise `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, and `f` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, the function does not change any additional variables. If `k` is not a power of 2, then `k` is not a power of 2, `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2, and `f` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
