Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0. The input values for `n` and `m` are specified to be positive integers between 1 and \(10^4\).
