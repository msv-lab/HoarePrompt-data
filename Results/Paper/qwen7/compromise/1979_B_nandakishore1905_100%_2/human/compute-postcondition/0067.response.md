Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `m` as input integers, along with the unchanged value of `i`.
