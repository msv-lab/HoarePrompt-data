State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is now 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains two variables: `_` (which is used as a placeholder) and `t`.
- The variable `_` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is within the required range and `_` is set to 0 to start the loop.
