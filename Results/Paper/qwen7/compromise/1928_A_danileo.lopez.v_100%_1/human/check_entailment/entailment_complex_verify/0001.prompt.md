You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

    #State: Output State: The output will consist of 'Yes' or 'No' for each iteration based on the conditions provided in the loop. Specifically, if either `a` or `b` is even, and the halved value of the even number does not match the other number, 'Yes' will be printed; otherwise, 'No' will be printed. If neither `a` nor `b` is even, 'No' will always be printed. The exact sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' depends on the input values for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). It checks whether either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If \(a\) is even, it checks if half of \(a\) equals \(b\); if \(b\) is even, it checks if half of \(b\) equals \(a\). If either condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. This process is repeated for each test case specified by the positive integer \(t\). The function does not return any value but prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Checking Even Sides:**
   - The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
     - If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two equal halves (`a1` and `a2`), both equal to `a // 2`.
     - If `b` is even, it splits `b` into two equal halves (`b1` and `b2`), both equal to `b // 2`.

3. **Condition for "Yes":**
   - If `a` is even and `a1` (which is `a // 2`) is not equal to `b`, it prints "Yes".
   - Similarly, if `b` is even and `b1` (which is `b // 2`) is not equal to `a`, it prints "Yes".
   - In both cases, if the condition is met, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next test case.

4. **Condition for "No":**
   - If neither `a` nor `b` is even, it prints "No".

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Case 1: Both `a` and `b` are odd.**
  - The program correctly identifies this case and prints "No" because no matter how you split an odd number, you cannot form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

- **Case 2: One of `a` or `b` is even.**
  - If `a` is even, splitting it into two equal halves and checking if the halves do not match `b` is correct.
  - If `b` is even, splitting it into two equal halves and checking if the halves do not match `a` is correct.
  - However, the current implementation only checks if `a1` or `b1` does not match the other dimension. This is not sufficient to ensure a new rectangle can be formed.

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: (1, 1)**
   - Both dimensions are odd, so the program correctly prints "No".

2. **Test Case: (2, 1)**
   - `a` is even, but `a1` (1) matches `b`, so the program incorrectly prints "No".

3. **Test Case: (2, 6)**
   - `a` is even, `a1` (1) does not match `b` (6), so the program correctly prints "Yes".

4. **Test Case: (3, 2)**
   - `b` is even, `b1` (1) does not match `a` (3), so the program correctly prints "Yes".

5. **Test Case: (2, 2)**
   - Both dimensions are even, but splitting them results in `a1` (1) matching `b` (2), so the program incorrectly prints "No".

6. **Test Case: (2, 4)**
   - `a` is even, `a1` (1) does not match `b` (4), so the program correctly prints "Yes".

7. **Test Case: (6, 3)**
   - `a` is even, `a1` (3) matches `b` (3), so the program incorrectly prints "No".

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where one dimension is even and the other is odd, and the halves do not form a new rectangle. The logic needs to be more comprehensive to ensure all conditions are checked correctly.

**Correctness: **False**
