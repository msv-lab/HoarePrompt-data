Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them.
2. The annotated program correctly checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If so, it checks if the halves of the even side do not match the other dimension, indicating that a new rectangle can be formed.
3. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no new rectangle can be formed since the only way to cut would result in two identical smaller rectangles, which cannot be rearranged into a different rectangle.
4. The logic in the program matches the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution based on the problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
