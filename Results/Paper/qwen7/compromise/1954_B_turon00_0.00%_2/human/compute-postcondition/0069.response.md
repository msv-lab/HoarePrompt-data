Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is an input integer, `tmp` retains its initial value, `t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `ans` or `tmp`, and `t` is only mentioned to be greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `cnt` is now set to the value of `n` (an input integer). Therefore, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, which is now `n`.
