Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, `tmp` now holds the value of `a[0]`.
