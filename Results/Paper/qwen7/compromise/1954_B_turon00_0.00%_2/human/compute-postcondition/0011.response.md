Output State: **`ans` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the elements of the list `a`, `cnt` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
