Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the elements of the list `a`, `cnt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == tmp:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list, `tmp` is an integer. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is set to 0 and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the list such that `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `a[i] == tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is set to 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_prev + 2` or `i_prev + 3`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is either incremented by 1 if `a[i] == tmp`, or set to 0, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
