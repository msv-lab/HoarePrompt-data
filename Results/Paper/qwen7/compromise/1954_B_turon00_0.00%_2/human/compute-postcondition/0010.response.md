Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the elements of the list `a`, `cnt` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, or `aa`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
