Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs according to some unspecified logic and returns a result for each test case.
