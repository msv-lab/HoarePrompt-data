Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `ans` is assigned the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`**

Explanation: The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. However, since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, we only know that `ans` now holds the minimum value between its original value (if any) and `cnt`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
