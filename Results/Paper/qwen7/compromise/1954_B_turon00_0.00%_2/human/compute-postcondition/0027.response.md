Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is `i_prev + 3`, `tmp` is an integer, `cnt` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `tmp`, `ans`, and `n`) are not affected by this line of code. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `i_prev + 2` remains valid. Additionally, the condition for updating `cnt` and `ans` also remains unchanged.
