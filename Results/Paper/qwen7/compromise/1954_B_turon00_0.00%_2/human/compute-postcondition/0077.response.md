Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` should start at 0 (the default starting value for `range(n)`).
   - `n` is already given as the initial value of `ans`.

3. **Adjust the states of the objects**:
   - `i` needs to be set to 0.
   - `n` should be set to its initial value, which is `ans`.

4. **Consider other objects in the program state**:
   - `tmp`, `t`, `a`, `aa`, and `cnt` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `ans`**
