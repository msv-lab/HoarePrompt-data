Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to `n-2`.
- `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
- `cnt` is an input integer.
- `a` is updated to a list of integers entered by the user.
- `aa` is a set containing all unique elements of the list `a`.

The `print(-1)` statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
