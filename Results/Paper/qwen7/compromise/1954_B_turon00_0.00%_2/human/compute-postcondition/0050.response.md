Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `cnt` is 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `i`, or `a[i]` which are still as per the initial state. Therefore, `ans` remains updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is still `n-2`, `cnt` is now 0, and `a[i]` is still not equal to `tmp`.
