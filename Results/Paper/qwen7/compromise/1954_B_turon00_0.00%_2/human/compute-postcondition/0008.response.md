Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`.
- `aa` is a set containing the elements of the list `a`.
- The current value of `aa` contains only one unique element.

Given this information, the `print(-1)` statement will simply print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
