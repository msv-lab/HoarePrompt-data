Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is `ans`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue if `n` (which is `ans`) is greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `n` (which is `ans`) must remain the same unless the condition inside the loop changes it.

Given the postcondition, if `a[i]` equals `tmp`, then `n` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` is set to the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0. However, since we are only adjusting the loop head states, we do not change `ans` here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `n` is `ans`

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `ans`**
