You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `ans` will hold the overall minimum value of `cnt` encountered across all iterations, `t` will be 0, `i` will be `n-1`, `tmp` will be equal to the last element of the list `a`, `cnt` will be 0, and `aa` will still contain all elements of the list `a` as a set.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made into an array of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to check if all elements are the same.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed to make it non-beautiful.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive identical elements and finds the minimum count of consecutive identical elements.
   - Finally, it prints this minimum count as the answer.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Case 1: All Elements are the Same**
     - If all elements are the same, the code correctly prints `-1`.
   - **Case 2: Array is Beautiful but Not All Elements are the Same**
     - The code correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive identical elements.
     - This minimum count represents the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty of the array.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The code handles the edge case where all elements are the same correctly.
     - The code does not handle the case where the array is not beautiful, which is not required according to the problem statement.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, given that the array is initially beautiful.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description.
