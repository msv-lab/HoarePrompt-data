### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to check if all elements are the same.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed to make it non-beautiful.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive identical elements and finds the minimum count of consecutive identical elements.
   - Finally, it prints this minimum count as the answer.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Case 1: All Elements are the Same**:
     - If all elements are the same, the code correctly prints `-1`.
   - **Case 2: Array is Beautiful but Not All Elements are the Same**:
     - The code correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive identical elements.
     - However, the logic to find the minimum number of consecutive identical elements is flawed. The code only counts consecutive identical elements starting from the first element and does not consider the possibility of removing elements to break the beauty of the array.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The code does not handle the case where the array is not beautiful, which is not required according to the problem statement.

4. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The code uses `tmp` to keep track of the first element and counts consecutive identical elements starting from the first element. However, this approach does not guarantee finding the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty of the array.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The code would count the consecutive `1`s starting from the first element and find the minimum count as `1`. However, the correct answer should be `1` (removing the second `1`).
   - The code does not consider the possibility of breaking the beauty by removing elements from different parts of the array.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only counts consecutive identical elements starting from the first element, which may not always yield the correct result.
