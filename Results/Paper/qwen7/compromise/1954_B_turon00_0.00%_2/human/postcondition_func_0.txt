The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of the same integer in the list `a`. If all elements in the list are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of such consecutive occurrences across all test cases.
