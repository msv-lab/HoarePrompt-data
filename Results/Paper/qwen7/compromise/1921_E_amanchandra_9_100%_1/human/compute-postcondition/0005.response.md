Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of six positive integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). For each test case, it compares \(x_a\) and \(x_b\). If \(x_a\) is greater than \(x_b\), it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates a value \(x\) as half the absolute difference between \(x_a\) and \(x_b\). Depending on the positions of \(b\) and \(d\) relative to \(x\), it determines whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins and prints the corresponding result ('Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'). The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
