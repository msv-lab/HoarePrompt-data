Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. For each input set (r, w, a, b, c, d), the program compares a and c. If a is greater than c, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates x as half the absolute difference between a and c, then determines whether Alice or Bob wins based on the positions b and d relative to the calculated range.
