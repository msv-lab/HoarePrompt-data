### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - It then reads the dimensions of the board (`r`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`).

2. **Basic Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if Alice's row position (`a`) is greater than Bob's row position (`c`). If true, it directly prints "Draw". This condition is correct because if Alice is already below Bob, Bob can never catch up, so the game is a draw.

3. **Detailed Logic for Winning Conditions**:
   - The logic calculates the difference in row positions (`abs(a - c)`).
   - If this difference is odd, it calculates the possible range for Alice's chip (`l` and `r`) based on the middle point between Alice and Bob.
   - It then checks if Bob's column position (`b`) falls within this range plus one extra cell to account for diagonal moves. If it does, Alice can win; otherwise, it's a draw.
   - If the difference is even, it calculates the possible range for Bob's chip similarly and checks if Alice's column position (`d`) falls within this range. If it does, Bob can win; otherwise, it's a draw.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the calculated ranges might extend beyond the board boundaries (using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)`).
   - However, there are some issues with the logic:
     - When the difference is odd, the program calculates the range for Alice and checks if Bob's column position falls within this range. This is incorrect because it should be checking if Alice's column position (`d`) falls within the range, not Bob's.
     - Similarly, when the difference is even, the program checks if Alice's column position falls within the range, which is incorrect. It should be checking if Bob's column position (`b`) falls within the range.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program uses `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition])` to format the output, which is correct for the given problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided program has logical errors in determining the winning conditions. Specifically, it incorrectly checks the positions of the wrong player in the conditional checks. Therefore, the program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
