You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. For each input set (r, w, a, b, c, d), the program compares a and c. If a is greater than c, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates x as half the absolute difference between a and c, then determines whether Alice or Bob wins based on the positions b and d relative to the calculated range.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of six positive integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). For each test case, it compares \(x_a\) and \(x_b\). If \(x_a\) is greater than \(x_b\), it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates a value \(x\) as half the absolute difference between \(x_a\) and \(x_b\). Depending on the positions of \(b\) and \(d\) relative to \(x\), it determines whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' wins and prints the corresponding result ('Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'). The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described. Specifically, the program incorrectly determines the outcome of the game based on the relative positions of Alice's and Bob's chips without considering the optimal moves each player can make.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Outcome**:
   - The program checks if `a > c` (Alice's row position greater than Bob's row position) and prints "Draw" if this condition is true. This is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal moves available to each player.
   - The program then calculates the number of steps `x` based on the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's row positions (`abs(a - c)`). However, it does not correctly account for the diagonal moves allowed by Alice and the vertical moves allowed by Bob.
   - The program then checks if the calculated range `[l, r]` for Alice's possible moves intersects with Bob's current column position `b`. This logic is flawed because it does not fully capture the optimal strategy for both players.

2. **Example Case Where the Program Fails**:
   - Consider the following test case:
     ```
     6 5 2 2 5 3
     ```
   - In this case, Alice starts at (2, 2) and Bob starts at (5, 3).
   - Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left. Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.
   - The program incorrectly prints "Draw" because it does not properly evaluate the optimal moves for both players.

To correctly implement the game logic, the program needs to simulate the optimal moves for both players and determine the winner based on the rules provided. The current implementation does not fully capture these rules and thus is incorrect.
