### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - It then reads the dimensions of the board (`r`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`).

2. **Basic Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if Alice's row position (`a`) is greater than Bob's row position (`c`). If true, it directly prints "Draw". This condition is correct because if Alice is already below Bob, Bob can never catch up, so the game is a draw.

3. **Detailed Logic for Winning Conditions**:
   - The logic calculates the difference in row positions (`abs(a - c)`).
   - If this difference is odd, it calculates the possible range for Alice's chip (`l` and `r`) based on the middle point between Alice and Bob.
   - It then checks if Bob's column position (`b`) falls within this range plus one extra cell to account for diagonal moves. If it does, Alice can win; otherwise, it's a draw.
   - If the difference is even, it calculates the possible range for Bob's chip similarly and checks if Alice's column position (`d`) falls within this range. If it does, Bob can win; otherwise, it's a draw.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the calculated ranges might extend beyond the board boundaries (using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)`).
   - However, there are some issues with the logic for determining the winning conditions:
     - When the difference is odd, the program checks if Bob's column position `b` falls within the range `[l, r]`. This is correct if Alice can win by moving diagonally.
     - When the difference is even, the program checks if Alice's column position `d` falls within the range `[l, r]`. This is incorrect because Bob can still win by moving vertically.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program uses `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition])` to format the output, which is correct for the given problem statement.

### Specific Issues:
- **Odd Difference Calculation**: 
  - The logic for checking if Alice can win when the difference is odd is correct.
- **Even Difference Calculation**:
  - The logic for checking if Bob can win when the difference is even is incorrect. Bob can still win by moving vertically, and the current logic does not account for this.

### Correct Solution:
To fix the issue, we need to correctly handle the even difference case. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (r, w, a, b, c, d) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly stated that the program handles all conditions correctly. Specifically, the even difference case needs to be fixed to ensure Bob can win if he can move vertically.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
