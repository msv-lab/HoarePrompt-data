Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the given rules and constraints. Let's break down the key parts of the program:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Initial Position Check**: 
   - If Alice's initial row position (`a`) is greater than Bob's initial row position (`c`), it directly prints "Draw".
   - Otherwise, it calculates the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's initial row positions (`x = abs(a - c)`).
3. **Odd and Even Differences**:
   - If the difference is odd, it calculates the possible column range for Alice's moves (`l` and `r`).
   - It then checks if Bob's column position falls within this range plus an additional move (`x + 1`).
   - If so, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
   - If the difference is even, it follows a similar logic but with Bob's column range.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the column positions might go out of bounds by using `max` and `min` functions.

Given the problem description and the examples provided, the program correctly identifies the outcomes for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
