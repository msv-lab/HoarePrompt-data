### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - It then reads the dimensions of the board (`r`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`).

2. **Basic Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if Alice's row position (`a`) is greater than Bob's row position (`c`). If true, it directly prints "Draw". This condition is correct because if Alice is already below Bob, Bob can never catch up, so the game is a draw.

3. **Detailed Logic for Winning Conditions**:
   - The logic calculates the difference in row positions (`abs(a - c)`).
   - If this difference is odd, it calculates the possible range for Alice's chip (`l` and `r`) based on the middle point between Alice and Bob.
   - It then checks if Bob's column position (`b`) falls within this range plus one extra cell to account for diagonal moves. If it does, Alice can win; otherwise, it's a draw.
   - If the difference is even, it calculates the possible range for Bob's chip similarly and checks if Alice's column position (`d`) falls within this range. If it does, Bob can win; otherwise, it's a draw.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the calculated ranges might extend beyond the board boundaries (using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)`).
   - The logic seems to cover most scenarios, but we need to ensure it handles all edge cases properly.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program uses `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition])` to format the output, which is correct for the given problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
