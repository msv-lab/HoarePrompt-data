Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to find the maximum and minimum values across all arrays and calculates the difference between them, which is not the correct approach for maximizing the beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). 

To maximize this, we should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Sorting ensures that the largest differences are used, thereby maximizing the beauty.

The provided solution instead finds the maximum and minimum values in each array and prints their difference, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty as defined.

Correctness: **False**
