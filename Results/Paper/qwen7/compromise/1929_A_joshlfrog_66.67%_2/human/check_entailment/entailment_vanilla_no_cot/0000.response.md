Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. The logic in the function only finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n.

To solve this problem correctly, you should consider rearranging the array such that the largest numbers are placed alternately with the smallest numbers to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the beauty based on the differences between adjacent elements after a specific rearrangement.
