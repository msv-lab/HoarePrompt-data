Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 0, `l` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list of integers split from the input, `x` is equal to `nums[i]`**.

The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `x`. Since `i` is initially set to 1, `x` is now equal to the first element of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
