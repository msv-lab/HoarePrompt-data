Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is `nums[i]`, `y` is equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than `y`, and `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. Since `i` was already `i + 1`, it remains unchanged. The value of `e` and `l` remain the same as they were not affected by the code. The value of `x` is now `nums[i]`, and `y` remains equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is less than `y`. The list `nums` and its creation process from the input string are also unchanged.
