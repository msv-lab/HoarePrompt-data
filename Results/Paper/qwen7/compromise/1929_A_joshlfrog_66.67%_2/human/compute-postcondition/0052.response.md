Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is the maximum value among `nums[0]` to `nums[i]` (inclusive), `y` is equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is greater than `y`, and `y` is now `nums[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. Since `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string, and `i` is `i + 1`, the value of `y` is updated to be `nums[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
