Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `e` will be equal to `t-1`, `l` will be the total length of the list `nums` for each iteration, `i` will be `l-1`, `x` will be the maximum value found across all lists `nums` during the iterations, and `y` will be the minimum value found across all lists `nums` during the iterations.

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `e` will have reached `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. For each iteration, `l` is set to the length of the input list `nums`, `i` iterates from `0` to `l-1`, updating `x` to the highest value and `y` to the lowest value in each list `nums`. The final values of `x` and `y` will be the overall maximum and minimum values found across all the lists `nums` provided as inputs during the loop's execution.
