Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, `e` is 0, `l` is the total length of the list `nums`, `i` is `l-1`, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `l-1`, as the loop runs from `0` to `l-1`. The variable `x` will hold the maximum value found in the list `nums` because it gets updated whenever a value in `nums[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`. Similarly, the variable `y` will hold the minimum value found in the list `nums` because it gets updated whenever a value in `nums[i]` is smaller than the current value of `y`. All other variables (`t`, `e`, and `l`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
