Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `l` as the variables involved in the loop condition `i in range(l)`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < l`.

3. **Current State of Variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500.
   - `e` is 1.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `i` is `l-1`.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is 100000000.
   - `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string.

4. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `l`. Given that `i` is currently `l-1`, the loop will not execute because `i` is already equal to `l-1`, making `i` not less than `l`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `l` for the loop to execute. This means `i` should be set to a value less than `l`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is less than `l` for the loop to start executing.
   - Since `l` is an input integer, we cannot directly adjust it. However, we can adjust `i` to a value less than `l`.

Given this analysis, the necessary adjustments are:

- `i` should be less than `l`.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is less than `l`, `e` is 1, `l` is an input integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string**.
