Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Specifically, the program does not consider all possible paths from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell and does not ensure that the string is constructed correctly according to the rules.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
1101
1100
8
00100111
11101101
```

The expected output should be:
```
11000
1
001001101
4
```

However, the program will produce incorrect results. For instance, in the second test case, the program constructs the string `11000` but does not account for the possibility of constructing the lexicographically smallest string `001001101` with 4 different paths. The program's logic for constructing the string and counting the paths is flawed and does not handle all possible paths correctly.
