Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly separates the password into letters and digits.
2. It checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. It checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. It ensures that there are no instances where a letter is followed immediately by a digit.

However, there are some issues in the logic:
- The function does not check if there are any digits that come after a letter. This is a critical part of the problem statement.
- The function assumes that the first and last letters being the same is necessary, which is not explicitly required in the problem statement.
- The function does not handle the case where the password consists only of digits or only of letters.

To fix these issues, we need to add the following checks:
- Ensure that there are no digits after a letter.
- Check if the password consists only of letters or only of digits.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    
    # Check if there are any digits after a letter
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    
    # Check if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    
    # Check if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    
    # Check if the password consists only of letters or only of digits
    if not letters and not digits:
        return 'NO'
    
    return 'YES'
```

Given the above corrections, the original program is incorrect because it does not fully adhere to the problem requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
