Output State: **`i` is 22; `ind` is `ind` + 2; `n` must be greater than 22; `p[i]` is assigned the value `ind` + 2.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 22. The variable `ind` is incremented by 2, so its new value is `ind` + 2. The condition that `n` must be greater than 22 remains unchanged. Additionally, `p[i]` is reassigned to the new value of `ind` + 2 since `i` is still 22.
