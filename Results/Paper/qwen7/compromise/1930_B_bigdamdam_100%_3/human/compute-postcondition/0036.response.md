Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `p` is a list of length `n` with elements [0, 0, ..., 0, `n-3` (which is `ind`)], `ind` is `n-3`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p[i]` to `ind`, which is `n-3`. Given the initial state, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `p` is a list of length `n` with all elements as `0` except for the element at index `i` which is `n-2` (which is `ind`), and `ind` is `n-3`. After executing `p[i] = ind`, the element at index `i` in list `p` changes from `n-2` to `n-3`. All other variables remain unchanged.
