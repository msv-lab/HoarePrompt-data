Output State: `i` is 22, `ind` is 26, `n` is greater than 22, `p[12]` is 19, `p[14]` is 12, `p[16]` is 10, `p[18]` is 20, `p[20]` is 22, `p[22]` is 24.

Explanation: The loop runs for as long as `i` is less than `n` with a step of 2. Given that the loop executes 3 times initially and each iteration increments `i` by 2 and `ind` by 2, we can deduce that the loop will continue until `i` reaches 22 (since it starts from 18 and increments by 2 each time). At this point, `ind` would have been incremented 7 times starting from 20 (as it was 20 after the 3rd iteration), making it 26. Therefore, `p[i]` will be assigned the value of `ind` at each even index starting from 12 up to 22, resulting in the specified values for `p`.
