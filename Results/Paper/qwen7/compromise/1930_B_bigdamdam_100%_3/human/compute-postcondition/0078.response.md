Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop starts from 1 and increments `i` by 2 each time until `i` is no longer less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 20.
   - `ind` is `ind` + 2 (This variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not affect the loop execution).

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 2, the next value of `i` would be `i + 2 = 22`.

5. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now 22, `n` must be greater than 22.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to 22.
   - `n` must be greater than 22.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 22, `n` must be greater than 22**
