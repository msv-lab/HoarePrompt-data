Let's break down the initial state and the logic of the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 22.
   - `ind` is 26.
   - `n` is greater than 22.
   - `p[12]` is 19.
   - `p[14]` is 12.
   - `p[16]` is 10.
   - `p[18]` is 20.
   - `p[20]` is 22.
   - `p[22]` is 24.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n` with a step of 2.
   - Initially, `i` is 18 (since it starts from 18 and increments by 2 each time).
   - The loop will execute 3 times initially (from 18 to 22).

3. **Increment Logic**:
   - Each iteration, `i` is incremented by 2 and `ind` is incremented by 2.
   - After the 3rd iteration, `i` becomes 22 and `ind` becomes 26.

4. **Assignments**:
   - At each even index starting from 12 up to 22, `p[i]` is assigned the value of `ind`.
   - This means:
     - `p[18]` is assigned 26.
     - `p[20]` is assigned 26.
     - `p[22]` is assigned 26.

Given these steps, the final values of `p` will be:
- `p[12]` is 19.
- `p[14]` is 12.
- `p[16]` is 10.
- `p[18]` is 26.
- `p[20]` is 26.
- `p[22]` is 26.

Therefore, the output when `print(*p)` is executed will be the unpacked values of the list `p`.

Output: **19 12 10 26 26 26**
