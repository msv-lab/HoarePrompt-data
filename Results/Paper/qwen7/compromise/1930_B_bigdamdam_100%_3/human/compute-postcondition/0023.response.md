Output State: **`i` is `5 + n % 2`, `p[i]` is `ind + 6`, `ind` is `ind + 4`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is calculated as `5 + n % 2`.
- `p[i]` is set to `ind + 2`.
- `ind` is updated to `ind + 4`.

After executing `p[i] = ind`, `p[i]` is now equal to `ind + 4`. Since `ind` was previously `ind + 4`, the new value of `p[i]` is `ind + 4`, which is equivalent to `ind + 6` because `ind` was already `ind + 2` before the assignment. Therefore, the updated values are:
- `i` remains `5 + n % 2`.
- `p[i]` is now `ind + 6`.
- `ind` remains `ind + 4`.
