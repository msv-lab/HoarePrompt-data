Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `i` in steps of 2 from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `p` is a list where an element at index `i+2` is assigned the value `ind-2`.
   - The element at index `i` in list `p` is now `ind`.
   - `ind` is decreased by 2.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, if `i` was the last even number less than `n` in the previous iteration, the next `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 2 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to continue.
   - `p` and `ind` will be updated according to the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they follow the same pattern as described.

Given the above points, let's determine the new state:

- If `i` was the last even number less than `n` in the previous iteration, the next `i` will be `i + 2`.
- `n` must still be at least 2.
- `p` and `ind` will be updated according to the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they follow the same pattern as described.

Assuming `i` was the largest even number less than `n` in the previous iteration, the next `i` will be `i + 2`.

Therefore, the new state should reflect that `i` is incremented by 2 and `n` remains the same.

**State: **`n` must be at least 2; `p` is a list where an element at index `i+2` is assigned the value `ind-2`; the element at index `i` in list `p` is now `ind`; `ind` is decreased by 2; `i` is incremented by 2**
