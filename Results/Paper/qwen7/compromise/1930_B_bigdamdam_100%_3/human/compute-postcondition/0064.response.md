Output State: **`ind` is `n-2`, `i` is 14, `p[i]` is `ind`**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` (which is `n-2`) to the element `p[i]` where `i` is 14. The values of `ind` and `i` remain unchanged, but now `p[14]` holds the value of `ind`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 14 is still valid.
