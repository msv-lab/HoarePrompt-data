Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and the input value, which determines the upper limit of the loop.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `ind` is 12
   - `i` is 10
   - `p[1]` is 1
   - `p[4]` is 2
   - `p[6]` is 4
   - `p[9]` is 6

3. **Loop Pattern**: The loop starts with `i` as 1 and increments by 2 each iteration. The loop runs until `i` reaches the input value (`n`).

4. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 10, the next value of `i` will be 12.
   - The input value (`n`) must be 11 because the loop runs until `i` is just below or equal to `n`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 12.
   - `ind` will be updated based on the number of iterations. Since `i` has incremented from 10 to 12, it means the loop has completed one more iteration. Therefore, `ind` should be updated to `12 * 2 / 2 = 12 + 2 = 14`.
   - `p[12]` will be set to 12.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ind` is 14, `i` is 12, `p[1]` is 1, `p[4]` is 2, `p[6]` is 4, `p[9]` is 6, `p[12]` is 12**
