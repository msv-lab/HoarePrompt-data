Based on the initial state provided:

- `ind` is 12.
- `i` is 10.
- `p[1]` is 1.
- `p[4]` is 2.
- `p[6]` is 4.
- `p[9]` is 6.

We need to determine the values of the list `p` after the loop has executed. From the information given, we can infer the following:

1. The loop starts with `i` as 1 and increments by 2 each iteration.
2. `ind` starts at 2 and increases by 2 each time it is incremented inside the loop.
3. The loop runs until `i` reaches `n`.

Given that `ind` is 12 and `i` is 10, we can deduce that the loop has completed 5 iterations (since `ind` increases by 2 each time, and `ind` is now 12, meaning it has increased by 2 five times from its initial value of 2). This implies that `i` has reached 9 (since it starts at 1 and increments by 2 each time, 1 + 2*4 = 9, and the next increment would make it 11, but the loop stops before reaching `n`).

The values of `p` are given for indices 1, 4, 6, and 9. Since the loop increments `ind` by 2 each time and sets `p[ind]` to `ind * 2`, we can fill in the missing values:

- `p[1] = 1 * 2 = 2` (given as 1, but should be 2 based on the pattern).
- `p[2] = 2 * 2 = 4`.
- `p[3] = 3 * 2 = 6`.
- `p[4] = 4 * 2 = 8` (given as 2, but should be 8 based on the pattern).
- `p[5] = 5 * 2 = 10`.
- `p[6] = 6 * 2 = 12` (given as 4, but should be 12 based on the pattern).
- `p[7] = 7 * 2 = 14`.
- `p[8] = 8 * 2 = 16`.
- `p[9] = 9 * 2 = 18` (given as 6, but should be 18 based on the pattern).

Therefore, the list `p` after the loop has executed is `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]`.

The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Output: **2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18**
