Output State: **`ind` is `n`, `i` is 12, `p`[12] is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` (which is `n`) to the index `i` (which is 12) in the list `p`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
