Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`. Given the increment step is `2`, the loop will continue until `i` reaches or exceeds `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 18
   - `n` must be at least 19
   - `p[12]` must be at least 19 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not affect the loop execution)
   - `p[18]` is `ind` (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not affect the loop execution)
   - `ind` is 20 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not affect the loop execution)

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, the next value of `i` will be `18 + 2 = 20`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 20 and `n` must be at least 19, `n` must be greater than 20.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 20, `n` must be greater than 20**
