Output State: `i` is 22, `ind` is 26, `n` must be greater than 22, `p[12]` is 19, `p[14]` is 12, `p[16]` is 10, `p[18]` is 20, `p[20]` is 22, `p[22]` is 24.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `n-1` with a step of 2. Given the initial state where `ind` is 2 and `i` is 18, the loop will continue until `i` exceeds `n-1`. After 3 iterations, `i` becomes 22 and `ind` becomes 26. During each iteration, `p[i]` is set to the current value of `ind`, and `ind` is incremented by 2. Therefore, `p[18]` is set to 20 (from the first iteration), `p[20]` is set to 22 (from the second iteration), and `p[22]` is set to 24 (from the third iteration). Since the loop continues until `i` is no longer less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 22 for the loop to complete its iterations.
