Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `p` is a list of n zeros, `ind` is `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ind`. The values of `t` and `p` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, `n` retains its original value as the first integer from the input split by spaces, `p` remains a list of `n` zeros, and `ind` is now equal to `n`.
