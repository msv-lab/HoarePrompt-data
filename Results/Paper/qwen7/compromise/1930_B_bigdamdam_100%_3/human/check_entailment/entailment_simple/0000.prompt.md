Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n

        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):

    #State: Output State: The loop runs until `i` reaches the highest odd number less than `n` or `i` equals `n` if `n` is even. After all iterations, `ind` will be `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (number of iterations)`, and `i` will be the highest odd number less than `n` or `n` if `n` is even. The list `p` will contain values such that `p[i]` for even indices is `ind + 2 * (number of iterations / 2)` and for odd indices is `ind + 2 * ((number of iterations + 1) / 2)`.
    #
    #To calculate the exact output state after the loop completes all iterations:
    #- `i` will be the largest odd number less than `n` if `n` is even, otherwise `n-1` if `n` is odd.
    #- `ind` will be `1 + n % 2 + 2 * (number of iterations)`, which simplifies to `1 + n % 2 + n // 2` since the number of iterations is `n // 2` if `n` is even and `(n - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd.
    #- The list `p` will be filled such that for even indices, `p[i] = ind + 2 * (i // 2)`, and for odd indices, `p[i] = ind + 2 * ((i + 1) // 2)`.
    #
    #For example, if `n` is 11:
    #- `i` will be 10 (the largest odd number less than 11).
    #- `ind` will be `1 + 11 % 2 + 11 // 2 = 1 + 1 + 5 = 7`.
    #- The list `p` will be filled as follows:
    #  - `p[0] = 7`
    #  - `p[1] = 9`
    #  - `p[2] = 11`
    #  - `p[3] = 13`
    #  - `p[4] = 15`
    #  - `p[5] = 17`
    #  - `p[6] = 19`
    #  - `p[7] = 21`
    #  - `p[8] = 23`
    #  - `p[9] = 25`
    #  - `p[10] = 27`
    #
    #Therefore, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:
    #Output State: `i` is 10, `ind` is 7, `n` is 11, `p[0]` is 7, `p[1]` is 9, `p[2]` is 11, `p[3]` is 13, `p[4]` is 15, `p[5]` is 17, `p[6]` is 19, `p[7]` is 21, `p[8]` is 23, `p[9]` is 25, `p[10]` is 27.
