### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` (length of the permutation).

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The code constructs a permutation `p` of length `n` using a specific pattern.
   - It initializes an empty list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses two loops to fill the list `p`:
     - The first loop fills the even indices with decreasing values starting from `n` down to `n//2 + 1`.
     - The second loop fills the odd indices with increasing values starting from `n//2 + 1 + 1` up to `n`.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - For even indices `i` (0-based), `p[i] = ind`, where `ind` starts at `n` and decreases by 2 in each iteration.
   - For odd indices `i`, `p[i] = ind`, where `ind` starts at `n//2 + 2` and increases by 2 in each iteration.

4. **Divisibility Check**:
   - The constructed permutation ensures that no two elements `p[i]` and `p[j]` (with `i < j`) satisfy the condition that both `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`.
   - This is because the even indices are filled with larger numbers in descending order, and the odd indices are filled with smaller numbers in ascending order. This pattern prevents any pair of consecutive elements from satisfying the divisibility condition.

5. **Output**:
   - The code prints the permutation `p` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the code correctly constructs a permutation that satisfies the problem's requirements. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
