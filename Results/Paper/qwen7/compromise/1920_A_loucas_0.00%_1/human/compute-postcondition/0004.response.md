Output State: **`loop` must be greater than or equal to 1; `less` is an empty list; `big` is an empty list; `no` is an empty list.**

The code `no = []` creates a new empty list and assigns it to the variable `no`. The values of the other variables (`loop`, `less`, and `big`) remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
