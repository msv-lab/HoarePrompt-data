Postcondition: `x` is an input integer, `a` is either appended to the list `big`, `less`, or `no`, `iterable2` is 1, and `innerLoop` is greater than 0. If `x` equals 1, then `a` is appended to `big`. If `x` equals 2, then `a` is appended to `less`. Otherwise, `a` is updated to the second integer input and appended to `no`.
