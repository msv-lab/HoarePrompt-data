Output State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Given the initial conditions, these remain unchanged except for the fact that the loop or conditional block has been exited.
