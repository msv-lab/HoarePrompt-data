Output State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is a list containing `a`, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `x` is 1.**

The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` (which is an input integer) to the list `big`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
