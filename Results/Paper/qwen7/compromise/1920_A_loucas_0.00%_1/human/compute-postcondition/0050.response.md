Output State: **`i` is `min(less)`, `num` is `min(less)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block present in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i` and `num`. The `break` statement only indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block we were inside, which in this context means the initial state remains unchanged.
