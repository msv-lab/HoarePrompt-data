Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `innerLoop` is an input integer, `i` is `min(less) + 2`, `num` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `x` and `a` will depend on the inputs provided during the next iteration, `no` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `i` is `min(less) + 2`, `num` is 0, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `x` is either 1 or an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, and `iterable2` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `i` is `min(less) + 2`, `num` is 0, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is either a list containing `a` or an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, and `iterable2` is 1. If `x` equals 1, then `big` is a list containing `a`. If `x` equals 2, then `no` remains as either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`. Otherwise, `no` becomes a list containing `[a]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `innerLoop` must be greater than 1, `i` is `min(less) + 2`, `num` is 0, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is either a list containing `a` or an empty list, `x` is the first input integer, `a` is the second input integer, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, and `iterable2` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
