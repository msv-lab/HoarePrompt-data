Output State: **`i` is an integer within the range `min(less)` to `max(big) - 1`, `num` is equal to `i`, and `i` is not in the set `no`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that we exit the current context (which could be a loop or an if statement). The values of `i`, `num`, and the condition regarding the set `no` remain unchanged.
