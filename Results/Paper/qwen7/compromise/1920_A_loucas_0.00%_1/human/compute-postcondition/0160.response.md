Output State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `num` is equal to `i`, and `i not in no` must still hold true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables remain the same as the initial state, except for the fact that the loop or if statement is exited.
