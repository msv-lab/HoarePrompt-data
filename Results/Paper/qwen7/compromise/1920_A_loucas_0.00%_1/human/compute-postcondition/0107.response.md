Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `i` must be within the range `[max(big), min(less))`, `less` must contain at least 3 integers, `no` must contain at least 3 integers, `big` must contain at least 1 integer. If `i` is not in `no`, then `num` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
