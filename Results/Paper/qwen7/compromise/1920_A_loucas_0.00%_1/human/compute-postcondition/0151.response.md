Output State: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing inputs for all `x` where `x` was 2, `big` is a list containing inputs for all `x` where `x` was 1, `no` is a list containing inputs for all `x` where `x` was 3, `num` is 0, and `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer. After all iterations, `iterable2` will have gone through every value from 0 to `innerLoop - 1`, and based on the value of `x` for each iteration, `less`, `big`, and `no` lists will be populated accordingly.
