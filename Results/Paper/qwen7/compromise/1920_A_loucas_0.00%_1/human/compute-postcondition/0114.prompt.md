Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `i` is `min(less) + 2`, `num` is 0, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing up to three integers, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing up to three integers, `x` is the third input integer, `a` is the fourth input integer, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing up to three integers, and `iterable2` is 2.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `innerLoop` should be greater than 2 (since we know it has executed at least 3 times). The variables `i`, `num`, `less`, `big`, `x`, `a`, and `no` will contain the state they had after the last iteration of the loop, and `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop - 1`, which is 2 in this case. The lists `less`, `big`, and `no` can each contain up to three integers depending on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    if i not in no:
        num = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `i` is currently `num`, `less` must contain at least 3 integers, `no` must contain at least 3 integers, `big` must contain at least 1 integer. If the current value of `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `i not in no` is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `i` must be within the range `[max(big), min(less))`, `less` must contain at least 3 integers, `no` must contain at least 3 integers, `big` must contain at least 1 integer. If `i` is not in `no`, then `num` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `i` is either within the range `[max(big), min(less)) + 1)` and not in `no`, or `i` is equal to `num` and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, `less` must contain at least 3 integers, `no` must contain at least 3 integers, and `big` must contain at least 1 integer.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
