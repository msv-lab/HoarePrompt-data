Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It then reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\):
     ```python
     nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
     ```
   - This creates a list of integers: `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^20]`.

3. **Finding the Appropriate Index:**
   - The program iterates through `nums` to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`:
     ```python
     idx = -1
     for i in range(len(nums)):
         if nums[i] > k:
             idx = i - 1
             break
     ```
   - If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^{20}\), `idx` will be the index of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Adjusting the List:**
   - The program appends new values to `nums`:
     ```python
     nums.append(k - nums[idx])
     nums.append(k + 1)
     nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
     ```
   - It removes the element at the found index:
     ```python
     nums.remove(1 << idx)
     ```

5. **Output:**
   - The length of the modified `nums` list is printed.
   - The elements of `nums` are printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - The value `k - nums[idx]` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`. This is because `k - nums[idx]` is constructed to avoid any combination that could sum to `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
   - The values `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`, and the remaining powers of 2 ensure that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed as subsequences.
   - The construction guarantees that every integer from 1 to `n` can be represented as a sum of some subset of the modified `nums`.

3. **Sequence Size Constraint:**
   - The sequence size is at most 25, which is satisfied by the construction method.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly constructs a sequence that meets all the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
