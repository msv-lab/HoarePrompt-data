You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations will include `i` being 21, `idx` being 19, and `nums` being a list containing all powers of 2 from \(2\) up to \(1048576\), plus \(k-1048576\), \(k+1\), and \(k+1048576+1\), with the element \(1048576\) removed. The exact content of `nums` depends on the value of `k`, but it will always include the numbers \(2, 4, 8, \ldots, 1048576, k-1048576, k+1, k+1048576+1\), excluding \(1048576\).
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `nums` will contain all powers of 2 from \(2\) to \(1048576\) inclusive, along with three additional numbers derived from `k`: \(k-1048576\), \(k+1\), and \(k+1048576+1\), with the number \(1048576\) removed from the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\). It then constructs a list `nums` containing all powers of 2 from \(2\) to \(1048576\) inclusive, along with three additional numbers derived from \(k\): \(k-1048576\), \(k+1\), and \(k+1048576+1\), with the number \(1048576\) removed from the list. Finally, it prints the length of the list `nums` followed by the elements of `nums`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a sequence `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Specifically, the program generates a sequence that includes values larger than `k`, which violates the condition that there should be no subsequence of `a` with a sum equal to `k`.

For example, consider the test case `n = 8` and `k = 8`. The program generates the sequence `[2147483647, 134217727, 8388607, 524287, 32768, 20971, 13107, 8191, 5120, 3072, 1920, 1280, 896, 640, 448, 320, 224, 160, 112, 72, 56, 40, 28, 24, 20, 16, 12, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0]`. This sequence includes the value `8`, which means there is a subsequence with a sum of `8`, violating the requirement that no subsequence should sum to `k`.

To meet the problem's requirements, the sequence should avoid including values that could lead to a subsequence summing to `k`. The current implementation does not ensure this, making the program incorrect.
