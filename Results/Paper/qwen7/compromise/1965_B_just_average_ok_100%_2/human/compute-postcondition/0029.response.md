Output State: **`i` is 2, `idx` is 1, `nums` is a list with elements [2, k + 1], `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The values of `i` and `idx` remain unchanged, and the list `nums` remains as `[2, k + 1]`. The new variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the integers input by the user.
