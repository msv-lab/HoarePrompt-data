State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is -1, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `len(nums)` must be at least 1** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is set to 21, but the loop will start from `i = 0` to `i < len(nums)`.
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `nums`.
- Since `nums` is a list containing 21 elements, the length of `nums` is 21.
- For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(nums)`, which is 21.
- Therefore, the initial value of `i` (21) is not within the range required for the loop to execute. We need to adjust `i` to be less than `len(nums)`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is within the valid range for the loop to execute, and `nums` must have at least one element.
