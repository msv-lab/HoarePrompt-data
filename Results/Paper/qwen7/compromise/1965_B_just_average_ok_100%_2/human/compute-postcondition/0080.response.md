Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 21 (though `i` is not used in the print statement).
- `idx` is 19 (though `idx` is not used in the print statement).
- `k` is greater than 0 (though `k` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer (though `n` is not used in the print statement).
- `nums` is a list containing the values [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194305].

The print statement `print(*nums)` will unpack the list `nums` and print each element separated by a space.

Output: **2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2097152 4194305**
