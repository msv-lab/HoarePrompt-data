Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 20, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], the current value of `nums[idx]` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is updated to `i - 1`, which means `idx` is now 20 (since `i` was 21). All other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, since `nums[i]` was greater than `k` before the operation, `nums[idx]` (which is now `nums[20]`) must be less than or equal to `k` because `nums[21]` is greater than `k` and `nums` is a list of powers of 2 in ascending order.
