You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations will include `i` being 21, `idx` being 19, and `nums` being a list containing all powers of 2 from \(2\) up to \(1048576\), plus \(k-1048576\), \(k+1\), and \(k+1048576+1\), with the element \(1048576\) removed. The exact content of `nums` depends on the value of `k`, but it will always include the numbers \(2, 4, 8, \ldots, 1048576, k-1048576, k+1, k+1048576+1\), excluding \(1048576\).
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `nums` will contain all powers of 2 from \(2\) to \(1048576\) inclusive, along with three additional numbers derived from `k`: \(k-1048576\), \(k+1\), and \(k+1048576+1\), with the number \(1048576\) removed from the list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each t, two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) are provided. The function returns different values based on the conditions specified for n and k.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
