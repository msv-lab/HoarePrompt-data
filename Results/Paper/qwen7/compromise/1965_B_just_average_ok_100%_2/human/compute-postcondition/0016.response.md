Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(nums))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `idx` is 0
   - The postcondition is that if `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, the loop breaks.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(nums)`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` would be 2.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `idx` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The new state should reflect that `i` is now 2, and `idx` remains 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `idx` is 0**
