Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 19, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194305]**.

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `nums`. The new element is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Given that `idx` is 19, `nums[idx]` is `nums[19]`, which is `k + 1` (from the initial state). So, the new element becomes `k + (k + 1) + 1 = 2k + 2`. Since `k` is greater than 0, `2k + 2` is a positive integer. The updated list `nums` now contains all its original elements plus the new element `2k + 2`.
