Output State: **`i` is 0, `idx` is -1, `nums` is a list with elements [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variable values but instead exits the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or modified by the `break` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The only effect is that the loop or conditional block is exited.
