Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` because `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` each iteration until it reaches `n`.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`**:
   - From the postcondition, we know that `i` can either be `2` (if it was `1`) or `4` (if it was `3`). This means that `i` has incremented by `1` from its previous value.

4. **Determine the New Value of `n`**:
   - The postcondition also states that `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Since `i` is now `2` or `4`, `n` must be greater than `2` or `4` respectively.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `2` if it was `1` or `4` if it was `3`.
   - `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2 or 4, `n` must be greater than 2 or 4 respectively, `answer` contains the element `array[a[-1] - 1]` appended to it if `i` was odd, or the element `array[a[0] + 1]` appended to it if `i` was even.**
