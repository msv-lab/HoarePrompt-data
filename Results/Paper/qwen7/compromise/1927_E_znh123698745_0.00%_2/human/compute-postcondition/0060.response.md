Output State: **The final state of the loop will have `i` equal to `n`, `a` as a list with two elements where `a[0]` is `n` and `a[-1]` is 1, `array` remains unchanged, and `answer` is a list containing `n` elements. The elements in `answer` alternate between the last remaining element of `array` (as `a[-1]` decreases) and the first element of `array` (as `a[0]` increases).**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. At each iteration, if `(-1)^i == -1`, the last element of `a` (`a[-1]`) is decremented and the corresponding element from `array` is appended to `answer`. If `(-1)^i == 1`, the first element of `a` (`a[0]`) is incremented and the corresponding element from `array` is appended to `answer`. This process continues until `i` reaches `n`, at which point `a[-1]` would have reached 1 and `a[0]` would have reached `n`, resulting in `a` being `[n, 1]`. The `answer` list will contain elements from both ends of `array`, alternating between the end and the start, until all elements are included.
