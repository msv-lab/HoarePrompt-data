Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[-1]]`**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element from `array` at the index given by `a[-1]` to the list `answer`. However, the initial values and conditions of `i`, `n`, and `a` are not provided, so we only know that `i` remains 3 and `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `answer` now has one more element than before, which is the value from `array` at the index specified by `a[-1]`.
