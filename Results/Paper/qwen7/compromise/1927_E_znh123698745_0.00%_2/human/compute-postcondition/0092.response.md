Output State: The final state of the loop will be such that `i` equals `n`, `answer` is a list that contains elements from the `array` based on the conditions inside the loop, and both `a[0]` and `a[-1]` will have been adjusted according to the loop's operations.

To elaborate, after all iterations of the loop:
- `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
- `answer` will contain elements from `array` as follows:
  - If `i` was odd during any iteration, `array[a[-1]]` was appended to `answer` and `a[-1]` was decremented by 1.
  - If `i` was even during any iteration, `array[a[0]]` was appended to `answer` and `a[0]` was incremented by 1.
- Both `a[0]` and `a[-1]` will be adjusted such that `a[-1]` will be `1` (since it starts at `n+1` and gets decremented until it reaches `1`) and `a[0]` will be `n` (since it starts at `1` and gets incremented until it reaches `n`).
