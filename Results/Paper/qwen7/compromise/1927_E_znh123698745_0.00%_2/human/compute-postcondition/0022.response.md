Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - The postcondition includes the logic inside the loop.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `(-1) ** i` equals -1 (which is true when `i` is even, like 2), then `answer` is updated with the element at index `array[a[-1] - 1]`.
   - Otherwise, `a[0]` is increased by 1, and `array[a[0]]` is appended to `answer`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - Since `i` is 2, the condition `(-1) ** i == -1` is true.
   - Therefore, `answer` is updated with the element at index `array[a[-1] - 1]`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`, the next value of `i` should be 3 if `n` is greater than 3.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - No other states need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**
