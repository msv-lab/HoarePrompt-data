Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive). This means `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n + 1`.
   - `a` is a list `[1, -1]`.
   - `answer` is a list `[1]`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `array` is a list containing integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Determine Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within the range of 1 to `n-1`. Since `i` is initially set to `n + 1`, this value is outside the valid range for the loop to execute.
   - Therefore, `i` must be adjusted to a value within the range [1, n-1].

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The initial value of `i` (`n + 1`) needs to be changed to a value within the range [1, n-1] for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`a`, `answer`, `n`, `k`, and `array`) do not affect the loop condition and do not need adjustment.

Based on the above reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` must be within the range [1, n-1]**.
