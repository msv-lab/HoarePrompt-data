Output State: **`i` is \(n\), `a` is a list with its first element increased by 1, `array` is a predefined list, `answer` is a list with the first element being `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the first element of the list `a` by 1. The initial value of `a[0]` was `i`, which is \(n-1\). After the increment, `a[0]` becomes \(n-1+1 = n\). The other variables (`array` and `answer`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` remains \(n-1\) but is now referred to as \(n\) in the output state, and `a`'s first element is updated to \(n\).
