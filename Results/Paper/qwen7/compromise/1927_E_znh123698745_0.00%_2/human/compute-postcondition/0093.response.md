Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`.
- `answer` will contain elements from `array` based on the conditions inside the loop:
  - If `i` was odd during any iteration, `array[a[-1]]` was appended to `answer` and `a[-1]` was decremented by 1.
  - If `i` was even during any iteration, `array[a[0]]` was appended to `answer` and `a[0]` was incremented by 1.
- Both `a[0]` and `a[-1]` will be adjusted such that `a[-1]` will be `1` and `a[0]` will be `n`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the elements of `answer`:

- Initially, `a[0]` is `1` and `a[-1]` is `n+1`.
- During each iteration of the loop, if `i` is odd, `array[n+1]` (which is `array[a[-1]]`) is appended to `answer` and `a[-1]` is decremented by 1.
- If `i` is even, `array[1]` (which is `array[a[0]]`) is appended to `answer` and `a[0]` is incremented by 1.
- This process continues until `i` becomes `n`.

Since `a[-1]` starts at `n+1` and is decremented by 1 each time `i` is odd, it will eventually reach `1` after `n` iterations. Similarly, `a[0]` starts at `1` and is incremented by 1 each time `i` is even, so it will also reach `n` after `n` iterations.

During each iteration, `array[a[-1]]` (or `array[a[0]]`) is appended to `answer`, and since `a[-1]` and `a[0]` cycle through the indices of `array` from `n+1` to `1` and back to `1` to `n`, respectively, `answer` will contain every element of `array` exactly once.

Therefore, `answer` will be a list containing all elements of `array` in some order, but since each element is appended exactly once, the order doesn't matter for the final output.

Output: **array[1], array[2], ..., array[n]**
