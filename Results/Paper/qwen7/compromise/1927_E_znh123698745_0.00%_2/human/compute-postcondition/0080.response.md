Output State: **`i` is 2 (if `i` was 1), `i` is 4 (if `i` was 3), etc., `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `answer` contains the element `array[a[0]]` appended to it if `i` was even.**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`. The precondition states that `answer` will contain the last element of `array` appended to it if `i` was odd, or the element `array[a[0]]` appended to it if `i` was even. Since the code specifies appending `array[a[0]]`, it means `i` must have been even before this line of code was executed. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
