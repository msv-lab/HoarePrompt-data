Output State: **`i` is an integer such that \((-1\) raised to the power of `i` equals -1\); `answer` is a list with one additional element which is `array[a[-1] - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Given that `(-1)` raised to the power of `i` equals -1, `i` must be an odd integer. The value of `answer` remains unchanged, but its last element changes from `array[a[-1]]` to `array[a[-1] - 1]` because `a[-1]` is decremented by 1.
