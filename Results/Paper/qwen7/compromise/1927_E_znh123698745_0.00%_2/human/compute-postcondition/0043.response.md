Output State: **`i` is an integer, and \((-1)^i\) is equal to 1; `a[0]` is increased by 1; `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is an integer, and since \((-1)^i\) is equal to 1, `i` must be an even number. The value of `a[0]` is incremented by 1. The `answer` list has an element appended from `array[a[0]]`, which means `answer` now contains an additional element from the array starting at index `a[0]`.
