Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of problems available (`n`), the number of rounds (`m`), and the string of difficulty levels (`a`). It then calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed using the `func_1` function, which counts the occurrences of each difficulty level and determines how many more are needed to meet the requirement for `m` rounds. The logic in `func_1` is sound and matches the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
