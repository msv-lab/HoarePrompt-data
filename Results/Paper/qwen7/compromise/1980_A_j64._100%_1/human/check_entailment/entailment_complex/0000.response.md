Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the string `a`.
- It then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to ensure there are at least `m` problems for each round.
- The calculation `needed_problems += m - count[i]` ensures that if the current count of a difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference to `needed_problems`.
- The function returns the total `needed_problems`, which is the sum of all differences for each difficulty level.
- This logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
