Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the number of rounds `m`, and the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems.
3. The function `func_1` is called with `n`, `m`, and `a` as arguments.
4. In `func_1`, the program initializes an array `count` of size 7 to zero, which will be used to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
5. It iterates over each character in the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` array.
6. After counting the problems, it calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level by comparing the current count with the required number of rounds `m`.
7. If the count for a difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.
8. Finally, it returns the total number of additional problems needed.

Given the logic and implementation, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can hold `m` rounds with at least one problem of each difficulty level.

Correctness: **True**
