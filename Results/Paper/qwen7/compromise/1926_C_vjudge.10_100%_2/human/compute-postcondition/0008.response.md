Output State: **`sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of the next character in the string representation of `i`, `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is now the original value plus the integer value of `x`.**

This means that the value of `sum_value_digits` has been updated by adding the integer value of the character `x` (which is the next character in the string representation of `i`). The variable `x` remains unchanged, holding the next character in the string representation of `i`.
