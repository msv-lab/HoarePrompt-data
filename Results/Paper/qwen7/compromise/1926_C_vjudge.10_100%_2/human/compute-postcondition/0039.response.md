Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 200001.
- `value` is an input integer.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(values[value])
```

Here, `values` is a variable whose type and content are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since no specific definition or value for `values` is given, we cannot determine the exact value that will be printed. Therefore, the output will depend on the actual content of `values` and the value of `value`.

Output: **values[value] (where `values` is an undefined list and `value` is an input integer)**
