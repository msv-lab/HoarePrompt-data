Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`
- `sum_value_digits` contains the sum of all digits in the final value of `i`

### Loop Head
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, inf):`

### Analysis
- The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes to infinity (`inf`), meaning it will continue indefinitely as long as `i` is incremented.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue is simply that `i` keeps increasing without bound.

### Adjusting States
- Since the loop continues as long as `i` keeps increasing, the only thing that changes in each iteration is the value of `i`.
- The value of `sum_value_digits` is derived from the current value of `i`, but it does not change within the loop itself; it is recomputed based on the new value of `i` at the start of each iteration.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`.
- In the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Given this, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i`.

### Updated State
- `values[i]` will now be computed using `i = k + 1`.
- `sum_value_digits` will be recomputed based on the new value of `i`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`values[i]` is equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, and `sum_value_digits` contains the sum of all digits in the final value of `i + 1`**
