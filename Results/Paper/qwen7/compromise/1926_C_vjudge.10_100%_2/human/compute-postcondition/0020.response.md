Output State: **`sum_value_digits` is the original value plus twice the integer value of the first character of the previous `i` plus the integer value of the first character of the current `i`, `i` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than the previous iteration)**.

Explanation: The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` adds the integer value of the first character of the current `i` to `sum_value_digits`. Here, `x` represents the first character of the current `i`. The initial condition states that `sum_value_digits` is the original value plus twice the integer value of the first character of the previous `i`. Therefore, after executing the code, `sum_value_digits` is updated to include the integer value of the first character of the current `i`. The length of `i` remains one character shorter than the previous iteration.
