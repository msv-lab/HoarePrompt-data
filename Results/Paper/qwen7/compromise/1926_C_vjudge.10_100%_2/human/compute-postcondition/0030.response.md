Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each character `x` in the string `i`. Therefore, the relevant variables in the loop head are `x` and `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body Effects**:
   - `sum_value_digits` is updated by adding the integer value of `x` to it.
   - `sum_value_digits` was already increased by the integer value of `x` at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Determine the New State**:
   - Since `x` is the current character being processed in the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next character in the string `i`.
   - `sum_value_digits` will be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus the integer value of the current `x`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers.
- `sum_value_digits` is the sum of `int(x)` plus the integer value of the next character `x`, and `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `x` will be the next character in the string `i`.
- `sum_value_digits` will be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus the integer value of the current `x`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `values[i]` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `sum_value_digits` will be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus the integer value of the current `x`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not known yet, we represent it symbolically.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers; `sum_value_digits` is the sum of `int(x)` plus the integer value of the next character `x`, and `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x` where `x` is the next character in the string `i`.**
