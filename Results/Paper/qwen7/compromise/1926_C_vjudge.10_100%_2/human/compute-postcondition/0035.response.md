Output State: The final state of `values[i]` will be the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `inf` (200001). For each integer `i` from 1 to 200001, `values[i]` will store the sum of `values[i-1]` and the sum of the digits of `i`. 

In simpler terms, `values[i]` will contain the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 up to the number `i`. This means that `values[1]` will be the sum of the digits of 1, `values[2]` will be the sum of the digits of 1 plus the sum of the digits of 2, and so on, until `values[200001]` which will be the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200001.
