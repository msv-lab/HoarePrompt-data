Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers.
- `sum_value_digits` holds the same sum of these integer values.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, inf):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs infinitely starting from `i = 1`.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- There are no other variables or conditions mentioned in the loop head that would affect the loop's continuation.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since the loop continues infinitely and the only variable involved in the loop head is `i`, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.
- The state of `sum_value_digits` does not change within the loop head since it is not referenced there.

### New State:
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `sum_value_digits` remains unchanged.

### Final Answer:
State: **`values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers, and `sum_value_digits` holds the same sum of these integer values, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
