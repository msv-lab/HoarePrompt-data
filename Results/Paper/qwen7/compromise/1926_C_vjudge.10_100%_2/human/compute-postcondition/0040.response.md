Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `t` and the loop counter `_`. However, since the loop counter `_` is typically just used as a placeholder and does not affect the loop condition, we focus on `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `t` is at least 200001.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be at least 200001.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be at least 200001. Since the value of `t` is not modified within the loop body (as indicated by the comment `# the loop body is omit`), `t` remains unchanged from its value at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be at least 200001, `value` is an input integer**
