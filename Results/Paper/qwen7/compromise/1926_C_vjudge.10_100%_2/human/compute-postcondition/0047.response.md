Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a test case where `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5. The function does not return any value directly but seems to handle or process these integers based on their ranges.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over multiple test cases, validating `t` and `n` against the specified ranges, but since the output is not explicitly defined beyond the constraints, the primary functionality described is the validation and processing of these integers within the given ranges.
