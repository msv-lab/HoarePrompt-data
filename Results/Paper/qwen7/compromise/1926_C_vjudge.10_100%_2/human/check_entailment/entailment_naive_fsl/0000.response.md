Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program precomputes the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and stores them in an array `values`. However, this approach is inefficient and unnecessary for solving the problem as described.

The program should directly compute the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to \(n\) without precomputing and storing all intermediate results. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            sum_value_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
            total_sum += sum_value_digits
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

This corrected version iterates through each number from 1 to \(n\), calculates the sum of its digits, and accumulates this sum to get the final result. This approach ensures that the program works correctly for any \(n\) within the specified range and adheres to the problem description.
