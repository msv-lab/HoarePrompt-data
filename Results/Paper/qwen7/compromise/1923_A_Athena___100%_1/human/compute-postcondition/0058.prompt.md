Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `res` is 0, `i` is 2.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty because it keeps removing elements from the front until no more zeros are at the beginning or there are no elements left. The variable `res` remains 0 as the loop does not modify it. The variable `i` remains 2 as it is not changed within the loop. The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` does not contain a 0, `res` is 0, `i` is 2
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` does not contain a `0` and its last element is removed, `res` is `0`, `i` is `2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` must be greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is not empty and its last element is removed, `res` is 0, `i` is 2


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
