Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is non-empty and `a[-1]` is no longer 0, `res` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given the initial conditions, `a[-1]` must be 0, but after executing `a.pop()`, `a[-1]` is no longer 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
