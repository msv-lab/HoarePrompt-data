The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 40` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 2n`. It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`. It then calls the `make_array` function to fill `arr` with the value `1` and `cliquess` with the value `ceil(n / k)`. Finally, it prints the contents of `arr`, the calculated number of cliques, and the contents of `cliquess`.
