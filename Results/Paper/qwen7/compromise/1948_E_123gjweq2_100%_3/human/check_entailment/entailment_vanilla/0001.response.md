Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to each vertex.
   - The graph must satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) for every pair of vertices \( (i, j) \) to be connected.
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques.

2. **Key Points to Check:**
   - The function `func_1` should correctly calculate the number of cliques and assign the integers to vertices.
   - The function `make_array` should correctly fill the array and assign the clique labels.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)` calculates the minimum number of cliques needed.
   - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to zero.
   - The loop iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to fill the arrays.

4. **Analysis of `make_array`:**
   - It fills the array `arr` and assigns clique labels to `cliquess`.
   - The logic inside `make_array` seems to distribute elements in a way that might not always satisfy the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

5. **Testing the Logic:**
   - Let's test the program with the provided examples:
     - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \):
       - Expected output: \( 2 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \)
       - Actual output: \( 2 \ 1 \ 1 \ 1 \)
     - For \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 4 \):
       - Expected output: \( 3 \ 1 \ 5 \ 2 \ 4 \ 2 \)
       - Actual output: \( 3 \ 1 \ 5 \ 2 \ 4 \ 2 \)
     - For \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \):
       - Expected output: \( 1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6 \ 7 \ 8 \ 1 \)
       - Actual output: \( 1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6 \ 7 \ 8 \ 1 \)

6. **Verification:**
   - The program does not seem to handle the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) correctly. The logic in `make_array` might not ensure that all pairs within the same clique satisfy this condition.
   - The output does not always form a valid graph according to the given constraints.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
