Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to assign values to vertices and determine the number of cliques and their partition.
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` using the `ceil` function from the `math` module.
   - It initializes two arrays: `arr` to store the assigned values and `cliquess` to store the clique assignments.
   - The main logic is in the loop where it calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` array and `cliquess` array.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the given `left`, `right`, and `clique`.
   - It calculates the middle point (`mid`) and the non-middle part (`not_mid`) of the range `[left, right]`.
   - It assigns values to the `arr` array such that the first half of the range gets smaller elements and the second half gets larger elements.
   - It assigns the same `clique` value to all elements in the specified range.

### Checking the Logic

1. **Assigning Values**:
   - The `make_array` function ensures that the values are assigned in a way that satisfies the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - For example, if `k = 3` and `n = 2`, the assignment `2 1` will ensure that the condition is met because \( |1 - 2| + |1 - 2| = 2 \le 3 \).

2. **Clique Assignment**:
   - The `cliquess` array is correctly filled to ensure that vertices within the same range belong to the same clique.
   - This ensures that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` and `k` are small, ensuring that the conditions are met.
   - For example, when `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the output `2 1` is correct.

### Testing the Program

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program seems to correctly assign values to vertices and partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
