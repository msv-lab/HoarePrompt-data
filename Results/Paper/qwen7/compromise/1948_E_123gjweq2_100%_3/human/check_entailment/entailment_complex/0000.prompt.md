Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Functions:
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 40, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n, and the function `make_array` is defined elsewhere to fill the array `arr` with values based on the given parameters.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cliques` is equal to ceil(`n` / `k`), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 40, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n, `arr` is a list of length `n` where each element is set to `cliquess[i]` which is `cliques`, and `cliquess` is a list of `n` ones.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = cliques - 1`. For each iteration, it calls the function `make_array` with parameters `i * k`, `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)`, and `i + 1`. This function presumably modifies the `arr` and `cliquess` lists. Since the details of `make_array` are not provided, we can infer that it sets each element in `arr` to `cliques` and each element in `cliquess` to `i + 1`. However, based on the given information, it seems more likely that each element in `cliquess` is set to `cliques`, making all elements in `cliquess` equal to `cliques`. Each element in `arr` is set to `cliques`, making `arr` a list of `n` zeros transformed into a list of `n` ones.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 ... 1 (n times)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: ceil(n / k)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 ... 1 (n times)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 40` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 2n`. It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`. It then calls the `make_array` function to fill `arr` with the value `1` and `cliquess` with the value `ceil(n / k)`. Finally, it prints the contents of `arr`, the calculated number of cliques, and the contents of `cliquess`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that left < right and both are within the range [0, n-1]. clique is an integer representing the clique identifier.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is an integer such that `left` < `right` and both are within the range [0, n-1], `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr` is modified such that for each `i` in the range `[0, mid)`, `arr[left + mid - i - 1]` is set to `small_element + i` and `cliquess[left + i]` is set to `clique`.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is an integer such that `left` < `right` and both are within the range [0, n-1], `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr` is modified such that for each `i` in the range `[0, not_mid)`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i` and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It modifies an array `arr` and another array `cliquess` based on these parameters. Specifically, it sets elements in `arr` to values between `small_element` and `big_element` in a specific pattern determined by `mid` and `not_mid`. Additionally, it assigns the value of `clique` to corresponding indices in `cliquess`. After the function executes, the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are updated according to the described pattern.
