Postcondition: `cur` is 0, `T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is an empty dictionary, and the current value of `num` is greater than or equal to `cur + 1`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
