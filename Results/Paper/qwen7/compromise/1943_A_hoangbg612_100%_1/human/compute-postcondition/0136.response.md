Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, `cur` is equal to `num`, and M[cur] is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to `M[cur]`. The initial conditions for `N`, `cur`, and the condition related to `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, `N` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, `cur` is still equal to `num`, and `M[cur]` is now 1.
