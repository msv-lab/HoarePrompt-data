Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, `cur` is the original value of `cur` plus 1, `num` is an integer greater than the current element `cur` in the list `N` by more than 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Since `cur` was originally greater than the current element in the list `N` by more than 1, after incrementing `cur`, it remains true that `num` is an integer greater than the new value of `cur` by more than 1. The list `N` and the variable `num` remain unchanged.
