Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `cur` will be the highest value present in the list `N`, and `M[cur]` will be the count of how many times `cur` appears in `N`. All other values in `M` will be zero or represent counts of numbers less than `cur` in `N`. The list `N` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `T` is decreased by the total number of iterations the loop executed.**

This means that after the loop completes, `cur` will hold the largest number from the list `N`, and `M` will contain the frequency of each unique number in `N`, with `M[cur]` holding the highest frequency. All other entries in `M` will either be zero (if no corresponding number was found in `N`) or will represent the count of numbers less than `cur` in `N`. The variable `T` will be reduced by the number of times the loop iterated through `N`.
