Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All elements in the list `N` have been processed, `cur` is the current value of the last unique number encountered plus 1 or -1 if no such number exists, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, and `M` is a dictionary where keys are the unique numbers from `N` (or -1) that are greater than `cur` and their values are 1, and for all other keys in `M`, the values are the counts of occurrences of those numbers in `N`. The list `cnt` is now empty.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is one of the keys in the dictionary `M`; if `M[k]` equals 1, then `cnt` is a list containing the element `k`. If `M[k]` is not 1, then `cnt` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is the next key in the dictionary `M`, `M` is the same dictionary. If `M[k]` equals 1, then `k` is appended to the list `cnt`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is the next key in the dictionary `M`; if `M[k]` equals 1, then `cnt` is a list containing the value of `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
