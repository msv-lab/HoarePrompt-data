Postcondition: `cur` is -1, `T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, and `M` is a dictionary. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M[cur]` is set to 1 and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `M[-1]` is 1, and `cur` remains -1.
