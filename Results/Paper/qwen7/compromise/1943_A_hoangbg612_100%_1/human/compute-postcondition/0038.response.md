Output State: **`cur` is an integer; `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `S` is an input integer; `N` is a list with at least two fewer elements; `M` is a dictionary; `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
