Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `cnt` is a list, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `N`. The variables `T`, `cnt`, and `S` remain unchanged from their initial states.
