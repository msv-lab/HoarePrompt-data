Output State: **`N` is not empty, `cur` is `num`, and `M[cur]` remains 1.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to the variable `cur`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `N` is still not empty, `cur` is now equal to `num`, and `M[cur]` remains 1.
