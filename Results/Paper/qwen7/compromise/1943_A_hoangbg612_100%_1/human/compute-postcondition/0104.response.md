Output State: **`cur` is the last element in `N` plus 1, and `M[cur]` is 1 if `cur` was not previously in `M`, or it is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `cur` in `N`. The sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`; `cnt` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = []` initializes an empty list named `cnt`. This does not affect the values of `cur`, `M`, or `S`. Therefore, the previous conditions and values remain unchanged, and a new empty list `cnt` is created.
