Output State: **`cur` is the current value being tracked; M[cur] is the count of how many times `cur` has been encountered plus one; `num` is the next element in the list `N`.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. Therefore, `M[cur]` is updated to its current value plus one. The values of `cur` and `num` remain unchanged.
