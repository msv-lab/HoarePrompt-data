Postcondition: **After the loop executes all iterations, `cur` will be the highest value present in the list `N`, and `M[cur]` will be the count of how many times `cur` appears in `N`. All other values in `M` will be zero or represent counts of numbers less than `cur` in `N`. The list `N` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `T` is decreased by the total number of iterations the loop executed. The sum of all values in `M` is equal to `S`.**
