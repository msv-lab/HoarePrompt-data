Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, `num` is the next element in the list `N`, `cur` is the value of `cur` incremented by 1, and `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` has been encountered, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `N`, `num`, `cur`, and `M[cur]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
