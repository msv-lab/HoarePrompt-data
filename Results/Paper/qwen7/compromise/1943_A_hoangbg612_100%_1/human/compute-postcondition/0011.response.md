Output State: **`cur` is 0, `T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least one element, `M` is an empty dictionary, and the current value of `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is incremented by 1, changing its value from -1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
