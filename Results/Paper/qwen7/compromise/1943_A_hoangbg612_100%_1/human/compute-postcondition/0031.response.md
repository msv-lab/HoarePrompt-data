Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `N`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **`num`**: This variable takes the value of the current element from the list `N` during each iteration.
   - **`N`**: The list `N` loses one element with each iteration because it is modified within the loop (specifically, `N.pop(0)` is called).

4. **Initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is an integer.
   - `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\).
   - `S` is an input integer.
   - `N` is a list with at least one fewer element.
   - `M` is a dictionary.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the current element being processed, it remains unchanged for the next iteration.
   - `N` must lose one more element, meaning it now has at least two fewer elements compared to the previous state.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `cur` remains the same.
- `T` remains the same.
- `S` remains the same.
- `N` must now have at least two fewer elements.
- `M` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`cur` is an integer, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least two fewer elements, and `M` is a dictionary.**
