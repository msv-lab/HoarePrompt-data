Output State: **`ans` is the string where the last character is now `chr(s[j] + 97)`, `j` is the next element in `array`, and `s[j]` is the value of `s[j]` after being increased by 1**.

This means that the string `ans` has been updated by appending a new character to its end, which is derived from the character corresponding to the new value of `s[j]` (after incrementing by 1). The variable `j` remains pointing to the next element in the array, and `s[j]` has been incremented by 1.
