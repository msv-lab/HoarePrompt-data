Output State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 's', the character at index `j-2` in `ans` is 'b', and `j` is increased by 1; the character at index `j-1` in `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the character at index `j` in the string `ans` by 1. Since the character at index `j-2` in `ans` was originally 'b', after incrementing, it becomes 'c'. The character at index `j` (which was the last character before the increment) is now incremented by 1. The last character of `ans` remains 's', and `j` is increased by 1.
