Output State: **`ans` is a string composed of characters `chr(s[j] + 97)` for each `j` in `array`, with `s[j]` incremented by 1 for each iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, and `l` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The initial values of `ans`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans` remains a string composed of characters `chr(s[j] + 97)` for each `j` in `array`, with `s[j]` incremented by 1 for each iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` retains its previous input value.
