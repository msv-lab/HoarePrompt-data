Output State: **`l` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**

Explanation: The code `l = int(input())` takes an input from the user, which is guaranteed to be a value between 1 and \(10^4\), and converts it to an integer. This integer is then assigned to the variable `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, meaning no other variables are affected by this operation.
