Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the iterable `array`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `l` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `s` is a list of `l` elements, each element being 0.
   - `array` is a list of integers created from input split and mapped to integers.
   - `ans` is an empty string.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `array`.
   - For the loop to execute, `array` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `array` is the only object in the loop head that directly affects the loop's execution, we need to ensure that `array` has at least one element.
   - The other variables (`l`, `s`, and `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `array` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`array` must have at least one element**
