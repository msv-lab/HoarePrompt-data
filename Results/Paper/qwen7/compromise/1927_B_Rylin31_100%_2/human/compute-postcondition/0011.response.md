Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `array`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `array` and `j` is within the bounds of `array`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is a string where the last character is `chr(s[j] + 98)`.
   - `j` is the next element in `array`.
   - `s[j]` is the value of `s[j]` after being increased by 1.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the next element in `array` and `array` must still contain elements.
   - After the loop executes, `j` will be incremented, and `s[j]` will be increased by 1 again.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - `s[j]` will be increased by 1 again.
   - The loop will check if `j` is still within the bounds of `array`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ans` remains the same because it is updated inside the loop body.
- `j` is incremented by 1.
- `s[j]` is increased by 1.
- `array` must still contain elements for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` is the string where the last character is `chr(s[j] + 98)`, `j` is incremented by 1, `s[j]` is increased by 1, and `array` must still contain elements**.
