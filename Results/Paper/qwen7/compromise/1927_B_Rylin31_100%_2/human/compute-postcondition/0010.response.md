Output State: **`ans` is the string where the last character is now `chr(s[j] + 98)`, `j` is the next element in `array`, and `s[j]` is the value of `s[j]` after being increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. Since the last character of `ans` was previously `chr(s[j] + 97)`, after incrementing `s[j]` by 1, the new character will be `chr(s[j] + 98)`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
