Output State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 's', `j` is increased by 1 from its previous value, and the character at index `j-2` in `ans` is 'b'.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `ans` ends with 'a', and the character at index `j-2` is incremented by 1.
- The code appends a character to `ans` using `chr(s[j] + 97)`. Since `s[j]` is the character at index `j` in `s`, and assuming `s[j]` is 'a' (as it's incremented from 'a-1'), `chr('a' + 97)` results in 's'.
- After appending 's' to `ans`, `ans` now ends with 's'.
- `j` is increased by 1 from its previous value.
- The character at index `j-2` in `ans` was originally 'b' (since it was incremented from 'a-1'), and it remains 'b' after the append operation.
