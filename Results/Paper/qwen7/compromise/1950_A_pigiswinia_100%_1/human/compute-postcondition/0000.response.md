Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and `t` is the integer input by the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, the new value of `t` will still satisfy this condition, but now it is specifically the integer input by the user. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they were not involved in the given code snippet.
