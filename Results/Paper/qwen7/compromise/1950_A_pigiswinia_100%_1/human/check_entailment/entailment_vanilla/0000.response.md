### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is met.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is met.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases where the conditions do not match. For example, if `a >= b` or `b <= c` for a stair condition, or if `a >= b` or `b <= c` for a peak condition, it correctly identifies these as "NONE".

Given that the program follows the logic correctly and handles all possible test cases as described in the problem statement, there are no errors in the provided code.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness: **True**
