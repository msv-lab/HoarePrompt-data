Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the first element in `ans`, and `temp` contains an element which is `(q - r) % n`, if `c` is either '0' or '?'.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `q` is the first element in `ans` and `temp` originally contained the value `(q + r) % n`, now `temp` also contains the value `(q - r) % n`. The precondition that `ans` must contain at least one element and `q` is the first element in `ans` remains unchanged. The value of `c` being either '0' or '?' does not affect the output state of the variables.
