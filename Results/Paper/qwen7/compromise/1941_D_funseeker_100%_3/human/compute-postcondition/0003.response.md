Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is a string, `c` is a string, and they are assigned the values returned by `func_1().split()`**

Explanation: The code `r, c = func_1().split()` splits the string returned by `func_1()` into two parts and assigns them to `r` and `c` respectively. Since the exact values returned by `func_1()` are not specified, we can only say that `r` and `c` are strings resulting from the split operation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
