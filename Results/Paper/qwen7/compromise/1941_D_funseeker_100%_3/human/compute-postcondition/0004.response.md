Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is an integer converted from the string `r`, `c` is a string, and they are assigned the values returned by `func_1().split()`**.

In this case, the code `r = int(r)` converts the string `r` into an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state includes the updated type of `r` as an integer.
