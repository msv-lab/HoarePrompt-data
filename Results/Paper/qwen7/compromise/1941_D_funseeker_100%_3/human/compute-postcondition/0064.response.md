Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for q in ans:`. The objects involved here are `q` and `ans`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `ans` contains all the elements from `temp`.
   - `temp` is an empty set.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer.
   - `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop `for q in ans:` to execute, `ans` must not be an empty set. Since `ans` contains all the elements from `temp` and `temp` is an empty set, `ans` is also an empty set initially. Therefore, the loop cannot execute as `ans` is empty.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. This means we need to add at least one element to `ans`.

Given the above analysis, the state needs to be adjusted such that `ans` contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` is an empty set, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer, and `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`**.
