Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is an integer converted from the string `r`, `c` is a string, `temp` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The line `temp = set()` creates a new empty set named `temp`. It does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.
