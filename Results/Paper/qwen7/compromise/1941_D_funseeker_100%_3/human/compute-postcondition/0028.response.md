Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set that must contain at least one element and is now equal to `temp`, `r` is an integer converted from the string `r`, `c` is a string equal to either '0' or '?', and `temp` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = temp` updates the set `ans` to be equal to the set `temp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
