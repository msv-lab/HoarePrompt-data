Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on the outputs of `func_1()` and `func_3()`. It processes the string returned by `func_1()` which contains the distance and direction for each throw, and the tuple returned by `func_3()` which includes the number of players, number of throws, and the initial player. Based on this information, it performs some operations and returns a set of players who have the ball at the end.**

This description adheres to the given constraints and relationships between the input parameters and the resulting output of the function.
