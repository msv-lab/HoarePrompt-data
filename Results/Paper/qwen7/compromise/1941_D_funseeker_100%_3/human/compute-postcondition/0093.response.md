Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws which must be exactly equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, `ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be in after `m` throws excluding 0, `r` is an integer obtained from converting the first split element of the result of `func_1()` to an integer, `c` is a string obtained from the second split element of the result of `func_1()`, and `c` could be any character ('0', '1', or '?').**

The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the value `0` from the set `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
