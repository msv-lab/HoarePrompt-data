Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `ii`, which ranges from `0` to `tt-1`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `ans` is the sum of all elements in `tmp` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1` plus `y`, otherwise `ans` remains the same as its value after the last iteration where `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1`.

3. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `ii < tt`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop variable `ii` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `ii` will be `ii + 1`.
   - The value of `tt` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `ans` will depend on the condition `y >= i - 1` and the current value of `ii`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ii` will be `ii + 1`.
   - `tt` remains the same.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the condition `y >= (ii - 1) + 1 - 1 = ii`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is the sum of all elements in `tmp` if `y` is greater than or equal to `ii` plus `y`, otherwise `ans` remains the same as its value after the last iteration where `y` was greater than or equal to `ii`.**
