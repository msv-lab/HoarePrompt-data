Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in tmp`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The variables involved are `i` and `tmp`.

3. **Understand the postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the first element of `tmp`.
   - `tmp` is a sorted list with at least one element.
   - `ans` is increased by `i - 1` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the first element of `tmp` at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be the second element of `tmp`.
   - `tmp` must still be a sorted list with at least one element (it will now have at least two elements).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be the second element of `tmp`.
   - `tmp` must be a sorted list with at least two elements.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is the second element of `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list with at least two elements**.
