Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, `tmp` is a sorted list containing elements that satisfy the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` when `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, and `ans` will be the count of consecutive elements with a difference of 2 plus the count of pairs of elements with an even difference that is not 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` contains one element which is `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least one element, and `ans` is updated as follows: if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is incremented by `i` and `y` is decremented by `i - 1`; otherwise, `y` is less than `i - 1` and `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the first element of `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list with at least one element, and `ans` is increased by `i - 1` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the second element of `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list with at least two elements, and `ans` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus the second element of `tmp` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
