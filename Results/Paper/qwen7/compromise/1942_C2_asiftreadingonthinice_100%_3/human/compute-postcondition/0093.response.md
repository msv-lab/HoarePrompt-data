Postcondition: `i` is either 2 or 3, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `tmp` is a list depending on the condition `a[2] - a[1]`, and `ans` is updated based on the following rules: if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2` (where `i` is 2), then `ans` is 1; otherwise, if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`, `ans` is updated accordingly, otherwise `ans` retains its original value based on the condition `a[2] - a[1]`.
