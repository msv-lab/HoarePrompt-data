Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is either `x + y` or `x + y - 1`, `tmp` is a list of sorted values of the form `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` where `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0`, and `i` is equal to `len(a)`
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `tmp` must contain at least one element. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is the original value of `y` minus `(i - 1)`, and `ans` is incremented by `i`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, then `y` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tmp` must contain at least one element, `i` is either the first element of `tmp` or no longer the first element of `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the first element of `tmp` plus whatever was previously in `ans`, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, `i` remains the first element of `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `tmp` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `tmp`, and `ans` is increased by the value of `i`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, then the loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
