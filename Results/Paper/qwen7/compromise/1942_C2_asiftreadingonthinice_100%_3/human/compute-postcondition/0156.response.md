Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing 1 and the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the expression evaluates to `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. This value is then appended to `tmp`. Since `i` was 3, after executing the line `i` is incremented by 1, making it 4. All other variables retain their original values.
