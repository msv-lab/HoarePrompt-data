Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, `tmp` is a sorted list containing elements that satisfy the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` when `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, and `ans` will be the count of consecutive elements with a difference of 2 plus the count of pairs of elements with an even difference that is not 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` contains one element which is `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code `tmp.sort()` sorts the list `tmp`. Sorting does not change the content of `tmp`, it only changes the order of its elements. All other variables (`i`, `ans`, `a`, `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state retains the same conditions and values as the initial state, except that `tmp` is now sorted.
