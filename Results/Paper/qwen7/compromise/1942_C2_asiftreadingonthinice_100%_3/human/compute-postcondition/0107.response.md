Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `tmp` is a list containing one element which is ((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2), `ans` will be the count of consecutive elements with a difference of 2 plus the count of pairs of elements with an even difference that is not 2, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)` to the list `tmp`. Since `tmp` was previously defined to contain elements that satisfy the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` when `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2, the new element added to `tmp` does not change its definition. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
