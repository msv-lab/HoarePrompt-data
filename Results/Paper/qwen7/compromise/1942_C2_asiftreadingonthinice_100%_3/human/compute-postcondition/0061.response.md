Output State: **`i` is the next element in `tmp` after `i_end`, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not alter the values of `i` or `tmp`. It simply indicates that the execution would exit the current loop or conditional structure. Therefore, the values of `i` and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial state.
