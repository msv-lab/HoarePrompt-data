State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list, `i` is 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop starts with `i` in the range `1` to `len(a)`.
2. For the loop to execute, `i` must be at least `1`.
3. The initial value of `i` should be set to `1` to ensure the loop starts.
4. Other variables (`a`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `ans`, `tmp`) do not affect the loop's execution condition directly, so they retain their original values.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `i` to be `1`.
