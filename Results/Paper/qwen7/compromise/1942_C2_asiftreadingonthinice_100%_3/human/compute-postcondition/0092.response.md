Postcondition: `i` is either 2 or 3, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` or `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` depending on the condition, and `ans` is 1 if `a[2] - a[1] == 2`, otherwise it retains its original value based on the condition `a[2] - a[1]` and updates to the appropriate value if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`.
