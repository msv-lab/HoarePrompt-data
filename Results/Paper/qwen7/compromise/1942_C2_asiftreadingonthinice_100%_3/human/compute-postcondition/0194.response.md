Output State: **`tmp` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `tmp`, `y` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, and `ans` is increased by the value of `i`.**

In this step, the value of `ans` is updated by adding the value of `i` (which is the second element of `tmp`) to `ans`. The other variables (`tmp`, `i`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
