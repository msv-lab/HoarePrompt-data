Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a value based on the given constraints and input data for each test case.**

For each test case, the function checks the validity of the input values according to the specified constraints and processes the x distinct integers provided. However, since the function signature does not include any parameters, the functionality described focuses on the input structure and expected output without detailing the internal processing steps.
