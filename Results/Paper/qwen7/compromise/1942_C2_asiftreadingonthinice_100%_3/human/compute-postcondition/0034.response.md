Output State: **`ans` is incremented by 1, `tmp` contains the half of the difference between consecutive elements in `a` whenever this difference is even but not 2, the sum of the first element `a[0]` and the value of `n` is 2 more than the last element `a[len(a) - 1]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other conditions and values of `tmp` and the relationship between `a[0]`, `n`, and `a[len(a) - 1]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
