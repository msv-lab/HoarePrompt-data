Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, `tmp` is a list containing either elements that satisfy the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` when `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and not equal to 2 (if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not 2), or a single element which is `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)` (if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2), `ans` is the count of consecutive elements with a difference of 2 plus the count of pairs of elements with an even difference that is not 2, and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2 if the if part is executed, otherwise it is even and not equal to 2.
