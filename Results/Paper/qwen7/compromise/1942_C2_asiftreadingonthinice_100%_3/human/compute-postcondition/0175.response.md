Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is `x + y - 1`, `tmp` is a list containing one or more values of the form `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` where `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0`, and now includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)` if the condition `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0)` is true, and `i` is equal to `len(a)`. The sum of the first element of `a` and `n` is not equal to the second element of `a` plus 2.**
