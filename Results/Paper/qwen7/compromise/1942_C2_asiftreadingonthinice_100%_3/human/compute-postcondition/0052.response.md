Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `tmp`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `tmp`. Therefore, the value of `i` will be set to each element in `tmp` in sequence.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to some value from the list `tmp`.
   - **List `tmp`**: The list `tmp` remains unchanged as the loop simply iterates over its elements.

Given the postconditions and the loop structure, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration. Since `i` is set to each element in `tmp` in sequence, the next value of `i` will be the next element in `tmp`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not specified, we can denote it as `i_end`. The next value of `i` will be the next element in the list `tmp`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be the next element in `tmp` after `i_end`.
- `tmp` remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is the next element in `tmp` after `i_end`, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list**
