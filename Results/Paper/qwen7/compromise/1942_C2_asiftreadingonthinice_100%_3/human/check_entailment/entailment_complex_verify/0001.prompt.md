You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates a value `ans` based on these inputs and certain conditions. Specifically, `ans` is initialized to `x + y - 2` and then adjusted based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list of integers and the difference between the first and last elements. Finally, `ans` is incremented by values from a sorted list `tmp` up to the point where `y` becomes zero. The function returns the minimum value between `n - 2` and the computed `ans`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given solution step by step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input and Sorting**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of `x` chosen vertices `a`.
   - It sorts the list of chosen vertices `a`.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The initial number of triangles is calculated as `x + y - 2`. This is because initially, we can form `x - 2` triangles using the `x` chosen vertices (since a triangle requires 3 vertices, and we start with `x` vertices).
   - We also check for consecutive pairs of chosen vertices with a gap of 2 (indicating a potential triangle). If found, we add 1 to the count.
   - Similarly, we check the gap between the first and last chosen vertices and add 1 if the gap is 2.

3. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices**:
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and stores them in `tmp`.
   - It then sorts `tmp` to handle the gaps efficiently.
   - For each gap in `tmp`, if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, it adds `i` to the answer and reduces `y` by `i - 1`. Otherwise, it breaks the loop.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - Finally, it adds any remaining `y` to the answer and ensures the final answer does not exceed `n - 2` (since the whole cake cannot be divided into more than `n - 2` triangles).

### Analysis:

- The logic for calculating the initial number of triangles and handling consecutive gaps seems correct.
- The sorting and greedy approach to maximize the number of triangles using the available `y` vertices appears sound.
- The final adjustment to ensure the answer does not exceed `n - 2` is necessary and correct.

Given the problem constraints and the logical steps in the code, the provided solution should correctly compute the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
