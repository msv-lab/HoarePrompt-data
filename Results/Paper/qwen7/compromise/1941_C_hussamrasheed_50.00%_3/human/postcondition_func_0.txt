The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' in `s`, removes all instances of 'map' from `s`, counts the occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the modified `s`, and prints the sum of these two counts for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs `t` integers, each representing the sum of counts of 'map' and 'pie' for the corresponding input string `s`.
