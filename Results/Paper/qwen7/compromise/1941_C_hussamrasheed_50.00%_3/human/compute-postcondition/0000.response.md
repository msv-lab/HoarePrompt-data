Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. The other conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state (such as `n` and the string `s`) are not affected by this code snippet.
