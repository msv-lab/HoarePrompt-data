#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, each string containing M characters describing a row of the field. The list has N rows. The field contains goals for the two teams (RG and BG), players (R0, ..., R9, B0, ..., B9), the Quaffle (.Q), and optionally one Bludger (.B). The number of players and goals for each team is between 1 and 5. The value of T, the number of steps in the game, is between 0 and 10000, inclusive.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple containing the sum of the first elements of lists `a` and `b` as the first element, and the sum of the second elements of lists `a` and `b` as the second element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are both lists containing exactly two integers. It returns a tuple where the first element is the sum of the first integers from `a` and `b`, and the second element is the sum of the second integers from `a` and `b`.
