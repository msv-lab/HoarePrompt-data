Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) match the described settling pattern.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must fit into one of the repeating patterns.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find all divisors of \( q \) (where \( q = n + x - 2 \)) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - These divisors represent potential values of \( k \) because they indicate positions where the number \( x \) could appear in the settling pattern.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - It checks if \( y \) is even. If not, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - Depending on the position \( n \), it may add more potential \( k \) values from another calculation.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique \( k \) values returned by `func_1`.

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies potential \( k \) values by finding divisors of \( q \) that meet the criteria.
   - The main program correctly handles the input and output as specified.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
