Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is a string, `c` is a string, and they are the result of splitting the output of `func_1()`**.

Explanation: The code splits the output of `func_1()` into two parts, assigning them to `r` and `c`. Since the exact values of `r` and `c` depend on the output of `func_1()`, which is not specified, we only know that they are strings resulting from the split operation. All other variables remain in their initial states.
