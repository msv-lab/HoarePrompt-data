Output State: **`q` is `x`, the value of `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` contains an element `(x + r) % n`**

Explanation: The code adds an element to the `temp` set, which is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. Since `q` is equal to `x`, the expression becomes `(x + r) % n`. The values of `c` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
