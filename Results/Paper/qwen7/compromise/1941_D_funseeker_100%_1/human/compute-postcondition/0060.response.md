Output State: **All players have the ball at least once; `m` is `m - 1`; `r` is the first split element from the result of `func_1()`.split(), `c` is the second split element from the result of `func_1()`.split().**

Explanation: The code `r, c = func_1().split()` splits the string returned by `func_1()` into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter and assigns the first part to `r` and the second part to `c`. The initial state that all players have the ball at least once and `m` is `m - 1` remains unchanged.
