Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    r, c = func_1().split()
    r = int(r)
    temp = set()
    for q in ans:
        if c == '0' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q + r) % n)
        if c == '1' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q - r) % n)
    ans = temp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is converted to an integer from the string `r`, `c` is a string, `temp` is a set containing all unique values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`, `ans` is now equal to `temp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All players have the ball at least once; ans is equal to temp.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, `temp` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and `c` remains either '0' or '?'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
