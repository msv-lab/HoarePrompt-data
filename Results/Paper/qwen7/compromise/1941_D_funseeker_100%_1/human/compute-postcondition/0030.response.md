Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is a string obtained from the first part of the split function applied to the output of `func_1()`, `c` is a string obtained from the second part of the split function applied to the output of `func_1()`, `temp` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code `r, c = func_1().split()` splits the output of `func_1()` into two parts and assigns them to `r` and `c` respectively. Since the exact output of `func_1()` is not specified, we assume it returns a single string which is then split into two parts. The set `ans` remains unchanged, and `temp` is initialized as an empty set.
