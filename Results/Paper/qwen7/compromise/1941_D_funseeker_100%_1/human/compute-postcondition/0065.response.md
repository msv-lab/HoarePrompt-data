Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, `temp` contains (q + r) % n, `c` is either '0' or '?'**

Explanation: The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. The initial state of `ans` being a list with at least one element and `c` being either '0' or '?' remains unchanged. The new value added to `temp` is the result of `(q + r) % n`.
