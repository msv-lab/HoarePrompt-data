Output State: **`ans` contains all possible players who could have the ball except 0, and now includes `n`; `temp` holds the same set of values as the updated `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.add(n)` adds the value of `n` to the set `ans`. Since `temp` holds the same set of values as `ans`, `temp` also includes the value of `n` after this operation.
