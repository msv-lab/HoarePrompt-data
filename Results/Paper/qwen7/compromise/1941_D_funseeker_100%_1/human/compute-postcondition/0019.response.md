Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `r` is converted to an integer from the string `r`, `c` is a string, `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, and if `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Initially, `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`. After executing the line `temp.add((q - r) % n)`, `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
