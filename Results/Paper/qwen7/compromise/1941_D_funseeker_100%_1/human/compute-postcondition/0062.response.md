Output State: **`m` is `m - 1`, `r` is the integer value of the first split element from the result of `func_1()`.split(), `c` is the second split element from the result of `func_1()`.split(), `temp` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty set named `temp`. This does not affect the values of `m`, `r`, or `c`. Therefore, the values of `m` and `r` remain as they were initially, and `c` also remains unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `temp`, which is now an empty set.
