Output State: **`q` is `x`, the value of `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` contains elements `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, and `(q - r) % n`, and if `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` also contains `(q + r) % n`. `ans` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation: The code adds `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Initially, `temp` contained `(x + r) % n` and `(x - r) % n`. If `c` was '0' or '?', `temp` also contained `(q + r) % n`. After adding `(q - r) % n`, these conditions still hold true. Therefore, `temp` now includes `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, and `(q - r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
