Postcondition: **`ans` contains all possible players who could have the ball, and `temp` holds the same set of values as `ans`. The variable `r` is an integer derived from the string `r` during each iteration, and `c` is either '0', '1', or '?' determining which operation is performed. After all iterations, every player will have had the ball at least once. The current value of `0` is present in `ans`.**
