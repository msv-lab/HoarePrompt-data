The only object in the loop head is the variable `m`, which controls the number of iterations of the loop. Since the loop is controlled by `m`, and no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, we need to consider how `m` changes with each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, all players have the ball at least once, and `ans` is equal to `temp`.

Let's break it down:

1. The loop runs `m` times.
2. After each iteration, `m` is decremented by 1 because the loop runs from `range(m)`.
3. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 0.

Given that the loop has just completed an iteration, `m` must have been decremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `m` should be `m - 1`.

Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, we don't need to adjust the states of `ans` or `temp`.

State: **All players have the ball at least once; `m` is `m - 1`**
