Output State: **The program returns the subarray from `segments_variants` with the highest starting index. If `len(total_max_segment) == 1`, then `total_max_segment` is set to `[-1]`**.

This means that the program will return the subarray that has the highest starting index among the subarrays in `segments_variants`. If the `total_max_segment` itself is a single element (i.e., its length is 1), then it will be replaced with `[-1]` before returning.
