Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(arr)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not initialized yet, but it will start from 0 in the first iteration.
   - `len(arr)` is the length of the list `arr`, which is a known value but not specified in the given state.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(arr)`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be able to iterate through all elements of `arr`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `len(arr) - 1` for the loop to execute properly.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `max_sum` is -1, which is irrelevant to the loop starting condition.
   - `arr` is a list of integers, and its length (`len(arr)`) is a fixed value but not specified in the state.
   - `new_segment` is an empty list, which is irrelevant to the loop starting condition.
   - `max_segment` is [0, 0], which is irrelevant to the loop starting condition.
   - `segments_variants` is an empty list, which is irrelevant to the loop starting condition.

The only relevant state to adjust is `i` starting from 0, and `len(arr)` being a positive integer (since the loop should execute at least once).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `len(arr)` must be greater than 0**
