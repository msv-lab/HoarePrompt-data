Output State: **`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers where each element is within the range [-10^9, 10^9]; `new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is [0, 0]; `segments_variants` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `max_sum` to -1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `max_sum` is set to -1, while the other variables retain their original values.
