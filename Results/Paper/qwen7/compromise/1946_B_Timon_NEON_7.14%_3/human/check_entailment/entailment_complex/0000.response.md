Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The key insight is that the maximum sum can be achieved by repeatedly adding the sum of the entire array.
   - The function `func_2` aims to find the subarray with the maximum sum, which is used to calculate the initial sum before applying the operations.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Analysis of Functions**:
   - **func_2**: This function correctly identifies the subarray with the maximum sum. It iterates through the array and keeps track of the current segment sum. When encountering a negative number, it checks if the current segment sum is greater than the maximum segment sum found so far. If so, it updates the maximum segment sum and resets the current segment sum.
   - **func_1**: This function correctly computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Given the input `number`, it returns `number % 1000000007`.
   - **func_3**: This function is not used in the provided code. The code directly uses the logic from `func_2` and `func_1` without calling `func_3`.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The main logic in the code is correct. It calculates the initial maximum segment sum using `func_2`, then applies the formula to get the final answer using `func_1`.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
