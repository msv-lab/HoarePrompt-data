Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly captures the logic of the problem. It iterates through different multiples of odd numbers, keeping track of how many cards have been laid down (`s`) and the current multiple (`m`).
2. The loop terminates when the cumulative count of cards laid down (`s`) plus the current batch of cards (`x`) is greater than or equal to `k`.
3. The formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` correctly calculates the `k-th` card based on the current multiple (`m`) and the offset within the current batch (`k - s`).

Given the annotations and the logic, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
