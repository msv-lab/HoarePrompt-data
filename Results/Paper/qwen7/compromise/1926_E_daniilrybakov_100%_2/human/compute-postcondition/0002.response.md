Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5 â‹… 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5 â‹… 10^4 remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are set to the integers input by the user.
