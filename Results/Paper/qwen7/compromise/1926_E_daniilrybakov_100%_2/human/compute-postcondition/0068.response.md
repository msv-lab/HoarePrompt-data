Output State: **`s` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is \(2^{i+1}\), `x` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `s` is incremented by 1, and its new value is not specified in the input, so it remains as "incremented by 1". The value of `m` remains unchanged as \(2^{i+1}\). The value of `x` remains 1.
