Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
