Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is now `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. All the initial conditions and variable states remain the same after executing the `break` statement.
