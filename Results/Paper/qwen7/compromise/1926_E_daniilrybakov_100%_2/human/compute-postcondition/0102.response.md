Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of integers t, n, and k. It calculates and prints a result based on the given conditions. Specifically, for each test case, it computes a value derived from n, k, and t, ensuring that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated result for each case.**
