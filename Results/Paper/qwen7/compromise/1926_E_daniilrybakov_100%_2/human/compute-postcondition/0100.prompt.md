Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and `t` is now the integer input value.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    m = 1
    while n:
        x = (n + 1) // 2
        n //= 2
        if s < k and k <= s + x:
            break
        s += x
        m *= 2
    print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` will eventually become 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration until `n` becomes 0, `m` will be \(2^{\text{number of iterations}}\), and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` at the last iteration. If `s < k` and `k <= s + x` at any point, the loop breaks early.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `s` is the sum of \((n + 1) // 2\) for each iteration until the condition `s >= k` or `k > s + x` is met, `n` is 0 (since it keeps halving and will eventually reach 0), `k` is an input integer, `m` is \(2^i\) where \(i\) is the number of iterations, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\) which becomes 1 when `n` is 0, and the loop breaks if `s >= k`.

In simpler terms, `s` accumulates the value of \((n + 1) // 2\) for each iteration until the condition `s >= k` or `k > s + x` is satisfied, `n` becomes 0 after multiple halvings, `m` doubles with each iteration, and `x` becomes 1 when `n` reaches 0. The loop exits if `s` becomes greater than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `s` is the sum of `x` for each iteration, `n` is reduced to `n // 2**3`, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 8 (since it doubles every iteration and does so 3 times), `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `s` will be the cumulative sum of `x` from each iteration, `n` will be divided by 2 three times (i.e., `n // 8`), `m` will be 8 (as it doubles every iteration and does so 3 times), `x` will be `(n + 1) // 2` based on the final value of `n`, and `k` remains an input integer as it was not modified within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
