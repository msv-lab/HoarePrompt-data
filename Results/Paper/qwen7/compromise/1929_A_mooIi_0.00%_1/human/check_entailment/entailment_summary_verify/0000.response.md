### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as required. The original program sorts the array and prints it as a string, which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements.

Let's analyze the provided function summary and the original program:

1. **Function Summary**: The function processes multiple test cases, reading an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list in ascending order and converts each integer to a string, then prints the sorted list as a single line of space-separated strings. This does not address the requirement to maximize the beauty of the array.

2. **Original Program**: The program reads the number of test cases, sorts the array, and prints the sorted array as a string. This does not compute the maximum beauty of the array.

The corrected version provided in the original assessment addresses the issue by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program is indeed incorrect, and the corrected version is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
