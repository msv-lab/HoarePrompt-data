### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem statement. The program sorts the array and prints it as a string, which is irrelevant to the calculation of the beauty defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

The original assessment also provides a corrected version of the program, which sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) are maximized, leading to the correct computation of the beauty.

Given the annotations and the corrected version provided, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed does not solve the problem correctly, and the corrected version does solve it correctly.

### Final:
**True**

The final evaluation is **True** because the original assessment accurately identified the issue with the provided program and correctly suggested a solution.
