Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program attempts to sort the array and then join the elements as strings, which does not address the requirement to maximize the beauty of the array.

To maximize the beauty, we need to ensure that the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in a specific order. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort()
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            beauty += abs(ar[i] - ar[i-1])
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This corrected program sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array.
