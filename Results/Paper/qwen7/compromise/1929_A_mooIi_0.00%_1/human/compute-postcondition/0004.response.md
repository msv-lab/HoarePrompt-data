Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list in ascending order and converts each integer to a string. Then, it prints the sorted list as a single line of space-separated strings. The function handles up to 500 test cases, with each test case containing between 2 and 100 integers, and each integer being between 1 and 10^9. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.**
