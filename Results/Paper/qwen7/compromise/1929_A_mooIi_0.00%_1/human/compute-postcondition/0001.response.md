Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a sequence of space-separated integers. These integers are the sorted versions of the input sequences provided for each test case. Each line corresponds to the sorted version of one test case's input sequence, with the integers converted to strings and joined by spaces. The number of lines will be equal to the number of test cases, which is determined by the first line of input (an integer t where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500).
