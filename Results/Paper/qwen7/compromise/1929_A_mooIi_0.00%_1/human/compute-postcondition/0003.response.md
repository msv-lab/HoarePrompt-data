Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns the results for each set of data based on the given conditions.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not specified in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the input structure and the nature of the data being processed.
