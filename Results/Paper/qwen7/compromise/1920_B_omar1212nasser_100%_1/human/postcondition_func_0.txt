The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and then calls the `func_2(k, x, a)` function to calculate a product based on the sorted list. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2(k, x, a)` for each test case.
