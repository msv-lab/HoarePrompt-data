Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the list `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` and then calls `func_2(k, x, a)`.
   - The function then prints the result of `func_2(k, x, a)` for each test case.
   
2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize the sum of the array, respectively.
   - It initializes `pos` with the sum of the array minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements.
   - It iteratively updates `s` (sum of the array) and `s2` (sum of the last `negatives` elements) by removing elements from the end of the array.
   - For each iteration, it appends the value of `s - 2 * s2` to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value in `pos`.

Given the problem description and the annotated functions, the logic in `func_2()` seems to correctly simulate the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Alice tries to maximize the sum by removing elements, and Bob tries to minimize the sum by negating elements. The function `func_2()` correctly handles these scenarios by considering different combinations of removals and negations.

Therefore, the overall logic of the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
