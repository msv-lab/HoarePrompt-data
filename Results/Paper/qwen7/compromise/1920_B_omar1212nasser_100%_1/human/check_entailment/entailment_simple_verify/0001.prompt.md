You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it.
   - Finally, it calls `func_2` with the sorted array and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `removals` (number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (the sorted array).
   - It initializes an empty list `pos` to store possible sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array.
   - It appends the initial sum minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements to `pos`.
   - It iterates from 1 to `removals`:
     - In each iteration, it subtracts the current element from `s` and `s2` (sum of the last `negatives` elements).
     - If there are enough elements left, it adds the next element to `s2`.
     - It appends the updated `s` minus twice the updated `s2` to `pos`.
   - It returns the maximum value in `pos`.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array helps in considering the smallest elements for removal and the largest elements for negation, which aligns with the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob.

2. **Calculating Possible Sums**:
   - The function considers different scenarios where Alice removes up to `removals` elements and Bob multiplies up to `negatives` elements by -1.
   - It correctly updates the sums by removing elements and adjusting the sum of the last `negatives` elements.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to minimize the impact on the total sum.
   - Bob should multiply the largest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum further.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `removals` or `negatives` are equal to `len(elements)`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
