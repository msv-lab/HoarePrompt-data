Output State: t is a positive integer, n is an input integer, q is the number of iterations the loop has executed, a is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in the original list a, b is a list of length n + 1 where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of a[i] (if a[i] > 1, then x = 1, otherwise x = 2), starting from b[0] = 0, the loop prints 'NO' if a[y] - a[x - 1] is less than b[y] - b[x - 1] or x equals y, otherwise it prints 'YES' for each iteration.
