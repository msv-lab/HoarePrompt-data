Output State: **`i` is the original value of `i` minus 2, `num` is the original value of `num` minus 2, `less` and `big` remain the same**

Explanation: The code `num -= 1` decrements the value of `num` by 1. Since `i` was already decremented by 1 in the initial state, both `i` and `num` are now each their original values minus 1 again, making them each their original values minus 2. The variables `less` and `big` are not affected by this operation.
