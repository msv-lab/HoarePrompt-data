Postcondition: `num` is equal to `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2 during the loop iterations, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1 during the loop iterations, `no` must contain at least one integer, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `x` is the last value read from the loop and it is not 1 or 2, `a` is the last value read from the loop and it is not in `less` or `big`, and the current value of `num` is either greater than or equal to 1, or `num` is less than 1 and `x` is not 1 or 2 and `a` is not in `less` or `big`. Additionally, `i` is within the range defined by `min(less)` and `max(big)`.
