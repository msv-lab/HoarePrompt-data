Output State: **`less` is a list containing `a`, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer with the current value of 2, `a` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `less`. Since `a` is an input integer, its specific value is not known, but it is added to the list `less`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
