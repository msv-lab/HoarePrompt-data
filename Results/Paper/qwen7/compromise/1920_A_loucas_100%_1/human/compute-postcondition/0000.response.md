Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, `t` retains its initial condition of being an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. The variable `loop` is now an integer obtained from user input.
