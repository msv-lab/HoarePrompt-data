Postcondition: `less`, `num`, `big`, and `no` are lists, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` equals 2, then `less` contains `a`, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `less` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, and `no` contains `[a]`.
