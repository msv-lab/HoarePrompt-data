Output State: **`less` is a list, `num` is an integer, `big` is a list, `no` is a list, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `iterable2` is incremented by 1, `innerLoop` remains the same**.

Explanation: The code `x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `a` respectively. The values of `less`, `num`, `big`, `no`, `iterable2`, and `innerLoop` remain unchanged from their initial states.
