Postcondition: `no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2. If `i` is a value that is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to the list `no` and the value of `num` remains unchanged.
