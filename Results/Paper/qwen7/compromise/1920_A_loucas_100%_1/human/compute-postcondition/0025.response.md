Output State: **`innerLoop` must be at least 1, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `a` is an input integer, the list `big` now contains this integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
