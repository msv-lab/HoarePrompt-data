Output State: **`x` is 1, `innerLoop` must be at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing `a`**.

The code appends the value of `a` (which is an input integer) to the list `big`. Since `big` was not defined before, it is initialized as a list containing the value of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
