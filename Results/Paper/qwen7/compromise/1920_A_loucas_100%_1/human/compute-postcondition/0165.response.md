Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `i` from the list `no`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is being iterated over the list `no`, the initial value of `i` must be the first element of the list `no`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `no` is not empty. If `no` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Consider the given state**: We know the following:
   - `num` is calculated as `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.
   - `no` is a list containing all values of `a` that were not 1 or 2.
   - `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where the corresponding `x` was 2.
   - `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where the corresponding `x` was 1.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `num` is not directly relevant to the loop's execution since the loop will continue even if `num` is less than 1.
   - The lists `less` and `big` are not directly relevant to the loop's execution since they do not affect whether `no` is empty.
   - The list `no` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `no` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2**, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where the corresponding `x` was 2, and `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where the corresponding `x` was 1.
