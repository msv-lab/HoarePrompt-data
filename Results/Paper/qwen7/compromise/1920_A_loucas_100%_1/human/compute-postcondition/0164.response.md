Postcondition: **`num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `no` is a list containing all values of `a` that were not 1 or 2, `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where the corresponding `x` was 2, and `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where the corresponding `x` was 1. If `num` is less than 1, the loop or iteration continues as it was.**
