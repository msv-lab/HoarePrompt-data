Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `num` will be decremented for each element in `no` that satisfies the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will retain their final states as they were after the last iteration of the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `num` will have been decremented for every element in the list `no` that meets the specified condition (`i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`). The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will reflect their state after the last iteration of the loop, meaning they will not be further modified.
