Output State: **`less` is an empty list, `num` remains unchanged, `big` is an empty list, `no` retains its final state**.

Explanation: The code initializes `big` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `less`, `num`, or `no`. Therefore, `less` remains an empty list, `num` remains unchanged, `big` becomes an empty list, and `no` retains its final state.
