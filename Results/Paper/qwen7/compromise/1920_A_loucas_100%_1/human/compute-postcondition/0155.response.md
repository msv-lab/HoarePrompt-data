Postcondition: `num` is 0, `no` is a list containing `a`, `less` is a list containing `a` or is empty, `big` is a list containing `a` or is empty, `no` remains empty, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is the integer value of the first input, `a` is the integer value of the second input.

Explanation: Whether `x` equals 2 or not, the final state of the lists `no`, `less`, and `big` will always include the value `a`. The list `no` will never contain any elements other than `a`. The lists `less` and `big` may or may not include `a`, depending on the condition. The variable `num` remains 0, and the other variables (`iterable2`, `x`, and `a`) retain their original values after the if-else block executes.
