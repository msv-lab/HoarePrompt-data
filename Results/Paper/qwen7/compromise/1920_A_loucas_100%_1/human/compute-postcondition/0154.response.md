Output State: **`num` is 0, `no` is a list containing `a`, `less` is a list containing `a`, `big` is a list containing `a`, `no` remains empty, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is the integer value of the first input, `a` is the integer value of the second input.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Initially, `no` is either a list containing `a` or is empty. After appending `a`, `no` now contains `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
