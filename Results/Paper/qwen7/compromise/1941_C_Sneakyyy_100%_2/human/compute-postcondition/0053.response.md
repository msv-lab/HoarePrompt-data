Postcondition: `ans` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is 6, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 6 and having length 3, if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 (or 0), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is 4, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 4 and having length 3.
