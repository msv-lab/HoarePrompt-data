Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(a) - 2`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is 1
   - `a` is a new string input by the user
   - `i` is 3
   - The substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'
3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < len(a) - 2` must be true.
   - Given that `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `len(a) - 2` must be greater than 3.
   - This implies that `len(a)` must be greater than 5.

Since the only variable involved in the loop condition is `i`, and we know `i` is 3, the length of the string `a` must be adjusted to ensure `i < len(a) - 2` holds true.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the length of the string `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 1, `a` is a new string input by the user and its length must be greater than 5, `i` is 3, and the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'**
