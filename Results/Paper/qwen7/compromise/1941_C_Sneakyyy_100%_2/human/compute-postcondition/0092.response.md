Postcondition: `ans` is 3, `a` is a new string input by the user and its length must be greater than 5, `i` is 7, `s` is 'map', and `len(a)` must be greater than 6, if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'. Otherwise, `ans` is 2, `a` is a new string input by the user and its length must be greater than 5, `i` is 5, `s` is 'map', and `len(a)` must be greater than 6.
