Output State: **`ans` is between 0 and the length of `a` divided by 3, inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, and `s` is the last possible substring of `a` of length 3, which is either 'map' or 'pie', or does not exist if no such substrings were found throughout the iterations.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`ans`, `a`, `i`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
