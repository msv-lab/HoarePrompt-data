You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` of lowercase Latin letters with length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it counts and prints the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' within the string `s`. After processing all test cases, it prints the count for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from the string `s` to eliminate the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The provided function iterates through the string and checks for the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function takes an integer `t` as input, which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string `a` and the string itself.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of deletions needed.
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the string up to the third last character (`len(a) - 2`).
   - In each iteration, it checks the substring of length 3 starting at index `i`.
   - If the substring is "pie" or "map", it increments `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1.
   - Otherwise, it increments `i` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles overlapping substrings because it always moves `i` by 3 when it finds "pie" or "map".
   - It also correctly handles cases where the string does not contain "pie" or "map" by setting `ans` to 0.
   - The function correctly handles the end of the string by stopping the loop at `len(a) - 2`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in the function is sound and correctly counts the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
   - The function handles all specified edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct.
