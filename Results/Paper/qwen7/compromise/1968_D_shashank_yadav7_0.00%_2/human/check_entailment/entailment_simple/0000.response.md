Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, followed by the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Position Adjustment**: The starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` are adjusted by subtracting 1, which is necessary because list indices in Python start at 0.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation**: The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are set to the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively. The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are initialized to these values multiplied by `k`.

4. **Game Loop**: The loop iterates `n` times, updating the positions `b` and `s` to their respective `p[b]` and `p[s]` values, and recalculating the scores `bm` and `sm` based on the maximum possible scores at each step. This ensures that the scores account for the best possible moves at each turn.

5. **Output Determination**: After the loop, the program compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, Bodya wins; if `sm` is greater, Sasha wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where the game might end early due to `k` becoming 0 before completing `n` iterations, but since the loop breaks when `k` becomes 0, this is handled correctly.

Given that the program follows the logic described in the problem statement and handles all aspects correctly, the program is logically sound and should produce the correct output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
