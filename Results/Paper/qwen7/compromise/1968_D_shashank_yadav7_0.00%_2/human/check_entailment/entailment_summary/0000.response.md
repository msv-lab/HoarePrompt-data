Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary parameters and initializes the starting positions for Bodya (`b`) and Sasha (`s`).
3. The program then enters a loop to simulate the game for `k` turns.
4. Inside the loop, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
5. It calculates the scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) by considering the maximum possible score at each turn.
6. After the loop, it compares the final scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Upon reviewing the logic and the steps taken in the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. The logic for updating positions and calculating scores seems accurate.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
