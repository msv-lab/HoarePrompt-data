Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(t)` statement. The only variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to `n - 1 + 1 = n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `n`.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `t` remains unchanged (as it is not modified within the loop head).

Given these steps, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `bm` is the sum of `bm` and the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * (-1) + bp + a[b]`, `sm` is the sum of `sm` and the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * (-1) + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and if `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` remains unchanged; otherwise, `bm` equals `sm`**.
