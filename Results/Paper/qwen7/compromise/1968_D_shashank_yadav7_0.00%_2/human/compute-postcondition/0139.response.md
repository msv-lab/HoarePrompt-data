Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 2`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or block it is within. In this case, it exits the loop or block where the variables `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, and others might have been updated. However, since the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables, the values of `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `i`, `n`, and the condition involving `bm` and `sm` remain unchanged except for `b` being decreased by 1.
