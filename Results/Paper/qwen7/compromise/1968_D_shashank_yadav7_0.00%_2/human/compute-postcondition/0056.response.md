Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the value `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < t`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` equals `n`
   - `k` equals 0
   - `b` and `s` are updated as described
   - `bm` and `sm` reflect the maximum values calculated during the last iteration
   - Both `sp` and `bp` have been incremented accordingly
   - `bm` is either greater than or equal to `sm`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < t`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - The other variables (`k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

4. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be `n + 1`
   - `k` remains `0`
   - `b` and `s` remain as updated from the previous iteration
   - `bm` and `sm` remain as the maximum values from the previous iteration
   - `sp` and `bp` remain incremented from the previous iteration
   - `bm` remains either greater than or equal to `sm`

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `k` is 0, `b` and `s` are updated as described, `bm` and `sm` reflect the maximum values calculated during the last iteration, both `sp` and `bp` have been incremented accordingly, and `bm` is either greater than or equal to `sm`**.
