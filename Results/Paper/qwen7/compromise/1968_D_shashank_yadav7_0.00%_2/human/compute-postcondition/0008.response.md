Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is the input integer decreased by 1, `s` is the input integer decreased by 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `sp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `s` and ending before `s + 1`, `bp` is the element at index `b` in list `a`.**

This means that the variable `bp` has been assigned the value of the element at index `b` in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
