Output State: **`k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 3`, `bm` is `3 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] * 2 + sp`, `bp` is `4 * a[b]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The line `bp += a[b]` adds the value of `a[b]` to `bp`. Since `bp` was previously `a[b] + a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, it now becomes `4 * a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
