Output State: **`k` is decreased by 4, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 2, `sm` is increased by the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] * 2`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]` + `a[b]` (which is `2 * a[b]`), `i` is 1, `b` is `p[b]` - 1, `bm` is increased by the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`**

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increases `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Since `bp` was previously increased by `a[b]` before this line, now `bp` is increased by `2 * a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
