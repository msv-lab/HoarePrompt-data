Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is explicitly given as `-1`.
- `b` is defined as `p[p[b] - 1] - n + 1`. Since `b` is used in this formula, let's assume `b` is an index into the list `p`. Without the actual content of `p`, we cannot determine the exact value of `b`, but we know it will be computed from the list `p` and the value of `n`.
- `s` is defined as `p[p[s] - 1] - n`. Similarly, `s` is also an index into the list `p` and will be computed accordingly.
- `bm` is defined as `n * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. Given `k = -1`, this simplifies to `n * max(bm, a[b] * (-1) + bp)`.
- `sm` is defined as `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm) + (n-1) * max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. Again, with `k = -1`, this simplifies to `a[s] * (-1) + max(a[s] * (-1) + sp, sm) + (n-1) * max(sm, a[s] * (-1) + sp)`.
- `sp` is defined as `a[s] * n + sp`. This depends on the value of `a[s]` and `n`.
- `bp` is defined as `4 * a[b] * (n-1)`. This depends on the value of `a[b]` and `n`.
- `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is greater than 0.
- `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, and `bm` is less than `sm`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('Sasha')
```

The output will be the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **'Sasha'**
