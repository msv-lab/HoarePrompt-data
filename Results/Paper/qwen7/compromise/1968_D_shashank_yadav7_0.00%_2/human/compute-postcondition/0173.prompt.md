Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other variables (n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a) remain in their initial state.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b -= 1
    s -= 1
    sp = a[s]
    bp = a[b]
    bm = a[b] * k
    sm = a[s] * k
    for i in range(n):
        k -= 1
        if k == 0:
            break
        b = p[b] - 1
        s = p[s] - 1
        bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
        sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
        sp += a[s]
        bp += a[b]
    if bm > sm:
        print('Bodya')
    elif bm < sm:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` equals `n`, `k` equals 0, `b` and `s` are updated as described, `bm` and `sm` reflect the maximum values calculated during the last iteration, and both `sp` and `bp` have been incremented accordingly. Additionally, `bm` is either greater than or equal to `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 1`, `bm` is the sum of `bm` and the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * (-1) + bp + a[b]`, `sm` is the sum of `sm` and the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * (-1) + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and if `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` remains unchanged; otherwise, `bm` equals `sm`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - n + 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - n`, `bm` is `n * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm) + (n-1) * max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] * n + sp`, `bp` is `4 * a[b] * (n-1)`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
