Output State: **`bm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is 0, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `sm` is increased by the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`.**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
