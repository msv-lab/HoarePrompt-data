Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `bm` plus the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is `sm` plus the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`**

Explanation: 
- The value of `sp` is incremented by `a[s]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`) remain unchanged from their previous values as specified in the initial state.
