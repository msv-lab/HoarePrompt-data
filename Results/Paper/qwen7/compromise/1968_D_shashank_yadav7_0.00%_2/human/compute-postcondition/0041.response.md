Output State: **`i` is 0, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is increased by the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bm` is increased by the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, `k` is decreased by 1, and `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, `bm` is increased by the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * (k-1) + bp`, `sm` is now also increased by the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.**

Explanation: The given code snippet updates `sm` by adding the maximum value between its current value (`sm`) and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
