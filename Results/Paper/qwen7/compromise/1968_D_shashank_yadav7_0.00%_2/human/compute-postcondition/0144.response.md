Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[p[s] - 1] - 2 - 1`, `bm` is `2 * max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `a[s] * k + max(a[s] * k + sp, sm)`, `sp` is `a[s] + (a[s] + sp)`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than 0, and `bm` is greater than `sm` or `bm` equals `sm` depending on the values of `bm` and `sm`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `bm` is updated by adding `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` to its current value. Since `k` is -1 and `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, the term `a[b] * k + bp` simplifies to `-a[b] + a[b] + a[b] + a[b]`, which further simplifies to `a[b]`. Therefore, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b])`. This results in `bm` being doubled if `a[b]` is greater than or equal to `bm`, otherwise, it remains unchanged.
