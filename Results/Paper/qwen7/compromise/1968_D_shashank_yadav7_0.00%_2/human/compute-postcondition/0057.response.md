Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `b` and `s` are updated as described by the input, `bm` and `sm` reflect the maximum values calculated during the last iteration, both `sp` and `bp` have been incremented accordingly, and `bm` is either greater than or equal to `sm`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` respectively. The initial values of `k`, `b`, and `s` are updated to these new values. The values of `bm` and `sm` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the input. Similarly, `sp` and `bp` are also unaffected. The condition that `bm` is either greater than or equal to `sm` remains true.
