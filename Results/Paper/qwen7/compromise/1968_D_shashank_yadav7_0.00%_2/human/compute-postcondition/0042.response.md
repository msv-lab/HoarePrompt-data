Output State: **`i` is 0, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is increased by the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, `bm` is increased by the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp + a[b]`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, `k` is decreased by 1, and `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, `bm` is increased by the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * (k-1) + bp`, `sm` is now also increased by the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]**.

Explanation:
- The code `sp += a[s]` increases `sp` by `a[s]`. Since `sp` was previously `a[s] + sp`, it now becomes `a[s] + a[s] + sp`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
