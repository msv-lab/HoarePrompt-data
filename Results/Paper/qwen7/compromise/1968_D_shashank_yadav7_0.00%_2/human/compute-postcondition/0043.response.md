Output State: **`i` is 0, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is increased by the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, `bm` is increased by the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp + a[b]`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, `bm` is increased by the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * (k-1) + bp + a[b]`, `sm` is increased by the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]; `bp` is increased by `a[b]`.**

This output state reflects the changes made by the code snippet. Specifically, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`, which is already included in the previous conditions. All other variables maintain their respective changes as described in the initial state.
