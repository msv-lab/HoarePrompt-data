Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is the input integer decreased by 1, `s` is the input integer decreased by 1, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `sp` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `s` and ending before `s + 1`, `bp` is the element at index `b` in list `a`, `bm` is the element at index `b` in list `a` multiplied by `k`, `sm` is the element at index `s` in list `a` multiplied by `k`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[s] * k` to `sm`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `sm` is updated to be the product of the element at index `s` in list `a` and `k`. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
