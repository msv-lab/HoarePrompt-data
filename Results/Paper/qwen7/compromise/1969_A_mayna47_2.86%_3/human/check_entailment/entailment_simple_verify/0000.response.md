### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Input Handling:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   v = [0] * (n + 1)
   v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   - `n` is the number of friends.
   - `v` is initialized to a list of length `n+1` with all elements set to `0`.
   - The next line updates `v` to include the actual best friends' indices starting from index `1`.

2. **Case for `n == 2`**:
   ```python
   if n == 2:
       print(2)
   ```
   - If `n` is 2, the program directly prints `2`, which is correct because both friends will come if invited individually.

3. **General Case (`n > 2`)**:
   ```python
   else:
       for i in range(1, n + 1):
           if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
               print(2)
               return
   ```
   - The program iterates over each friend `i` from `1` to `n`.
   - It checks if the friend `i` and their best friend's best friend's best friend is `i` itself, indicating a cycle of length 3.
   - If such a cycle is found, it prints `2` and returns, ensuring that only two friends need to be invited.

4. **Default Case**:
   ```python
   print(3)
   ```
   - If no such cycle is found, the program prints `3`, meaning at least three friends need to be invited to ensure at least two friends come to the party.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
- The program handles the special case of `n == 2` correctly.
- The general case logic is sound and ensures that cycles of length 3 are detected, leading to the correct output of `2` when applicable.
- The default case of printing `3` is also correct, as it ensures that at least three friends are invited in cases where no cycle of length 3 exists.

Given the analysis, the program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies cycles of length 3 and ensures that at least two friends come to the party by inviting the necessary number of friends.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
