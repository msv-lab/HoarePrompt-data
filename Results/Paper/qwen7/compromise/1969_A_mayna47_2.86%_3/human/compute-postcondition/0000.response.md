Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, n is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `t` and the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000` remain unchanged. Similarly, the list `p` and its conditions remain unaffected. The only change is that `n` now holds the value of the integer input.
