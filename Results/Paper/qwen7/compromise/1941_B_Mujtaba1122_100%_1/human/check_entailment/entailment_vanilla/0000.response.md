### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array `a` equal to zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 \le i \le n-1`) and performing the following assignments:
     - `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1`

2. **Analyzing the Given Functions:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
     - It returns `False` if any element is non-zero, otherwise `True`.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function attempts to reduce the array elements to zero using the specified operation.
     - It iterates through the array from index `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
     - For each index `i`, it checks if the conditions allow the operation to be applied (`list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`).
     - If the conditions are met, it performs the operation and updates the array.
     - If at any point an index `i-1` is found to be non-zero after the operation, it prints 'NO' and returns.
     - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_2` seems to correctly implement the operation and check if the array can be made zero.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the way the operation is applied. Specifically, the operation should be applied in such a way that the total reduction matches the initial values.
   - The current implementation assumes that the operation can always be applied as long as the conditions are met, but it does not ensure that the total reduction matches the initial values correctly.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's verify the example provided:
     - For the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`:
       - Applying the operation at `i=4` results in `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=3` results in `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=2` results in `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=4` results in `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
       - The function correctly identifies that it is possible to make all elements zero.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Despite the potential issues with the logic, the provided functions seem to handle the example correctly. However, without further rigorous testing and analysis, it is difficult to definitively say if the function is always correct for all cases.

### Final Answer:
Given the provided example and the logic implemented, the function appears to work correctly for the given example. However, due to the complexity and the potential edge cases, it is recommended to perform additional testing to ensure correctness.

**Correctness: **False** (Pending further verification)**
