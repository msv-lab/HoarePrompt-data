### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- It correctly iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds a non-zero element.
- It returns `True` only if all elements are zero.
- This function works as expected.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function processes the list according to the specified operations.
- It iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
- For each index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`), it checks if `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
- If these conditions are met, it performs the operations:
  - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
  - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
  - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
- After processing, it checks if `list[i-1]` is non-zero and prints "NO" if so.
- Finally, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
- The function `func_2` ensures that operations are only applied to valid indices (where `2 <= i <= n-1`).
- The operations are performed correctly based on the problem description.
- The final check with `func_1` ensures that the list is all zeros before printing the result.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate. The provided code correctly implements the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. The function `func_2` handles the operations correctly and ensures that only valid indices are processed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
