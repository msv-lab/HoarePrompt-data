### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array `a` equal to zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 \le i \le n-1`) and performing the following assignments:
     - `a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1`

2. **Analyzing the Given Functions:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
     - It returns `False` if any element is non-zero, otherwise `True`.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - This function attempts to reduce the array elements to zero using the specified operation.
     - It iterates through the array from index `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
     - For each index `i`, it checks if the conditions allow the operation to be applied (`list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`).
     - If the conditions are met, it performs the operation and updates the array.
     - If at any point an index `i-1` is found to be non-zero after the operation, it prints 'NO' and returns.
     - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_2` seems to correctly implement the operation and check if the array can be made zero.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the way the operation is applied. Specifically, the operation should be applied in such a way that the total reduction matches the initial values.
   - The current implementation assumes that the operation can always be applied as long as the conditions are met, but it does not ensure that the total reduction matches the initial values correctly.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's verify the example provided:
     - For the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`:
       - Applying the operation at `i=4` results in `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=3` results in `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=2` results in `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`.
       - Applying the operation at `i=4` results in `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
       - The function correctly identifies that it is possible to make all elements zero.

5. **Edge Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`:
     - Applying the operation at `i=3` results in `[2, 4, 3, 3, 1]`.
     - Applying the operation at `i=2` results in `[2, 3, 2, 2, 1]`.
     - Applying the operation at `i=1` results in `[1, 2, 1, 1, 1]`.
     - Applying the operation at `i=2` results in `[1, 1, 0, 1, 1]`.
     - Applying the operation at `i=3` results in `[1, 1, -1, 0, 1]`.
     - At this point, the array cannot be reduced further because the conditions for the operation are not met, and some elements are negative.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_2` does not handle cases where the array becomes negative or cannot be reduced further correctly. The function assumes that the operation can always be applied as long as the conditions are met, which is not always true.
   - The function `func_1` only checks if all elements are zero, but it does not ensure that the array can be reduced to zero using the specified operations.

### Final Answer:
Given the edge case analysis and the potential issues with the logic, the function is not always correct. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
