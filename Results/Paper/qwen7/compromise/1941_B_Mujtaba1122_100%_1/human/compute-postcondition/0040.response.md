Output State: **All elements in the list must be changed such that `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 1`**

Explanation: The code decreases the value of `list[i + 1]` by `1 * list[i - 1]`, which means `list[i + 1]` is reduced by the value of `list[i - 1]`. The conditions for the other elements (`list[i]` and `list[i - 1]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `list[i - 1]` must still be greater than 0, and `list[i + 1]` must now be greater than 1 (since it was originally greater than 0 and was decreased by a positive value).
