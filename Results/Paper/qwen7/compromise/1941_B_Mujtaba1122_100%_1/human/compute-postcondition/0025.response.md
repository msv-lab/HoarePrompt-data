Output State: **`list[i]` is now 2, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` is now `list[i + 1] - list[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The code subtracts `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`. Since `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, it is used in the calculation, and the new value of `list[i + 1]` is updated accordingly. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
