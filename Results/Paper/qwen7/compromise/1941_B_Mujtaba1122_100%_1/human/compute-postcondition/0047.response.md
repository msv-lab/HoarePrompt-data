Output State: **`list[i - 1]` is now equal to `list[i - 1] - list[i - 1]`, which is 0, and `list[i]` is decreased by 2 times `list[i - 1]` as per the initial condition.**

Explanation: The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` subtracts `list[i - 1]` from itself, effectively setting `list[i - 1]` to 0. The initial condition that `list[i]` is decreased by 2 times `list[i - 1]` still holds true, but since `list[i - 1]` is now 0, the value of `list[i]` remains unchanged.
