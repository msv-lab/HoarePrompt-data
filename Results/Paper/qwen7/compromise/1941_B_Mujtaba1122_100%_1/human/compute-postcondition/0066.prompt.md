You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array a, and n is the length of the array such that 3 <= n <= 2 \* 10^5. Each element in the array is an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: All elements in the list are 0 or negative, with `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` all being 0. The loop terminates because none of the conditions inside the while loop are satisfied, as all relevant elements in the list have been reduced to 0 or below.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, every element in the list will be 0 or a negative number, but specifically, the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` will all be exactly 0.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: All elements in the list are 0 or negative, with `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` all being 0. The loop terminates because none of the conditions inside the while loop are satisfied, as all relevant elements in the list have been reduced to 0 or below. Additionally, the function `func_1(list, n)` returns the same boolean value in both cases (True if the if part is executed, and False if the else part is executed).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `list`, which is a list of integers, and another parameter `n`, which represents the length of the list. There is no return value since the provided code snippet does not contain any return statements.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet.

Case_2: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code.

Case_3: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
