t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
