Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

                        kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                        kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                    else:
                        kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                        kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        
        print(kq1)
        
        print(kq2)
        
    #State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `a` and `b` are the new input strings after all iterations, `kq1` is the final concatenated string containing the minimum value (as a character) of each pair of corresponding characters from strings `a` and `b`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i-1])` and `int(b[i-1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i-1])` and `int(b[i-1])`, and `kq2` is the final concatenated string containing the maximum value (as a character) of each pair of corresponding characters from strings `a` and `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple pairs of input strings `a` and `b`, each representing integers of the same length consisting of digits from 1 to 9. For each pair, it constructs two new strings: `kq1` containing the minimum digit from each corresponding position of `a` and `b`, and `kq2` containing the maximum digit from each corresponding position. It then prints these two strings for each pair.
