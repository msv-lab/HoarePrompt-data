The function processes multiple pairs of input strings `a` and `b`, each representing integers of the same length consisting of digits from 1 to 9. For each pair, it constructs two new strings: `kq1` containing the minimum digit from each corresponding position of `a` and `b`, and `kq2` containing the maximum digit from each corresponding position. It then prints these two strings for each pair.
