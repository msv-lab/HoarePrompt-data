Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `vt` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `vt` is assigned the value 1. None of the other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
