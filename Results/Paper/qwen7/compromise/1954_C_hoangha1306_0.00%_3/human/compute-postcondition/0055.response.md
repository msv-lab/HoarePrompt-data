Output State: **`i` is 2, `kq2` is `kq2 + a[2]` and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `i` or `kq2`, and the statement `kq2 = kq2 + a[2]` was part of a condition that might not have been met (as it's not shown in the snippet), the value of `kq2` remains as it was before the `continue` statement.
