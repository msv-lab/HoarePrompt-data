Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that are constructed based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x` (where `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`), and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `y` (where `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`). If `a[i] <= b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` remains as the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `y`. `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is 1, and `x` and `y` are the minimum and maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` respectively.
