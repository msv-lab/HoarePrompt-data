Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is less than or equal to `-1`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `q` is `t`, `vt` is `0`, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, `kq2` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is either the string `a[0]` or the string `b[0]`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `kq2` is the string `b[0]` if `a[0] <= b[0]`, otherwise `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` and the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are new input strings, `kq1` is the string `a[0]` concatenated with `a[1]`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` and the string representation of `a[2]`. We continue the loop or statement we were inside.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are new input strings, `kq1` is the string `a[0]` concatenated with `a[1]` followed by either `a[3]` or the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` with either the string representation of `a[2]` or `x` if `vt == 0`, otherwise with the string representation of `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
