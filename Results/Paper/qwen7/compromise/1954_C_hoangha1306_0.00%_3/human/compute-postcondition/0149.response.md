Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `q` is `t`, `vt` is `0`, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, `kq2` is an empty string, the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`**
