Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are new input strings, `kq1` is the string `a[0]` concatenated with `a[1]` followed by either `a[3]` or the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `q` is `t`, `vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq2` is the concatenation of the string `kq2` with either the string representation of `a[2]` or `x` if `vt == 0`, otherwise with the string representation of `y`.
