Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `q` is `len(b)`, and `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that are constructed based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `kq1` is `a[i]` and `kq2` is `a[len(b) - 1]`. If `a[i] > b[i]`, `kq1` is the concatenation of `kq1` and the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` remains unchanged and `kq2` is the concatenation of `kq2` and the string representation of `x`. `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is either 0 or 1, `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `len(b) - 2`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is either 0 or 1, `x` is `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, `kq1` is `kq1 + a[i]` and `kq2` is `kq2 + a[i]`. Otherwise, if `vt` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` is the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `min(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))`; otherwise, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` concatenated with `str(y)`. `kq2` is updated by concatenating `str(x)` if `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, or `str(y)` if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `len(b) - 2`, `a` and `b` are the new input strings, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is either 0 or 1, `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 1 - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1 - 1]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 1 - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1 - 1]))`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each incremented by `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(x)` and `kq2` to `kq2 + str(y)`. If `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, `kq1` is updated to the original `kq1` plus the string representation of `max(int(a[len(b) - 1 - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1 - 1]))` and `kq2` to `kq2 + str(x).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
