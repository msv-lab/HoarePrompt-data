Output State: **`x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The initial states of `x` and `y` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
