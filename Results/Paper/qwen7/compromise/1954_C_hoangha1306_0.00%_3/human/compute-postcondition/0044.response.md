Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[1])` and `int(b[1])`, `vt` is 1, `kq1` is a string containing either the value of `x` or `y` (depending on whether `a[i] > b[i]`), and `kq2` is a string containing either the value of `y` concatenated with itself or the value of `x` appended to it (depending on whether `a[i] > b[i]`).
