Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `a`, `b`, `kq1`, `kq2`, `q`, `vt`, `x`, and `y`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `len(b) - 1`.
   - `a` is the new input string.
   - `b` is the new input string.
   - `kq1` and `kq2` are strings constructed based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
   - `q` is `len(b)`.
   - `vt` is either 0 or 1.
   - `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`.
   - `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `len(b) - 1` and the loop iterates over `range(len(a))`, the next value of `i` will be `len(b) - 2`.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]` in the loop body.
   - `q` remains `len(b)` as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `vt` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `x` and `y` are recalculated based on the new value of `i` (which is `len(b) - 2`).

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `len(b) - 2`.
- `a` is the new input string.
- `b` is the new input string.
- `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- `q` is `len(b)`.
- `vt` is either 0 or 1.
- `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 2]), int(b[len(b) - 2]))`.
- `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 2]), int(b[len(b) - 2]))`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `len(b) - 2`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is either 0 or 1, `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 2]), int(b[len(b) - 2]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 2]), int(b[len(b) - 2]))**.
