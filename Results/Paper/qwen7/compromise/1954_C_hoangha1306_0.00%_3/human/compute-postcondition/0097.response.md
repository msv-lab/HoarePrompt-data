Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, `a` is the new input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is a string containing either `str(x)` or `str(y)` depending on the comparison result, `kq2` is a string containing either `str(y)` or `str(x)` depending on the comparison result, `q` is `len(b)`, `vt` is 1, `x` is `min(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`, `y` is `max(int(a[len(b) - 1]), int(b[len(b) - 1]))`, and the function updates `kq1` and `kq2` based on whether `a[i]` is greater than or less than or equal to `b[i]`.
