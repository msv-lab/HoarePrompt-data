You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: Output State: The string `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`, or for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, then `b[i]` must be equal to `c[i]`.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (between 1 and 20), and two strings `a` and `b` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, along with a third string `c` also consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. It checks whether `c` is either equal to `a` or `b`, or for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, then `b[i]` must be equal to `c[i]`. If any index `i` violates this condition, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` integers within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, stored in the `results` list, where each integer is the result of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for corresponding inputs `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: 1000 integers, each identical to the corresponding integer in the `results` list, printed on separate lines.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). It then calls another function `func_1` with these inputs and stores the result. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, one per line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The function `func_1` only checks if there is at least one position where both `a` and `b` do not match `c`. However, this is not sufficient to determine the existence of a valid template `t`.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- String `a` is "aa".
- String `b` is "bb".
- String `c` is "ab".

In this case, the function `func_1` would return "YES" because at the first position, `a[0]` ('a') does not match `c[0]` ('a'), and `b[0]` ('b') does not match `c[0]` ('a'). However, there is no valid template `t` that satisfies the conditions for both `a` and `b` but fails for `c`. A valid template `t` could be "AA" or "BB", which would make both `a` and `b` match but `c` not match.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
