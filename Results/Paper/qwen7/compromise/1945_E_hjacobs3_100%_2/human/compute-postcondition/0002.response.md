Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `r - l > 1`.
2. **Determine the current state of the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `r - l > 1` must be true.
   - Given that `l` is 0, the condition simplifies to `r - 0 > 1`, which means `r > 1`.

4. **Check the current value of `r`**:
   - Currently, `r` is `n`.

5. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - Since `l` is fixed at 0, the only variable that can be adjusted is `r`.
   - To satisfy the condition `r - l > 1`, `r` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted such that `r` is greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n; `l` is 0; `r` must be greater than 1**
