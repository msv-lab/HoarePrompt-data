Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of input strings sorted in ascending order, `suma` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the original `numbers` list, `b` is the integer value of the first element in the original `numbers` list.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the `numbers` list and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `b`. The value of `a` is the integer value of the first element in the original `numbers` list, which remains unchanged as it was used to initialize `b`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
