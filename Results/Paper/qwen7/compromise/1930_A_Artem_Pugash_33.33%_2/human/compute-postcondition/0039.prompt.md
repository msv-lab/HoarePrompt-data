Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of input strings sorted in ascending order, `suma` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while numbers != []:
    a = int(numbers.pop(0))
    b = int(numbers.pop(0))
    suma += min(a, b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of input strings sorted in ascending order, `suma` is the original `suma` plus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the `numbers` list, `b` is the integer value of the first element in the `numbers` list after it is popped from the list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of input strings sorted in ascending order and now one element less than before, `suma` is the original `suma` plus the minimum of `a` and `b`, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was popped from the `numbers` list, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was just popped from the `numbers` list, `suma` is updated by adding the minimum of `a` and `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is the original `numbers` list with its first element removed, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was popped from the `numbers` list, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was popped from the `numbers` list, `suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus the minimum of `a` and `b`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
