Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is the original `numbers` list with its first element removed, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was popped from the `numbers` list, `b` is the integer value of the second element that was popped from the `numbers` list, `suma` is the previous value of `suma` plus the minimum of `a` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code updates `suma` by adding the minimum value between `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are the integer values of the first two elements that were popped from the `numbers` list, `suma` now includes this minimum value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
