Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values within a defined range for `t` and `n`, and an array of `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`. It returns a result based on the conditions specified for `t` and `n`, and the values of the integers on the whiteboard.**

This means the function implicitly works with `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and an array of `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (each `a_i` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The exact nature of the return value depends on the specific logic implemented within the function body, but based on the given constraints, it processes these inputs to produce some output.
