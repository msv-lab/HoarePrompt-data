Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly describes the behavior of the provided function. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Sorting**: The numbers are sorted in ascending order. This ensures that when we take pairs of numbers, the smaller number is always chosen first, maximizing the cumulative sum of the minimum values.

3. **Pairwise Sum Calculation**: The function correctly pairs the smallest available numbers and sums their minimum values. Since the list is sorted, the minimum value in each pair is always the first element of the pair, and the larger value is the second element. The function adds the minimum value to the cumulative sum and then removes both elements from the list.

4. **Loop Termination**: The loop continues until all elements are processed, ensuring that all pairs are considered.

5. **Output**: The function prints the cumulative sum for each test case, which is the maximum final score achievable according to the problem statement.

Given these points, the function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
