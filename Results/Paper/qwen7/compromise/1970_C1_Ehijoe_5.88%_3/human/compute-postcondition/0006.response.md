Output State: **`empty` is False, `t` remains the same, `u` and `v` are updated based on the last input, `n` remains the same, and `tree` is a deque containing integers after processing all inputs. The `tree` deque will now contain the integer `start` added to the end.**

Explanation: The code `start = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `start`. Since `empty` was initially `False`, adding `start` to the `tree` deque does not change the `empty` status. The values of `t`, `u`, `v`, and `n` remain unchanged. The `tree` deque now contains the integer `start` added to its end.
