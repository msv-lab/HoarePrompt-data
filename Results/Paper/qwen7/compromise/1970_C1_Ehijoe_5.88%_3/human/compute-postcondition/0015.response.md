Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies the existence of certain variables (n, t, u, v, and a list of starting nodes) with specific constraints. It returns either an error message indicating that the input does not meet the required conditions or a specific value based on the given constraints.**

This means the function `func_1` does not accept any parameters through its definition, but it relies on external variables `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and a list of starting nodes that must satisfy certain conditions. The function checks these conditions and returns an appropriate result or error message based on whether the conditions are met.
