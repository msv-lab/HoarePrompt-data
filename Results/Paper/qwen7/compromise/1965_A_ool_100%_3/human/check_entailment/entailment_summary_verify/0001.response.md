### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function `func_1` based on the provided problem description and the function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes an array `arr` as input and returns the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob').
   - **Step 1:** Convert the array to a set and sort it to get unique pile sizes in ascending order.
     - This step is unnecessary because the original array already contains unique values due to the problem constraints.
   - **Step 2:** Check if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone.
     - If the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice can always win by removing 1 stone from each pile, making the smallest pile size 1. Hence, the function returns 'Alice'.
   - **Step 3:** Iterate through the sorted unique pile sizes to check if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is exactly 1.
     - If any difference is greater than 1, the function immediately returns 'Bob' because this indicates a losing position for the current player.
     - Otherwise, toggle the boolean variable `A` to alternate between 'Alice' and 'Bob'.
   - **Step 4:** Return 'Alice' if the last value of `A` is True, otherwise return 'Bob'.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Initial Check:**
   - The check for the smallest pile being greater than 1 is correct and ensures Alice can always win in such scenarios.

2. **Iterative Check:**
   - The iterative check for differences between consecutive pile sizes is a simplified version of the XOR strategy used in the Nim Game theory. However, the implementation of this check is flawed. The function should be checking the XOR of the pile sizes, not their differences.

3. **Boolean Toggle:**
   - The toggling of the boolean `A` is incorrect because it does not accurately simulate the XOR strategy. The XOR strategy is based on the parity of the number of piles with odd sizes, not a simple toggle.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Nim Game Theory:**
  - In the Nim Game, the winning condition is determined by the XOR of the pile sizes. If the XOR of all pile sizes is 0, the second player (Bob) wins; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

- **Correct Implementation:**
  - Instead of checking the differences, the function should compute the XOR of all pile sizes.
  - If the XOR is 0, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    xor_sum = 0
    for pile_size in arr:
        xor_sum ^= pile_size
    return 'Alice' if xor_sum else 'Bob'
```

### Conclusion:

The original function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not implement the correct logic based on the Nim Game theory. The original assessment was inaccurate.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the winner based on the Nim Game theory.
