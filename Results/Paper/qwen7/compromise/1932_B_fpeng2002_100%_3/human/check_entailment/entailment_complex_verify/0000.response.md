### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to understand its behavior and compare it with the problem description.

#### Problem Description:
- The Chaya tribe waits for each subsequent sign to occur strictly after the previous one.
- For each sign, the tribe waits for the next occurrence of that sign after the previous one has occurred.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- It initializes `start_year` to 0.
- It then iterates over the periodicities and updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial State**: `start_year` is initialized to 0.
2. **First Iteration**:
   - If `start_year` is 0, the formula `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]` becomes `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, which simplifies to `1 * nums[0] = nums[0]`.
   - So, `start_year` becomes `nums[0]`.
3. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - In each iteration, `start_year` is updated to the next occurrence of the current sign after the previous one has occurred.
   - This ensures that the tribe waits for the next occurrence of the sign strictly after the previous one.

Let's verify this with the example provided in the problem statement:
- Input: `6\n3 2 4 5 9 18`
- Initial `start_year` is 0.
- First iteration: `start_year` becomes `3` (the first sign occurs in year 3).
- Second iteration: `start_year` becomes `4` (the second sign occurs in year 4, after the first sign).
- Third iteration: `start_year` becomes `8` (the third sign occurs in year 8, after the second sign).
- Fourth iteration: `start_year` becomes `10` (the fourth sign occurs in year 10, after the third sign).
- Fifth iteration: `start_year` becomes `18` (the fifth sign occurs in year 18, after the fourth sign).
- Sixth iteration: `start_year` becomes `36` (the sixth sign occurs in year 36, after the fifth sign).

This matches the expected sequence of years as described in the problem statement.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic of waiting for each subsequent sign to occur strictly after the previous one. The annotated code and the reasoning confirm that the program is indeed correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
