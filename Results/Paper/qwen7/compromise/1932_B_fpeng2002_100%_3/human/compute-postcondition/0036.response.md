Output State: **`start_year` is `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`, `x` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `start_year` is updated to the value of `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Since `x` is 0, `nums[x]` refers to the first element of the list `nums`. The value of `start_year` is recalculated based on its current value and the first element of `nums`. The value of `x` remains unchanged at 0.
