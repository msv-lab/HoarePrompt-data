Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is set to `len(nums) - 1`, meaning `x` is the index of the last element in the list `nums`.
- `start_year` is calculated by successively applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the list `nums`, starting from the first element and moving towards the last one.

Let's break down the calculation of `start_year` step-by-step:

1. Start with `start_year` (let's assume an initial value for `start_year` since it's not explicitly given).
2. For each element `nums[i]` in the list, update `start_year` as follows:
   - Compute `(start_year // nums[i] + 1)`.
   - Multiply the result by `nums[i]`.

Given this process, the final value of `start_year` will be the result of applying the above operation iteratively over all elements in `nums`.

Since the exact value of `start_year` is not provided, we can represent it in a general form based on the operations described.

Output: **start_year (where start_year is the result of successively applying the operation (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for each element in the list nums, starting from the first element and moving towards the last one)**
