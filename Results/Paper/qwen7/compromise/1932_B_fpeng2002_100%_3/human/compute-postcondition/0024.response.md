Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `x` as the variable iterating over the range from 0 to `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is currently 1.
   - `start_year` is calculated as `((start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `x` for the next iteration**: Since `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1. For the next iteration, `x` will be 2.

5. **Determine the new value of `start_year`**: The value of `start_year` does not change within the loop itself; it is only set once before the loop starts based on the initial value of `start_year` and `nums[1]`. Therefore, the value of `start_year` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Formulate the new state**: The only variable that changes within the loop head is `x`, and `start_year` remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 2, `start_year` is ((start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])**
