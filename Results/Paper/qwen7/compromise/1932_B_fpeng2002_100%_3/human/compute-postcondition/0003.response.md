Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer - 1, and 0 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 999, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The value of `num_tests` remains unchanged as it was already an input integer - 1 and the condition 0 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 999 is still valid.
