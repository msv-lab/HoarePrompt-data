Based on the initial state described, the `start_year` is transformed according to the formula \((\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[x] + 1) * \text{nums}[x]\) for each index \(x\) from 0 to \(len(nums) - 1\). This transformation is applied sequentially for each element in the `nums` list.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Value**: Let's assume the initial value of `start_year` is \(S_0\).
2. **First Iteration**: For the first element `nums[0]`, the new value of `start_year` becomes \((S_0 // \text{nums}[0] + 1) * \text{nums}[0]\). Let's call this new value \(S_1\).
3. **Second Iteration**: For the second element `nums[1]`, the new value of `start_year` becomes \((S_1 // \text{nums}[1] + 1) * \text{nums}[1]\). Let's call this new value \(S_2\).
4. **Continuing the Process**: This process continues until all elements in `nums` have been processed. The final value of `start_year` after all iterations will be the result of applying the given operation to each element in `nums` in sequence.

Given the nature of the operation, the final value of `start_year` will be the result of a series of multiplications and additions based on the values in `nums`.

Since the exact values of `start_year` and `nums` are not provided, we can only describe the final value in terms of the operations performed.

Output: **the final value of start_year after applying the operation \((\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[x] + 1) * \text{nums}[x]\) for each index \(x\) from 0 to \(len(nums) - 1\)**
