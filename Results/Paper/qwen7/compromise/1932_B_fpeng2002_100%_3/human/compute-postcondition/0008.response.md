Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`
- `x` is 0

### Loop Statement
```
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `x`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.
3. **Current Value of `x`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0.
4. **Next Value of `x`**: For the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by 1, so `x` will become 1.
5. **Check if Loop Can Execute Again**: Since `x` is currently 0 and the loop runs from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`, the loop can still execute once more because `x` will be 1 in the next iteration.

### Adjusting the State
- The value of `start_year` remains unchanged because it is dependent on the value of `nums[x]` which is yet to be updated in this new iteration.
- The value of `x` will be updated to 1.

### Updated State
- `start_year` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `x` is now 1.

### Final Answer
State: **`start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `x` is 1**
