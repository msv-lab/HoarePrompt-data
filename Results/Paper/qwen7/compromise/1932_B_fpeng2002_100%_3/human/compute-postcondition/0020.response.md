Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `x`: This is the loop variable.
   - `len(nums)`: This is the upper bound of the range function.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be at least 1 because the range function will generate numbers from 0 up to but not including `len(nums)`.
   - The initial value of `x` is 0, and it will iterate as long as `x < len(nums)`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `num_tests` is `num_tests - 2`, which doesn't affect the loop execution directly.
   - `n` is an input integer, which also doesn't affect the loop execution directly.
   - `start_year` is 0, which doesn't affect the loop execution directly.
   - `nums` is a list of integers, and its length (`len(nums)`) must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are related to `x` and `len(nums)`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`x` is 0, `len(nums)` must be greater than 0**
