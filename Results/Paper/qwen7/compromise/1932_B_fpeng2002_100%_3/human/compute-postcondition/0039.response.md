Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `x`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**: Since `x` starts at 1, the next value it can take is 2 (as the loop increments `x` by 1 each iteration).

5. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be 2. The value of `start_year` does not change within the loop and remains as calculated from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`start_year` is \((\text{start_year} // \text{nums}[1] + 1) * \text{nums}[1]\), `x` is 2**
