Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums))`. The objects involved here are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` is the loop variable, which will take values from the range defined by `range(0, len(nums))`.
   - `nums` is the list whose length determines the number of iterations.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `x` is within the range `0` to `len(nums) - 1`.

4. **Initial state before the loop**:
   - `x` is an input list split from a string (which is not relevant for the loop).
   - `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1` (not directly related to the loop).
   - `n` is an input integer (not directly related to the loop).
   - `start_year` is 0 (not directly related to the loop).

5. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `nums` must be a non-empty list because the range function requires a valid list to determine its length.
   - The value of `x` in the first iteration will be `0`, so we need to ensure that `x` (the loop variable) starts at `0`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `nums` must be a non-empty list, and `x` must start at `0`.

**Final State**:
State: **`nums` must be a non-empty list, `x` is 0**
