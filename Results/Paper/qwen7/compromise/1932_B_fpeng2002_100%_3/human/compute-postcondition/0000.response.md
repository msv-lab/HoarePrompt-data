Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which is now `num_tests`) is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, the same condition applies to `num_tests`. The other conditions and constraints for `n` and `a_i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
