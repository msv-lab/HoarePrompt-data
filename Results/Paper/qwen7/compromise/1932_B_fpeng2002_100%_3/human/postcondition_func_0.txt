The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then calculates a value `start_year` by iteratively applying the operation \((\text{start_year} // \text{a}[x] + 1) * \text{a}[x]\) for each element in the list. Finally, it prints the calculated `start_year` for each test case.
