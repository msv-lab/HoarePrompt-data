Output State: **The output state will consist of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' printed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration from 0 to a-1. The specific sequence of outputs depends on the values of b and c entered during each iteration.**

This means that for each value of `i` from 0 to `a-1`, the program reads two integers `b` and `c` from input, checks the conditions, and prints either 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No'. The exact sequence of these outputs will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration.
