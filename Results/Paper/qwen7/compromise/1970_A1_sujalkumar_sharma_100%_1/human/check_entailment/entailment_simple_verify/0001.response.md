### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads a balanced parentheses sequence from the standard input and strips any leading/trailing whitespace.
   - It initializes the necessary variables (`n`, `prefix_balance`, and `balance`).

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and calculates the prefix balance for each character.
   - It appends a tuple containing the current balance, the index, and the character to the `prefix_balance` list.
   - The balance is incremented for an opening parenthesis `(` and decremented for a closing parenthesis `)`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The `prefix_balance` list is sorted based on the prefix balance in ascending order.
   - In case of a tie in prefix balance, the list is further sorted based on the position in descending order.
   - This ensures that the sequence is sorted as required by the problem statement.

4. **Result Construction**:
   - The program constructs the result sequence by concatenating the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list.
   - The third element of each tuple in the sorted list is used, which corresponds to the character at that position.

5. **Output**:
   - The constructed result sequence is returned and printed.

Given the steps and the implementation, the program correctly follows the logic described in the problem statement. Each step aligns with the requirements and the annotations provided.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given annotations.
