#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.

    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))

    #State: Output State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: the current balance, the index `i`, and the character at index `i` of `s`; `balance` is 0.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns the string `result` which is obtained by joining the third element of each tuple in the sorted `prefix_balance` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" and returns a new string `result`. This new string is formed by concatenating the characters from `s` based on their balance and index positions, after sorting the characters according to their balance and index in ascending order.
