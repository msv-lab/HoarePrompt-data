Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the remainder of a number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure the result fits within the required modulo constraint.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is supposed to find the segment with the maximum sum in the array. However, the provided implementation has a significant flaw. It always returns the last index of the array, regardless of the actual segment with the maximum sum. This means that the logic for finding the maximum segment sum is incorrect, leading to an incorrect solution for the main problem.

3. **Main Logic**: The main logic relies on `func_2` to find the maximum segment sum and then uses this to calculate the final answer. Since `func_2` always returns the last index of the array, it will incorrectly assume that the maximum segment sum is zero (if the array is non-empty) or the entire sum of the array (if the array is empty), which is not necessarily true.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because the core functionality of finding the maximum segment sum is flawed. Therefore, the overall solution will not provide the correct maximum possible sum of the array after k operations.

Correctness: **False**
