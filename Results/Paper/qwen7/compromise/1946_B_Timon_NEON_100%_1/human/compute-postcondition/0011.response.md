Output State: `segments_variants` is now ['new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]'], `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [len(arr) - 1]

Explanation: The loop iterates over `segments_variants`, which contains a single element 'new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]'. Inside the loop, it checks if `total_max_segment[0]` is less than `segment[0]` and if the length of `segment` is not 1. Since `total_max_segment` starts as [-1] and `segment[0]` (which is `new_segment + [len(arr) - 1][0]`) will always be greater than -1 (assuming `len(arr) > 0`), the condition `total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]` will always be true. Therefore, `total_max_segment` gets updated to `segment`, resulting in `total_max_segment` being set to `[len(arr) - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
