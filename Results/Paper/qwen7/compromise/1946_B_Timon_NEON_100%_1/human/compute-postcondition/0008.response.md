Output State: **`segments_variants` is now ['new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]'], `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `segments_variants` list. This new element is the concatenation of `new_segment` (which is an empty list) and `[len(arr) - 1]`. Since `new_segment` is an empty list, the new element added to `segments_variants` is simply `[len(arr) - 1]`. The other variables (`max_segment` and `max_sum`) remain unchanged.
