Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` groups of inputs. Each group includes a positive integer `n` and an array `a` containing `n` integers. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**

- For each test case, the function processes a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and an array `a` of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
- The function returns different results based on the processed inputs, but the specific logic for returning these results is not detailed in the given information.
