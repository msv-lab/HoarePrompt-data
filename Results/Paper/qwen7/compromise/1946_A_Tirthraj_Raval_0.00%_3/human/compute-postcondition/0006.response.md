Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It then sorts the array and calculates the count of the middle element (if `n` is odd) or the lower of the two middle elements (if `n` is even). The function outputs this count for each test case.**
