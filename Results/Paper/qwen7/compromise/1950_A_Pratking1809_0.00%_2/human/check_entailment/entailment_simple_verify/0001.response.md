### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `mn` is initialized to 100, but it is not used in the logic, which is fine since it's not required for the problem.
3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The loop iterates `q` times, processing each test case.
4. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
5. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.

However, there is a logical issue with the order of the conditions in the program. Specifically, the conditions are checked in the following order:
- `a < b < c` (for 'STAIR')
- `a < b > c` (for 'PEAK')

This means that if both conditions are false, the program will print 'NONE'. However, the correct logic should be to check both conditions separately and print the appropriate result based on which condition is true. The current implementation will incorrectly print 'NONE' if both conditions are false, even if one of them should be true.

To illustrate this, consider the test case `1 5 3`:
- `a < b < c` is false (`1 < 5 < 3` is false).
- `a < b > c` is true (`1 < 5 > 3` is true).

In the current implementation, the program will print 'NONE' because the second condition is checked after the first one fails. This is incorrect.

### Corrected Implementation:
The conditions should be checked separately and the appropriate result should be printed based on which condition is true. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly identify whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate due to the logical error in the order of condition checking. The program needs to be corrected as shown above.

### Final:
Final: **False**
