Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical issue with how it processes the test cases. The variables `mn` and the subsequent logic for finding the minimum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` are unnecessary and incorrectly implemented. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for _ in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This corrected version directly checks the conditions for a stair and a peak without any unnecessary variables or logic.
