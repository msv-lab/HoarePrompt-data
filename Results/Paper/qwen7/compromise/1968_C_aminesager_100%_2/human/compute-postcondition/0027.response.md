Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` contains an element equal to `a[0] + T[0]` and `a` has an additional element equal to `a[1] + T[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`. The new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression simplifies to `a[1] + T[1]`. Therefore, the updated list `a` now includes the original element `a[0] + T[0]` and the new element `a[1] + T[1]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
