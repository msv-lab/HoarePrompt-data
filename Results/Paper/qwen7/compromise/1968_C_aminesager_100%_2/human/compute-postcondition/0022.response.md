Output State: **`t` is a truthy value - 1, `n` is an input integer, `line` is an input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in `line.split()` to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` takes the string `line`, splits it into a list of substrings based on spaces, and then converts each substring to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `T`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `line` remain unchanged from their initial states.
