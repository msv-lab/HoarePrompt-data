Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list starting with the integer 1000, followed by `n-1` elements where each element is calculated as the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element from the list `T` (excluding the first element of `T`). The value of `n` is greater than 1, and `i` equals `n`. `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list with `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is equal to the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `T` plus `a[0] + T[0]`, and `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: The list `a` remains unchanged, `i` is `n`, `n` is the input integer, the string `result` is a space-separated string of elements from list `a`, the variable `t` is still truthy, and the variable `line` remains as the original input entered by the user.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
