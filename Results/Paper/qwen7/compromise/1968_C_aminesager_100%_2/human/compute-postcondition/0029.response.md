Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` has three elements where `a[0]` is equal to `a[0] + T[0]`, `a[1]` is equal to `a[1] + T[1]`, and `a[2]` is equal to `a[1] + T[1] + a[0] + T[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[2]`, and `T[i - 1]` refers to `T[2]`. Since `a` initially had two elements (`a[0] + T[0]` and `a[1] + T[1]`), appending `a[2] + T[2]` means the third element of `a` is now `a[1] + T[1] + a[0] + T[0]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
