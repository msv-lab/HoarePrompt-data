Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`, which is presumably a boolean or a non-empty collection that controls the loop execution.

2. **Determine the relevant states**: The relevant states for the loop head are `t` and possibly `i` and `n` since they might affect the loop condition or the loop body. However, based on the given information, only `t` is explicitly mentioned in the loop condition.

3. **Analyze the current state**: 
   - `a` is a list starting with the integer 1000, followed by `n-1` elements where each element is calculated as the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element from the list `T` (excluding the first element of `T`).
   - The value of `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` equals `n`.
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `t` must be true. Since no specific value or condition for `t` is given directly, we assume that `t` needs to be set to a truthy value (e.g., `True` or a non-empty collection) to allow the loop to continue.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a truthy value**
