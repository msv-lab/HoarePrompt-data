Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a` contains an element equal to `a[0] + T[0]` and `a` has an additional element equal to `a[1] + T[1]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3 (since the loop starts from 1).
   - `n` must still be greater than 1, but it doesn't change based on the loop itself; it remains as it was before.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - The contents of `a` do not change based on the loop head variables `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` contains an element equal to `a[0] + T[0]` and `a` has an additional element equal to `a[1] + T[1]`**
