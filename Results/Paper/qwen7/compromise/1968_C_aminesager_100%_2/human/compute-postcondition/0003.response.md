Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially described as a positive integer within the specified range, and the variable `x` is not affected by the given code.
