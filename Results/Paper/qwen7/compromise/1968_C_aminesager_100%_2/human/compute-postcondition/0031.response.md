Output State: `i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list with `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is equal to the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `T` plus `a[0] + T[0]`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`. The list `a` will contain `n` elements, starting with `a[0]` being equal to `a[0] + T[0]`, and each subsequent element `a[j]` will be the sum of `a[j-1] + T[j-1]` for all `j` from 1 to `n-1`.
