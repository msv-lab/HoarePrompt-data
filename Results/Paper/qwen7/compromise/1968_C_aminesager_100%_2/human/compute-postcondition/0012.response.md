Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` now contains the new element `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Understand what happens in the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration (`i = i + 1`), in the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be within the range `1` to `n-1` (since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` will contain the new element based on the updated `i` value.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `i + 1` from the previous value.
- `a` will contain the new element based on the updated `i` value, which is `a[i] = a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` where `i` is now `i + 1`.

So, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` now contains the new element `a[i] + T[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1**
