Output State: **The list `a` contains `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is equal to the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `T` plus `a[0] + T[0]`. The variable `t` is 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `result` is a space-separated string containing the elements of `a`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will contain `n` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the first `j+1` elements of `T` starting from `a[0] + T[0]`. The loop runs until `t` becomes 0, meaning it has processed all inputs. The `result` variable will hold the final state of `a` as a space-separated string.
