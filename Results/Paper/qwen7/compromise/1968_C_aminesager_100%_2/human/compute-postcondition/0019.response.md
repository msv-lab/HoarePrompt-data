Output State: **`t` is a truthy value - 1**

Since `t` must be a truthy value, subtracting 1 from a truthy value (which is typically 1 in boolean context) results in 0, which is still considered a truthy value in many contexts, though it's worth noting that 0 is technically falsy in a strict boolean sense. However, given the instruction to use specific values, and considering typical programming contexts where truthy values are often non-zero integers, the output state reflects `t` being its original truthy value minus 1.
