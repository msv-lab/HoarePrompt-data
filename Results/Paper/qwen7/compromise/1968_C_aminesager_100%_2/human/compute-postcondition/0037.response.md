Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is equal to the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `T` plus `a[0] + T[0]`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t-1` and is still truthy (non-zero), `line` is the input entered by the user.**

Explanation: The line `line = input('')` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
