Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a` contains an element equal to `a[0] + T[0]`

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to continue, `i` should be incremented to 2.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.
   - The condition `n > 1` remains the same as it was not modified in the loop body.
   - The variable `a` does not depend on the loop head variables and hence its state remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` contains an element equal to `a[0] + T[0]`**
