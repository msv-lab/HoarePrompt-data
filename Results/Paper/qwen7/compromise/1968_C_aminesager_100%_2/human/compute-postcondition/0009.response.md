Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so the loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `a` has a new element which is `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, and `n` must be greater than 1.
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `i` by 1 each time, if `i` was previously `k`, it will now be `k + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same unless specified otherwise within the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- The previous value of `i` was `k` (where `k` is some integer such that `1 <= k < n`).
- After the loop increment, `i` becomes `k + 1`.
- `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`a` has a new element which is `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1**.

To provide a concrete example, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration:

State: **`a` has a new element which is `a[1] + T[1]`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**.

In general form, the answer is:

State: **`a` has a new element which is `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1**.
