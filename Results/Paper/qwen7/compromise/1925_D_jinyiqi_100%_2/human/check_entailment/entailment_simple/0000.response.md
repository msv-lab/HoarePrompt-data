Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` as specified. This part is correct.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of all `f` values (`sum_f`) for each test case. This is also correct as per the problem statement.

3. **Combination Calculation**: The variable `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which represents the total number of unique pairs of children. This is correct.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate `p` and `q` is derived from the problem's requirements. Specifically, `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` and `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2`. These formulas are correct based on the problem's explanation.
   - The GCD operation to simplify `p` and `q` is also correct.
   - The final output is computed using the modular multiplicative inverse, which is necessary because we need the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Modular Arithmetic**: The use of `pow(q, -1, M)` to find the modular inverse is correct, ensuring the final result is within the required modulus.

Given the above points, the program logic aligns with the problem description and the provided example. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the code.

Correctness: **True**
