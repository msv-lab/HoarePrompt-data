Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user, `sum_f` is `f`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `f` is the third integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Since `f` is the third integer entered by the user, `sum_f` now holds the value of `f`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
