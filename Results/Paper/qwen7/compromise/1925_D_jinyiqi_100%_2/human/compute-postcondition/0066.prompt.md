Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer value input by the user, and M is 1000000007.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    sum_f = 0
    for j in range(m):
        a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
        sum_f += f
    cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
    p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
    q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
    gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
    p = p // gcd
    q = q // gcd
    print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered for each iteration, `b` is the second integer entered for each iteration, `f` is the third integer entered for each iteration, `j` is the last value it took during the loop execution, which is `m-1`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`, `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2`, `q` is now `q // gcd`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered for each iteration, `b` is the second integer entered for each iteration, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`, `f` is the third integer entered for each iteration, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `-1`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f` plus (m-1) times the latest input value of `f`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `f` is the last input integer, `p` is `k * (2 * cn2 * sum_f + m * (k - 1))`, `q` is `2 * cn2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `p` is `p // gcd`, `q` is `q // gcd`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
