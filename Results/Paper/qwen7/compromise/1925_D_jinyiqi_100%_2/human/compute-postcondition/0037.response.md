Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` will be equal to `m-1`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` will be the first integer entered for each iteration, `b` will be the second integer entered for each iteration, `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`, and `f` will be the third integer entered for each iteration.**

Explanation: The code calculates `cn2` as `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This calculation does not affect the values of `j`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `sum_f`, or `f`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions post-execution.
