Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user.
   - `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`.
   - `m` must be at least 1.
   - `a` is the first integer entered for each iteration.
   - `b` is the second integer entered for each iteration.
   - `f` is the third integer entered for each iteration.
   - `j` is the last value it took during the loop execution, which is `m-1`.
   - `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`.
   - `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2`.
   - `q` is now `q // gcd`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, after the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `t` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user; `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`; `m` must be at least 1; `a` is the first integer entered for each iteration; `b` is the second integer entered for each iteration; `f` is the third integer entered for each iteration; `j` is the last value it took during the loop execution, which is `m-1`; `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`; `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`; `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2`; `q` is now `q // gcd`**
