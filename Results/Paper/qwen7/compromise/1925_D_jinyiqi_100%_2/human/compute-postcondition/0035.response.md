Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `m - 1`, meaning it will take on the value of the last integer in the range `range(m)`. The variable `sum_f` will hold the cumulative sum of all `f` values entered over the entire range of `m`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` from each iteration will no longer be relevant since they are used within the loop and then discarded. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `gcd`, `t`, `p`, `q`, `cn2`, and `i` will retain their final values determined by the loop's initial conditions and the calculations performed inside the loop.
