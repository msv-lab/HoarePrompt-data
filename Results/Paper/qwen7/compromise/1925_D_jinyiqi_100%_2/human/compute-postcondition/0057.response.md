Output State: `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `-1`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f` plus (m-1) times the latest input value of `f`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `f` is the last input integer.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cn2` remains unchanged as it was initially set and does not get modified within the loop. The variable `j` will be decremented to `-1` after the loop finishes since it starts at `m-1` and gets decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`. The `sum_f` will accumulate the sum of all `f` values provided as input, with each `f` value added once per its corresponding iteration, totaling `m` times. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the first two `f` inputs, and `f` will hold the value of the last `f` input provided.
