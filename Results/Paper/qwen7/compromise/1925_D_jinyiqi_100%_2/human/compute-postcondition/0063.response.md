Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `-1`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f` plus (m-1) times the latest input value of `f`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `f` is the last input integer, `p` is `k * (2 * cn2 * sum_f + m * (k - 1))`, `q` is `2 * cn2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `p` is `p // gcd`, `q` is `q // gcd`**

Explanation: The code `q = q // gcd` divides the value of `q` by the greatest common divisor (`gcd`) of `p` and `q`. This operation updates the value of `q` to its simplified form. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
