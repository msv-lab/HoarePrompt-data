Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `-1`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f` plus (m-1) times the latest input value of `f`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `f` is the last input integer, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * cn2 ** 2`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `q` the value `2 * cn2 ** 2`. Since `cn2` is already defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `q` is now `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
