Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `-1`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f` plus (m-1) times the latest input value of `f`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `f` is the last input integer, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`**.

This output state reflects that the variable `p` has been calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, while all other variables retain their initial values from the precondition.
