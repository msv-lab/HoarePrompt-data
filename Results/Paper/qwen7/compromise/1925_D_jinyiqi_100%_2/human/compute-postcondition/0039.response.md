Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered for each iteration, `b` is the second integer entered for each iteration, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`, `f` is the third integer entered for each iteration, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `q` is `2 * cn2 ** 2`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value `2 * cn2 ** 2` to the variable `q`. Since `cn2` is defined as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `q` is calculated as `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2) ** 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
