Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `f` is the third integer entered, `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `sum_f += f` updates the value of `sum_f` by adding the value of `f` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
