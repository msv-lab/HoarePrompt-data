Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `-1`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f` plus (m-1) times the latest input value of `f`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `f` is the last input integer, `p` is `k * (2 * cn2 * sum_f + m * (k - 1))`, `q` is `2 * cn2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, `p` is `p // gcd`**

Explanation: The code divides `p` by `gcd(p, q)`. Since `p` was initially `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` and `q` was `2 * cn2`, `p` is now simplified to `k * (2 * cn2 * sum_f + m * (k - 1))` divided by their greatest common divisor `gcd`. The other variables remain unchanged.
