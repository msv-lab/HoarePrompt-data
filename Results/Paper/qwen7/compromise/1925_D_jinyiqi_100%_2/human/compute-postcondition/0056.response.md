Output State: `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `0`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f` plus `(m-1)` times the latest input value of `f`, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `f` is the last input integer.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will be 0 because it decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `sum_f` will be the cumulative sum of all `f` values entered as inputs, with each `f` value added `m` times (once for each iteration of the loop). The variables `a`, `b`, and `f` will hold the values of the last set of integers entered as input during the loop's final iteration.
