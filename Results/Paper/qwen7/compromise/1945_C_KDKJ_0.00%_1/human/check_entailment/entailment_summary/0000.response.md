Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the optimal position to place a road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied.
2. Function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem for a single test case. It iterates through the string `a` and calculates the number of '0's (left side preference) and '1's (right side preference) up to each position. It then checks if placing the road at each position satisfies the condition.
3. Function `func_2` is a wrapper function that processes multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases, processes each one by calling `func_1`, and prints the result.
4. The provided execution summary for `func_1` correctly describes its behavior and logic, which aligns with the problem statement.
5. The provided execution summary for `func_2` correctly indicates that it calls `func_1` for each test case, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given that both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and handle multiple test cases, the overall program meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
