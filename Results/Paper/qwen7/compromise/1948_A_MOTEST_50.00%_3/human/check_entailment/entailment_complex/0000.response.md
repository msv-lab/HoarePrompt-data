Reasoning:
- The function correctly handles the input constraints for `t` and `n`.
- For each test case, the function checks if `n` is 1. If so, it prints "NO" as required.
- For other values of `n`, the function constructs a string `ans` that meets the criteria of having exactly `n` special characters.
- The construction logic is as follows:
  - If `n` is even, it creates a string with pairs of distinct characters from the uppercase alphabet until it reaches `n // 2` characters.
  - If `n` is odd, it starts with "AAA" and then continues with pairs of distinct characters from the uppercase alphabet until it reaches `n // 2 - 1` characters.
- The constructed string `ans` will indeed have exactly `n` special characters because:
  - Each pair of distinct characters contributes exactly one special character (the second character of each pair).
  - For odd `n`, the initial "AAA" ensures that the first three characters are special, and the rest follow the same pattern.
- The function prints "YES" followed by the constructed string `ans` for each valid `n`.
- The function does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases beyond the specified constraints, but within those constraints, it works as intended.

Given the above reasoning, the function correctly implements the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
