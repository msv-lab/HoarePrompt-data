Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the command 'os.system("cls")' has been executed to clear the terminal.**

The code `os.system('cls')` is used to clear the terminal screen. However, since no variables are assigned or modified by this command, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The only effect is the clearing of the terminal screen.
