Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (since `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to t-1).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will be 0 initially, but this does not need to be explicitly stated since it is part of the loop's initialization.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
