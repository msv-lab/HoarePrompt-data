Output State: **`i` is 1 more than its previous value, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code `ans = ''` initializes the variable `ans` to an empty string. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
