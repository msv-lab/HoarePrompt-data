Output State: **`i` is 1 more than its previous value, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is now 4 + 2 * s[3], `x` is 3, `j` is `n // 2 + 1`**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Given that `x` was initially 2, after executing this line, `x` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
