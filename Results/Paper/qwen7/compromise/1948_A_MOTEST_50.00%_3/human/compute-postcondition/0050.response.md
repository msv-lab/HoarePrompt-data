Output State: **`i` is 1 more than its previous value, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is now 4 (0 + 2 * s[1]), `x` is 1, `j` is `n // 2`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `s[x] * 2` to its current value. Given that `x` is 1 and `ans` was initially 0 plus 2 times `s[x]`, which means `ans` was 2 * `s[1]`, the new value of `ans` is 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
