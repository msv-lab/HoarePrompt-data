Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n // 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `ans` is `s[x-1] * 2`
   - `n` must be at least 2

4. **Determine the new value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 2.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n // 2`.
   - Given that `j` is now 2, the loop will continue if `n // 2 > 2`, which means `n > 4`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `ans` stays as `s[x-1] * 2`.
   - `n` must still be at least 2, but to ensure the loop continues, `n` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`j` is 2, `ans` is `s[x-1] * 2`, `n` must be greater than 4**
