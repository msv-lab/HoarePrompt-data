Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `range(n // 2 - 1)`, meaning `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `n // 2 - 2`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
   - `ans` is 'AAABBB'
   - `x` is 2
   - `i` is 3
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `j` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n // 2 - 1`. Since `j` is currently 0, it is indeed less than `n // 2 - 1` (assuming `n` is at least 4).

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to update the state such that `j` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `j` will be 1.

5. **Keep other states unchanged**: The values of `ans`, `x`, `i`, `t`, and `n` remain the same unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not provided here.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ans` is 'AAABBB', `x` is 2, `i` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 1**
