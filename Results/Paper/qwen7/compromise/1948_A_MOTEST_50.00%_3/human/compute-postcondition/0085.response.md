Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n // 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0
   - `ans` is `s[x-1] * 2`
   - `x` is 1

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < n // 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration), so `j` will become 1.
   - Therefore, `j` must be 1 for the loop to execute again.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop body based on the given information, so it remains the same.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` needs to be adjusted to 1.
   - `ans` and `x` are not part of the loop head and their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `ans` is `s[x-1] * 2`, `x` is 1**
