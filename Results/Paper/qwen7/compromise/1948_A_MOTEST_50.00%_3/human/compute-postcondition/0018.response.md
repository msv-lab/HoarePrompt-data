Output State: **`j` is 3, `ans` is `ans` + 2 * `s[x]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding twice the value of `s[x]` to it. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `s[x]` or `ans`, the updated value of `ans` is expressed as `ans` + 2 * `s[x]`. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 3.
