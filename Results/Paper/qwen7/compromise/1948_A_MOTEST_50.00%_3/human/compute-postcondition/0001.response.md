Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `s` is a string containing all uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z'**.

The code initializes a string `s` with all uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z'. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
