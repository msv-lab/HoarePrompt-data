Output State: **`j` is 2, `ans` is `s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2`, `x` is 2, `ans` is increased by `s[2] * 2`**

Explanation: The initial value of `ans` is `s[1-1] * 2 + s[1] * 2`, which simplifies to `s[0] * 2 + s[1] * 2`. After executing the line `ans += s[x] * 2`, `ans` is increased by `s[2] * 2`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `s[0] * 2 + s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
