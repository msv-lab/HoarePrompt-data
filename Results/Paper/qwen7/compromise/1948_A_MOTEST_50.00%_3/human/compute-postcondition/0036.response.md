Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is a string containing either the concatenated result of `s[x-1] * 2` for each iteration where `j` is equal to `n // 2`, or a string of 'A' repeated `n // 2 - 1` times followed by `n // 2 - 1` times the character at index `x` of `s`, and `x` is equal to `n // 2` or `n // 2 + 1` depending on whether the condition `n % 2 == 0` is true or false.**
