Output State: **`j` is 1, `ans` is `s[x-1] * 2`, `n` must be at least 2**

Explanation: The variable `x` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables (`j`, `ans`, and the condition on `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `j` is now 1 (since `x` was incremented), `ans` remains as `s[x-1] * 2` (with `x` now being 1, so `x-1` is 0), and `n` must still be at least 2.
