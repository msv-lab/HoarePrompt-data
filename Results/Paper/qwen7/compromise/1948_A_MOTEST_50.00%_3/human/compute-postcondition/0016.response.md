Output State: **`j` is 2, `ans` is `s[x-1] * 2 + s[x] * 2`, `x` is increased by 1**.

The value of `j` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `ans` stays as `s[x-1] * 2 + s[x] * 2`. The value of `x` is incremented by 1, but the exact new value of `x` is not specified in the initial state. The condition that `n` must be greater than 4 is still valid.
