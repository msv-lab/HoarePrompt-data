Output State: **`i` is 1 more than its previous value, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0 plus 2 times `s[x]`, `x` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by `2 * s[0]`. Since the value of `x` is 0, `ans` is updated to `0 + 2 * s[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
