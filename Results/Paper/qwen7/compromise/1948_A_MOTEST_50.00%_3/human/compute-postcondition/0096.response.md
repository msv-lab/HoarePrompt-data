Output State: **`ans` is 'AAABBB', `x` is 1, `i` is 2 more than its initial value, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, and `j` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends twice the character at index `x` in the string `s` to `ans`. Given the initial state, `ans` starts as 'AAA', and `x` is 1. The character at index 1 in `s` (assuming `s` is the default string 'ABC') is 'B'. Therefore, `ans` becomes 'AAABBB'. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
