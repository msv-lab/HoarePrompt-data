Output State: **`c` is the sum of the elements in `l` starting from the second element, `l` is the list without the first element**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by the value of `x`, which is the next element in the list `l`. After this operation, `c` holds the cumulative sum of the elements starting from the second element of the list `l`, while `l` remains unchanged except for the fact that its first element has been removed.
