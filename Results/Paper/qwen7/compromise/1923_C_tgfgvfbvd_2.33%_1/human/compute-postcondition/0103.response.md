Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop variable is an underscore `_` (which is typically used when the variable is not needed), and the loop runs for a number of times equal to the integer input from the user.

2. **Understand the Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration provides us with several pieces of information:
   - `m` will be 0.
   - `a` will be `input_integer - number_of_iterations`.
   - `b` will be `input_integer - number_of_iterations`.
   - `c` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`.
   - `s` will be `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
   - The list `p` will contain all cumulative sums of the elements in `l` as they were appended in each iteration of the loop.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration State**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state based on the loop's behavior:
   - The number of iterations increases by 1.
   - Since the loop variable is an underscore, it does not directly affect the state of `a`, `b`, `c`, or `s`.
   - However, the list `p` will grow by one element, representing the cumulative sum of the elements up to the current iteration.
   - The value of `input_integer` remains the same, but `number_of_iterations` increases by 1.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `m` will still be 0.
- `a` will now be `input_integer - (number_of_iterations + 1)`.
- `b` will now be `input_integer - (number_of_iterations + 1)`.
- `c` will remain the same as it is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, which does not change until a new element is added.
- `s` will be updated based on the new values of `a` and `b` after the next iteration.
- The list `p` will have one additional element, representing the cumulative sum up to the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`m` is 0, `a` is `input_integer - (number_of_iterations + 1)`, `b` is `input_integer - (number_of_iterations + 1)`, `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`, and the list `p` will contain all cumulative sums of the elements in `l` up to the next iteration.**
