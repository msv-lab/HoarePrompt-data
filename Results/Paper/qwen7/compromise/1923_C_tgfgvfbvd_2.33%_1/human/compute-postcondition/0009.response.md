Output State: **`c` is increased by `x`, `l` must not be empty (still containing at least one element), `p` is equal to the new value of `c`**.

This means that the value of `c` has been increased by `x`, and `p` now holds the updated value of `c`. The condition that `l` must not be empty is still valid.
