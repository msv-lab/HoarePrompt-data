Postcondition: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `2 * p[a - 2]`**.

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts, indicating that regardless of the condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `s` do not change from their initial states as described in the precondition.
