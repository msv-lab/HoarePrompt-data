Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer and decreased by the number of iterations, `b` is an input integer, `c` is increased by `x`, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `m * p[a - 2]`, `n` is an input integer, the list `l` must have at least one element, and the list `p` is now an empty list.**

In this scenario, the code `c += x` increases the value of `c` by the value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
