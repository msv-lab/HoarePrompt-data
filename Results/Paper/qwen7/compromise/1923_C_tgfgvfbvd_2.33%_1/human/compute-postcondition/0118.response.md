Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(m)`. The only variable involved here is `m`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know that `l` is an empty list, `c` is the sum of all elements in the original list `l`, and `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `m` is greater than 0. If `m` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop head involves `m`, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The initial values of `l`, `c`, and `p` do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to be greater than 0.

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
