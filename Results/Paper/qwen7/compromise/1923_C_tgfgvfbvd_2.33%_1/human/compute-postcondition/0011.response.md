Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in l:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `l`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is increased by `x`.
   - `l` must not be empty (still containing at least one element).
   - `p` is equal to the new value of `c`.
   - `p` is now a list containing the value of `c`.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the variable being iterated over from the list `l`, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the list `l`.
   - `l` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `c` was increased by `x` in the previous iteration, but for the next iteration, we don't know the exact value of `x` yet. However, we know `l` must still contain at least one element.
   - `p` is updated to the new value of `c` at the start of each iteration, so it will be updated again once the loop starts the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `l` must still contain at least one element and `x` will be the next element in the list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`c` is increased by the next element in `l`, `l` must contain at least one element, `p` is equal to the new value of `c`, `p` is now a list containing the value of `c`**.

To be more specific in the format requested:
State: **`c` is increased by the next element in `l`, `l` must contain at least one element, `p` is equal to the new value of `c`, `p` is now a list containing the value of `c`**.
