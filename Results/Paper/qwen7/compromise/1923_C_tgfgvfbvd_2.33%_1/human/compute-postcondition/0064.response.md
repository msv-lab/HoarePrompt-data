Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer and decreased by the number of iterations, `b` is an input integer, `c` is increased by `x` and now stored in the list `p`, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `m * p[a - 2]`, `n` is an input integer, the list `p` now contains an additional element `c + x`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(c)` adds the value of `c` (which is `c + x`) to the list `p`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
