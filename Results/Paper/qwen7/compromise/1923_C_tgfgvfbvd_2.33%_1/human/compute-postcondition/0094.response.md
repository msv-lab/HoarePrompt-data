Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `m`, `s`, and `p` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `m` must still be greater than 1, `a` and `b` are now set to the input integers, and `s` remains as the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
