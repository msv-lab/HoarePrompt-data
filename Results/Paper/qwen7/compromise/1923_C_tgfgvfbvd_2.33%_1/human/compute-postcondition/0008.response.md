Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in l:`. The variables involved here are `x` and `l`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is increased by `x`, `l` must not be empty, and `p` contains the value of `c`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must not be empty. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `l`.

4. **Adjust the states**: Since `l` must not be empty for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `l` still contains at least one element. The variable `c` and `p` do not directly affect the loop condition and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`c` is increased by `x`, `l` must not be empty (still containing at least one element), `p` contains the value of `c`**
