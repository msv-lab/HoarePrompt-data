Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p`.
- If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0, then `s` is decreased by `p[a - 2]`.
- Additionally, `s` is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray defined by indices `a-1` to `b-1`, and the length of this subarray is greater than 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
