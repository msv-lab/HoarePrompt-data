Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p`. If `a - 2` is greater than or equal to 0 and `s` is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray defined by indices `a-1` to `b-1` and the length of this subarray is greater than 1, then `s` is decreased by `p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.
