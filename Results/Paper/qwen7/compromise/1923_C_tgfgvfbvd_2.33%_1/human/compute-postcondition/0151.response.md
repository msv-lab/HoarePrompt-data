Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `s`, or any other variables. Since the task does not require us to determine the values of `a` and `b` or any changes to `p`, we can directly state what will be printed.

Output: **'NO'**
