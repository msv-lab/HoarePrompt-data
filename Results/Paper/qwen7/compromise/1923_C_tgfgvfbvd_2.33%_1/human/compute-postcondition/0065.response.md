Output State: `m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer and decreased by the number of iterations, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of all elements in list `l`, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `m * p[a - 2]`, `n` is an input integer, the list `l` must be non-empty, and the list `p` now contains all the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `m` remains unchanged, `a` is reduced by the number of iterations, `b` remains unchanged, `c` will hold the total sum of all elements in the list `l`, `s` will be calculated based on the last value of `c` and the second-to-last value of `p`, `n` remains unchanged, the list `l` must contain at least one element, and the list `p` will contain all the cumulative sums of the elements in `l` as it goes through each iteration.
