Output State: **`m` is an integer input from the user split by space, `l` is a list of integers converted from the input split by space, `p` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `p`. This does not affect the values of `m` or `l`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `m` and `l`, while adding that `p` is now an empty list.
