Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer and has been decreased by 1.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus the element at index `a - 2` of the list `p`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to 1.
- Either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1 or `s` is less than `2 * (b - a + 1)`.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **'NO'**
