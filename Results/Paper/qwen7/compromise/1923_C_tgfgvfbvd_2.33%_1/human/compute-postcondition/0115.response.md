Output State: **`l` is the list without the first two elements; `c` is the sum of the elements in `l` starting from the second element plus `x`; `p` contains the value of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `c += x` increments the value of `c` by `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `c` now includes the sum of the elements in `l` starting from the second element plus `x`.
