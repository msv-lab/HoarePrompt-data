Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is the first input integer.
- `b` is the second input integer.
- `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p`.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is decreased by the element at index `a - 2` of the list `p`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `s`, and `p` do not affect this particular print statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Output: **YES**
