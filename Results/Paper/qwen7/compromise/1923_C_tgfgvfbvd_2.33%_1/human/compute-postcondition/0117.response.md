Output State: **`l` is an empty list; `c` is the sum of all elements in the original list `l`; `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `l` will be reduced to an empty list since an element is removed from `l` in each iteration. The variable `c` will hold the sum of all elements in the original list `l` because it accumulates the sum of the remaining elements in `l` in each iteration. The list `p` will contain all the cumulative sums of the elements in `l` as each element is processed, resulting in a list of sums where each element represents the sum of the sublist from the start of `l` up to the current element.
