Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `2 * p[a - 2]`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `s` do not affect this print statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Output: **NO**
