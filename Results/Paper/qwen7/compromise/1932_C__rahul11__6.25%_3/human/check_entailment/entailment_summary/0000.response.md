Reasoning:
1. The program initializes with a large MOD value (`10 ** 9 + 6`), which is unnecessary for the given problem constraints.
2. It correctly processes each test case by reading the necessary inputs: `n`, `m`, the array `arr`, and the string `s`.
3. The program initializes the result array `res` with zeros and calculates the initial product `ans` of all elements in `arr`.
4. It then iterates through the string `s` to process each command:
   - If the command is 'L', it divides the product by the leftmost element and updates the result array.
   - If the command is 'R', it divides the product by the rightmost element and updates the result array.
5. After processing each command, it correctly updates the product and the result array.
6. The program prints the result array for each test case.

Given the execution summary and the program's logic, the program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
