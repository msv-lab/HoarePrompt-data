Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0.**

The code initializes a new variable `l` and sets it to 0. This does not affect any of the existing variables (`arr`, `i`, `ans`, `res[0]`, `c`). Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `l`.
