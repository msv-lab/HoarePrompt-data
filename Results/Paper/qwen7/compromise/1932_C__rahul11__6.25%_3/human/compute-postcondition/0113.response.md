Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a non-empty list.
   - `i` is the first element of `arr`.
   - `ans` is the product of `ans` and the first element of `arr`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in arr:`.
   - This means `i` takes the value of each element in `arr` one by one.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since this is the start of the next iteration, `i` will now be the second element of `arr`.
   - `ans` will be updated to include the product of `ans` and the new value of `i`.

4. **Updated States:**
   - `arr` remains a non-empty list.
   - `i` will now be the second element of `arr`.
   - `ans` will be the product of `ans` and the second element of `arr`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `ans` is the product of `ans` and the second element of `arr`**
