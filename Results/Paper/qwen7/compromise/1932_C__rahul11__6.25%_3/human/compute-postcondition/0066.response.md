Output State: `arr` is a list of integers from the input, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`. For each iteration, the variable `ans` is updated by multiplying it with the current element `i`. After all iterations, `ans` will hold the product of all elements in the list `arr`. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `c`, `k`, `s`, `res`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
