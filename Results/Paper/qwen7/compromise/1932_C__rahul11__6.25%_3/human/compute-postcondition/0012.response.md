Output State: **`ans` is `i * i * i`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `m` is the second integer input split from the input string, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer except the first two elements, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `res` is a list of zeros with length `n`, `i` is the third element of `arr`**.

Explanation: The line `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by `i`. Since the initial value of `ans` was `i * i`, after executing this line, `ans` becomes `i * i * i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
