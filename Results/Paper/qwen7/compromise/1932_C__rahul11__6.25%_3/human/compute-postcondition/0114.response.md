Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `ans` is the product of `ans` and the second element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`, which is the second element of the list `arr`. Since the initial state specifies that `ans` is the product of `ans` and the second element of `arr`, after executing the code, `ans` will be updated to the new product. However, the exact numerical value of `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the initial value of `ans` and the second element of `arr`. The variables `arr` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
