Output State: **`ans` is the value of `ans` divided by `arr[r]` and then taken modulo `MOD`, `s` is a string, `k` is an index within the string `s`, the character at index `k` in string `s` is not 'L', `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
