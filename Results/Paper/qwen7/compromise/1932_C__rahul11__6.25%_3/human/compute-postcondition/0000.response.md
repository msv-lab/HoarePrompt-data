Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; the array `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all i; the string `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `MOD` is 1000000006.**

Explanation: The code initializes the constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 6`, which evaluates to `1000000006`. This value does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `s`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while updating the value of `MOD`.
