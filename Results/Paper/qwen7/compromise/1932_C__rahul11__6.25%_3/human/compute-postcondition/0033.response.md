Output State: **`ans` is equal to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ans % m % MOD` to `res[c]`. The values of `ans`, `c`, and `k` are updated as per the initial state. The value of `res[c]` is now set to the computed value based on `ans`, `m`, and `MOD`.
