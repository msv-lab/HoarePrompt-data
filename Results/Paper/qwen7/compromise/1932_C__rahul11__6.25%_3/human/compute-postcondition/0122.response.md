Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

The code `r = n - 1` assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `r`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
