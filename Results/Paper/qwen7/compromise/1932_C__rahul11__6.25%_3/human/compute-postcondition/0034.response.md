Output State: **`ans` is equal to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The values of `ans`, `c`, `k`, and `res[c]` remain unchanged from their previous states as no reassignment or calculation involving these variables is performed.
