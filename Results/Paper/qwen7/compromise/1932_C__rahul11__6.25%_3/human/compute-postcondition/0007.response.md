Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the elements of the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the variables involved in the loop**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the first integer input split from the input string.
   - `m` is the second integer input split from the input string.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string.
   - `res` is a list of zeros with length `n`.
   - `ans` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `arr`. Therefore, the only variable that changes within the loop is `i`, which takes on each value from `arr` in sequence.

4. **Adjust the states needed for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `i` is iterating over `arr`, the initial state of `i` should be the first element of `arr`.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `s`, `res`, `ans`) do not change within the loop and their values before the loop start are sufficient.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`, which should be the first element of `arr`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the first element of `arr`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `m` is the second integer input split from the input string, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input string, `res` is a list of zeros with length `n`, `ans` is 1**
