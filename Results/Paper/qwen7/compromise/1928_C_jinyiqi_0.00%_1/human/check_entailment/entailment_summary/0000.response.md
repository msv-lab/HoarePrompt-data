Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit the described settling pattern.

2. **Key Points from the Execution Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly returns the divisors of \( x \) in descending order, followed by the corresponding quotients in descending order.
   - The main logic involves checking if the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) can form valid \( k \) values.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code iterates over test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It checks if these divisors can form valid \( k \) values by ensuring they are even and greater than or equal to \( x \).

4. **Checking Validity**:
   - The logic for checking valid \( k \) values is correct. Specifically, \( k \) must be even and at least \( x \).
   - The use of `func_1` to get divisors is appropriate.
   - The final step of removing duplicates with `list(set(output))` is unnecessary since the divisors returned by `func_1` are already unique.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) is not considered, which is correct according to the problem statement.
   - The code correctly handles the case where no valid \( k \) values are found.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
