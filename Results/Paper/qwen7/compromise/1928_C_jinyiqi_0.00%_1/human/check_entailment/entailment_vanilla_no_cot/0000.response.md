Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` Function**: 
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find all divisors of a number `x`. However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed. It appends `i` and `int(x / i)` to `output1` and `output2`, but then reverses `output1` and returns `output2 + output1`. This will result in the divisors being in the wrong order and may miss some divisors depending on how they are appended.

2. **Logic for Finding Valid `k` Values**:
   - The logic for determining valid `k` values is incorrect. Specifically, the conditions `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` are not correctly applied to find valid `k` values. The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `k` is even, but the condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` should be checked with respect to the original logic of the problem.

3. **Redundant Code**:
   - The code checks both `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` separately, which is unnecessary. The correct approach would be to check the divisibility of `n - x + 1` by `2k - 2`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is very close to `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    
    count = 0
    for k in range(2, n // 2 + 1):
        if (n - x + 1) % (2 * k - 2) == 0:
            count += 1
            
    print(count)
```

This version directly iterates over possible values of `k` and checks if the condition `(n - x + 1) % (2 * k - 2) == 0` holds true, which correctly identifies the valid `k` values.
