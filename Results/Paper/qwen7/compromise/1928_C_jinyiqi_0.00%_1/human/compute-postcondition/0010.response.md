Output State: **`x` is an integer and divisible by `i + 1`; `i` is an integer and equals `i + 1`; `output1` is a list with the element `i + 1`; `output2` is a list with the element `x / (i + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `int(x / i)` to `output2`. Given that `x` is divisible by `i + 1`, the value of `x / (i + 1)` is an integer. Since `i` is equal to `i + 1`, this condition is not directly useful for calculating the exact value of `x / (i + 1)`, but it confirms the relationship between `x` and `i + 1`. Therefore, `output2` now contains the element `x / (i + 1)`.
