Functionality: **The function `make_array` accepts two integers `left` and `right` (where `left < right`) and an integer `clique`. It constructs an array `arr` and another list `cliquess`. The function sets the elements of `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` to values starting from `small_element` (which is `left + 1`) and incrementing by 1, and sets the corresponding elements in `cliquess` to `clique`. It then sets the elements of `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + not_mid - 1` to values starting from `big_element` (which is `right + 1`) and decrementing by 1, and sets the corresponding elements in `cliquess` to `clique`. After the function executes, the array `arr` and list `cliquess` are updated according to these rules.**
