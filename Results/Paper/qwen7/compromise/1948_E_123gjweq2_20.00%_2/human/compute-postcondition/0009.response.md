Output State: `left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr` is a list where elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to `small_element + i` for `i` in the range `0` to `mid - 1` and elements from index `left + mid` to `left + not_mid - 1` are set to `big_element - (i - mid)` and corresponding `cliquess` is a list where elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to `clique` and elements from index `left + mid` to `left + not_mid - 1` are set to `clique`.
