Reasoning:
- The problem requires assigning distinct integers to vertices such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques based on the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
- The provided solution uses a function `func_1` to achieve this. The function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and then fills the array `arr` such that elements in segments of size `k` are assigned the same value, ensuring that the distance condition is met.
- The `make_array` function is used to fill the array `arr` and the list `cliquess` according to the specified conditions. It divides the segment into two parts and assigns values accordingly.
- Given the constraints and the logic, the solution appears to correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques by ensuring that elements in segments of size `k` are assigned the same value, thus satisfying the condition for forming cliques.

Correctness: **True**

The provided solution meets the requirements of the problem by correctly calculating the number of cliques and assigning values to the vertices such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The logic and implementation seem sound based on the provided state transitions and the problem constraints.
