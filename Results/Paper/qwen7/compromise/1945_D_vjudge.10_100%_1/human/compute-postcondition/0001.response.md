Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. The variables involved here are `i`, `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `pergunta` is a string.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `m` is an integer.
   - `x` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run from `n-1` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`. This means `i` will take values starting from `n-1` down to `0` (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer because the loop starts from `n-1` and goes down to `-1`. If `n` were negative, the loop would never start.
   - The value of `i` will change during each iteration of the loop, but we only need to ensure that the loop can start, which means `n` should be at least 1 (since `range(n-1, -1, -1)` requires `n-1` to be a valid starting point).

5. **Combine the necessary adjustments**:
   - `pergunta` is a string and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of integers and do not affect the loop execution.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `m` is an integer and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `x` is 0 and does not affect the loop execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
