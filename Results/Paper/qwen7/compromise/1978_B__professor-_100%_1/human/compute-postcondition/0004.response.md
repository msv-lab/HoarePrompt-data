Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: n, a, and b. It calculates the total cost of buying n buns where the first bun is sold at a price of b and all subsequent buns are sold at a usual price of a. The function does not return anything explicitly but performs the calculation for each test case.**

Note: The function seems to process multiple test cases internally, each defined by n, a, and b, without accepting these as direct function parameters.
