Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function `func()` correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain from selling the buns under the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Case 1: \( b \leq a \)**
   - If the price of the first bun (`b`) is less than or equal to the usual price (`a`), it is beneficial for Bob to sell all buns at the usual price (`a`). This is because selling even one bun at a lower price would result in a lower total profit compared to selling all at the usual price.
   - The function correctly calculates the profit as `n * a`.

2. **Case 2: \( b - a \geq n \)**
   - If the difference between the price of the first bun (`b`) and the usual price (`a`) is greater than or equal to the number of buns (`n`), it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
   - The function correctly calculates the sum of an arithmetic series using the formula for the sum of the first `k` natural numbers: \( S_k = \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2} \). Here, `k = n`, so the formula becomes \( \frac{n(2b - n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \)**
   - If the difference between the price of the first bun (`b`) and the usual price (`a`) is less than the number of buns (`n`), it is optimal to sell the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price.
   - The function correctly calculates the profit by summing the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns. The sum of the first `k` terms of the sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time is given by \( \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2} \). Adding the usual price for the remaining `n - k` buns gives the total profit.

Given these cases, the function correctly handles all possible scenarios and outputs the maximum profit Bob can obtain. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
