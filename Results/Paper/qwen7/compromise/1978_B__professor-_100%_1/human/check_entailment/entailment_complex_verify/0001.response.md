### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - The profit calculation depends on the value of \( k \), which ranges from 0 to \(\min(n, b)\).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases, \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It checks different conditions to determine the optimal \( k \):

     - **Case 1:** If \( b \leq a \), the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). This is handled correctly with `print(n * a)`.

     - **Case 2:** If \( b - a \geq n \), the best strategy is to sell all buns at the modified prices starting from \( b \) down to \( b - n + 1 \). This is also handled correctly with `print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))`.

     - **Case 3:** Otherwise, the best strategy involves selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price. This is handled with `print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))`.

3. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the logic for each condition:
     - **Case 1:** If \( b \leq a \), the profit is simply \( n \times a \). This is correct.
     - **Case 2:** If \( b - a \geq n \), the profit is calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series from \( b \) to \( b - n + 1 \). The formula used is correct: \(\text{Sum} = \frac{n(2b - n + 1)}{2}\).
     - **Case 3:** Otherwise, the profit is calculated by selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price. The formula used is correct: \(\text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a)(b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when \( b \leq a \) and when \( b - a \geq n \) correctly.
   - The code also handles the general case where \( b - a < n \) correctly.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The overall logic of the program is sound and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the specified conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
