Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic inside the loop checks the conditions and calculates the maximum profit based on the given rules:
   - If `b <= a`, the profit is simply `n * a` because selling all buns at the usual price gives the maximum profit.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the optimal strategy is to sell the first `n` buns at the modified prices `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `n`, which results in the sum of an arithmetic series `2 * b - n + 1` divided by 2, multiplied by `n`.
   - Otherwise, the optimal strategy is to sell the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price `a`. The sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic series `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2` plus the usual price for the remaining buns `a * (n - k)`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly calculate the maximum profit for each test case based on the provided conditions.

Correctness: **True**
