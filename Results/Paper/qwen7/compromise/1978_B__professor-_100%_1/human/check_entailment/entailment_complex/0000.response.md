Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Conditions and Calculations**:
   - If `b <= a`, the program should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is correctly handled with `print(n * a)`.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the program should sell the first `n` buns at the modified prices from `b` to `b - n + 1` and the rest at the usual price `a`. The sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time is given by the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`. This is correctly implemented with `print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2))`.
   - Otherwise, the program should sell the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price `a`. The sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`, and the remaining buns are sold at `a`. This is correctly implemented with `print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n))`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly calculates the maximum profit for each test case based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
