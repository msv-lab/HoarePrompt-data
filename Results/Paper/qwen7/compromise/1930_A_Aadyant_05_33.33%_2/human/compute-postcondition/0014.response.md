Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(a)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `a` must be a positive integer.
   - `list2` contains the integer value of `list1[4]`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must still be a positive integer, but it must be greater than 3 (since `i` is now 3).

5. **State the updated conditions**:
   - `i` must be 3.
   - `a` must be a positive integer greater than 3.
   - The state of `list2` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `a` must be a positive integer greater than 3**.
