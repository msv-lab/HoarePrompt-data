Output State: **`i` is 1; `a` must be a positive integer; `list2` contains the integer value of `list1[0]`**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of `list1[2 * i]` to `list2`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `2 * i` equals 0. So, `list2.append(int(list1[0]))` is executed, appending the integer value of `list1[0]` to `list2`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
