Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is a positive integer, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `list2` as an empty list, which does not affect the values of `t`, `num`, or `out`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `list2` is added as a new variable with its value being an empty list.
