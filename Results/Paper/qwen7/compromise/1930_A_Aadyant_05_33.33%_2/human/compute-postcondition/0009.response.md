Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is a positive integer, `out` is an empty list, `list1` is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the string `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `list1.sort()` sorts the list `list1` in ascending order. Since `list1` was initially a list of strings obtained by splitting the string `b`, after sorting, `list1` will be a sorted list of these strings. The other variables (`t`, `num`, `out`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
