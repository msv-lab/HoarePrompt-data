Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the expected values for a progressive square using the formula \(a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h\), where \(a\) is the minimum value in the input list \(l\), and \(k\) and \(h\) are the row and column indices, respectively.
2. The function then sorts both the generated list `li` and the original list `l`, and checks if they are equal.
3. This approach ensures that the elements in the input list match the expected sequence of a progressive square, given the constraints and the problem description.
4. The function handles all the necessary steps as per the problem requirements and correctly determines whether the input list can form a progressive square.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the function appears to be correctly implemented and should work as intended for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
