### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes four parameters: \( n \), \( c \), \( d \), and a list \( l \).
   - It generates a new list `li` based on the minimum value of \( l \) and the parameters \( c \) and \( d \).
   - Both `l` and `li` are sorted.
   - The function checks if the sorted lists are identical and returns 'yes' if they are, otherwise 'no'.

2. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( c \), and \( d \).
   - It then reads \( n^2 \) integers into the list `l`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

3. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     3 2 3
     3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8
     ```
   - The expected output is "NO".
   - The actual output is "YES".

   Let's break down the steps:
   - The minimum value in `l` is 1.
   - The generated list `li` is `[1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12]`.
   - The sorted list `l` is `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

   The program incorrectly returns "YES" because it only checks if the sorted lists are identical, but it does not check if the elements match the exact sequence required for a progressive square.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the given array `l` can form a progressive square.
   - The function `func_1` does not ensure that the generated sequence matches the given array `l` in terms of both the elements and their positions.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to verify if the given array `l` can form a progressive square. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

**Final: False**
