Output State: **`li` now contains the value of `a + k * c + d * h` and `h` is `h + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Initially, `li` contained the value of `a + k * c + d * (h + 1)`, and `h` was incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value appended to `li` is `a + k * c + d * h`. The value of `h` is now `h + 1`.
