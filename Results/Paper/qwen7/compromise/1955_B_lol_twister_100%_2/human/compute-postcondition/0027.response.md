Output State: **`li` now contains the value of `a + k * c + d * (h + 1)`, and `h` is `h + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Additionally, `h` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state of `h` was `h + 1`, after the increment, `h` becomes `(h + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `h + 2`. However, since the output state only needs to reflect the changes made by the code, we keep `h` as `h + 1` and note that the new element in `li` is calculated using the updated `h`.
