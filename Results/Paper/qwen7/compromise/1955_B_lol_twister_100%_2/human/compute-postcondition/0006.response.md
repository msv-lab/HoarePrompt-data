Output State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 1, `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * 1` and the appended value `a + k * c + d * h`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given that `k` is 0 and `h` is 1, the appended value simplifies to `a + 0 * c + d * 1`, which further simplifies to `a + d`. Therefore, the list `li` now contains two elements: the original value `a + k * c + d * 1` (which is `a + d` since `k` is 0) and the newly appended value `a + d`.
