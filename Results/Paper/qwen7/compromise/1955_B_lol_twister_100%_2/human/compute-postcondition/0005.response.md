Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `h`. The range of `h` is from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
   - `k` is 0
   - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive
   - `h` is 0
   - `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * h`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `h` starts from 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, `h` should be 1.
   - The value of `li` will now be `a + k * c + d * 1` because `h` is now 1.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `h` is updated to 1.
   - `li` is updated to `a + k * c + d * 1`.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 1, `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * 1`**
