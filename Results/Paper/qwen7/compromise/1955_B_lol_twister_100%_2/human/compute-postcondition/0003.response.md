State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, h is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `h` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a valid value (between 2 and 500 inclusive).
3. The variable `h` starts at 0 as per the range function `range(0, n)`.
4. The initial state of `k` (which is 0) does not affect the loop's execution and can remain unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (to ensure it is between 2 and 500 inclusive) and `h` (which starts at 0).
