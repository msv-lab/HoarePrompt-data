Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n-1)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged, and the condition that `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices` and `path` now includes the value of `v` removed also remains valid.
