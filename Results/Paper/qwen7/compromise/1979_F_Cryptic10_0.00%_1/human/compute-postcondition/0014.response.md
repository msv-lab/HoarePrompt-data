Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `d`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means `d` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `v` is 0
   - `u` is a value returned by `func_1(d)`
   - `path` is a list containing 0
   - `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding 0
   - `d` is `n-1`
   - The most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `d` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `d` should be `n-2`.
   - All other variables (`v`, `u`, `path`, `remaining_vertices`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`v` is 0, `u` is a value returned by `func_1(n-2)`, `path` is a list containing 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding 0, `d` is `n-2`**
