Output State: **`d` is -1, `n` is the same as before, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `d`, `n`, `v`, and `u`, and the `continue` statement does not affect their values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
