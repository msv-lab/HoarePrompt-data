Output State: **`v` is 0; `u` is a value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding 0, `d` is `n-1`.**

Explanation: The code removes the value of `v` (which is 0) from the set `remaining_vertices`. After this operation, `remaining_vertices` will no longer contain the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
