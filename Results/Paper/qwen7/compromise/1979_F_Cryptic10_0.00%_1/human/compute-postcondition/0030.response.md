Output State: **`v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0, `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. The values of `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
