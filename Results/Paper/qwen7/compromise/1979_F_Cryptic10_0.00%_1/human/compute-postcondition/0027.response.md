Postcondition: **`v` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `u` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0 and `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding `v`, and `d` is `n-2`. If `v` equals 0, no changes are made to `path` or `remaining_vertices`.**
