Output State: **`v` is 0, `u` is a value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n`, `d` is `n-1`.**

The `continue` statement does not change any variable values or affect the state of the variables. It merely skips to the next iteration of the loop (if there is one). Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
