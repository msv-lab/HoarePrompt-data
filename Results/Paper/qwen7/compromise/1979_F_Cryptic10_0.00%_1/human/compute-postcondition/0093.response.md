Postcondition: `d` is -1, `v` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, there is no change in the values of `d`, `v`, and `u`.
