Output State: **`d` is -1, `v` is 0, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to exit the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables. Therefore, the values of `d`, `v`, and `u` remain unchanged from their initial states.
