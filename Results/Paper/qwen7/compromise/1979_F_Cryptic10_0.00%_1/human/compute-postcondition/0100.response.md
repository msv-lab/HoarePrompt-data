Output State: **`d` is `n-1`, `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(n-1)`, and `path` now includes the value of `v` removed.**

Explanation: The line `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the value of `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. Since `v` was previously in `remaining_vertices` (as it was the second return value of `func_1(n-1)`), it is no longer present in `remaining_vertices` after this operation. The values of `d`, `u`, and `path` remain unchanged except that `v` is no longer part of `path`.
