Output State: **`d` is -1, `v` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(-1)`, and `remaining_vertices` does not contain `v`.**

Explanation: The code removes the value `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. Since `v` was originally in `remaining_vertices`, after executing `remaining_vertices.remove(v)`, `v` is no longer in the list. The values of `d`, `v`, `u`, and `path` remain unchanged.
