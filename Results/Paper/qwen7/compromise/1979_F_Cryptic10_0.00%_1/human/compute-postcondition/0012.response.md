Postcondition: `v` is 0, `u` is a value returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` is a list containing 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` excluding 0, and `d` is `n-1`. This is because if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, leading to the specified changes in the variables. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, no changes occur.
