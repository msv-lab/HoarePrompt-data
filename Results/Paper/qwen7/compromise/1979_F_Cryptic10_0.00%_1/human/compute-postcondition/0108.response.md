Output State: **`d` is -1, `v` is the last return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` is the corresponding second return value of `func_1(-1)`, `path` contains all vertices that satisfied the given conditions during the iterations, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the standard output stream. Since no variables are modified by this line of code, the values of `d`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged from their previous states. Specifically, `d` reaches `-1` indicating the end of the loop, `v` holds the last return value of `func_1(-1)`, `u` holds the corresponding second return value, `path` contains all vertices that met the condition, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set as all vertices have been processed.
