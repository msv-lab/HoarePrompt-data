The function accepts two parameters, `q` (an integer) and `x` (an integer). It calculates the integer square root of `q` and stores it in `w`. If `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `w` to the list `M`. Then, it iterates through all integers from 1 to `w` (excluding `w` itself), checking if they are divisors of `q` and adding them to `M` if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Finally, it returns the list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
