Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculating the Range of `k`:**
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case. Otherwise, it proceeds to the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It uses a square root approximation to find potential divisors and then checks all divisors up to the square root.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `3 * x - 2`, the program includes additional divisors from `(n - x) // 2`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the set of divisors found by `func_1`.

### Detailed Check:

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The edge case where `y` is odd is correctly handled by printing `0`.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The logic for finding divisors using the square root approximation is sound.

3. **Inclusion of Additional Divisors:**
   - The inclusion of additional divisors from `(n - x) // 2` when `n >= 3 * x - 2` is correctly implemented.

4. **Set Conversion:**
   - Converting the list of divisors to a set ensures unique values, which is necessary for counting distinct `k` values.

5. **Output Length:**
   - The length of the set of divisors is correctly printed as the number of valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the provided code.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
