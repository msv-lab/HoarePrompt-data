You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, x and n are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.

    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: Postcondition: `q` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ `x` < `n` ≤ 10^9, `M` is a list containing one element which is `w`.

    return M
    #The program returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `q` (an integer) and `x` (an integer). It calculates the integer square root of `q` and stores it in `w`. If `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `w` to the list `M`. Then, it iterates through all integers from 1 to `w` (excluding `w` itself), checking if they are divisors of `q` and adding them to `M` if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. Finally, it returns the list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculating the Range of `k`:**
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case. Otherwise, it proceeds to the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It uses a square root approximation to find potential divisors and then checks all divisors up to the square root.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `3 * x - 2`, the program includes additional divisors from `(n - x) // 2`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the set of divisors found by `func_1`.

### Detailed Check:

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The edge case where `y` is odd is correctly handled by printing `0`.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The logic for finding divisors using the square root approximation is sound.

3. **Inclusion of Additional Divisors:**
   - The inclusion of additional divisors from `(n - x) // 2` when `n >= 3 * x - 2` is correctly implemented.

4. **Set Conversion:**
   - Converting the list of divisors to a set ensures unique values, which is necessary for counting distinct `k` values.

5. **Output Length:**
   - The length of the set of divisors is correctly printed as the number of valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the provided code.
