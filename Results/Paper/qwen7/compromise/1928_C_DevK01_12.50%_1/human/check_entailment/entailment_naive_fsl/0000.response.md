Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid `k` values. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not used correctly, and the logic to determine the valid `k` values is flawed.

Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is intended to generate a list of possible `k` values, but it is not being used correctly. The variable `L1` is supposed to store the results from `func_1`, but the logic to filter and count valid `k` values is missing.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but this calculation is not necessary for determining the valid `k` values. Instead, the modulo operation should be used to find the position within the repeating cycle of `2k - 2`.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `x` is close to `n`, the program may not correctly identify the valid `k` values.

To fix the program, the following steps are needed:
- Correctly calculate the position within the repeating cycle using modulo.
- Properly use the `func_1` function to generate the list of valid `k` values.
- Ensure that the logic correctly filters and counts the valid `k` values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    # Calculate the position within the repeating cycle
    pos = (n - 1) % (2 * x - 2)
    if pos < x:
        # Check if the position is valid for the given x
        ans = 1
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version directly calculates the position within the repeating cycle and checks if it is valid, which simplifies the logic and ensures correctness.
