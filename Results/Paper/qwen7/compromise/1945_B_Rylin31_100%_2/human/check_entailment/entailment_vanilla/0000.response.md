Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes, and from the second installation every `b` minutes. Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

### Key Points
1. **Frequency of Launching**: 
   - First installation: every `a` minutes.
   - Second installation: every `b` minutes.
   
2. **Visibility Time**: 
   - A firework launched at time `x` is visible from `x` to `x + m`.

3. **Objective**: 
   - Determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

### Given Program
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)
```

### Reasoning
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `a`, `b`, and `m` for each case.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `m // a + m // b + 2` is used to calculate the result.
     - `m // a` gives the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible at any given time.
     - `m // b` gives the number of fireworks from the second installation that are visible at any given time.
     - Adding `2` accounts for the possibility of a firework from each installation being visible at the same time.

### Correctness Check
- **Edge Cases**:
  - When `a` and `b` are coprime, the formula might not account for all overlaps correctly.
  - When `a` and `b` have common factors, the formula might overestimate the number of simultaneous visible fireworks.

- **Mathematical Insight**:
  - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not accurately capture the maximum number of simultaneous visible fireworks. It assumes that every firework from each installation is visible at different times, which is not necessarily true.

### Example Analysis
- **Example 1**: `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`
  - `m // a = 0` (since 4 < 6)
  - `m // b = 0` (since 4 < 7)
  - Result: `0 + 0 + 2 = 2`
  - This seems correct as per the example.

- **Example 3**: `a = 7`, `b = 8`, `m = 56`
  - `m // a = 8` (since 56 // 7 = 8)
  - `m // b = 7` (since 56 // 8 = 7)
  - Result: `8 + 7 + 2 = 17`
  - This also seems correct as per the example.

However, the formula does not consider the overlap correctly, leading to potential inaccuracies.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not account for the overlaps between the fireworks from both installations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**
