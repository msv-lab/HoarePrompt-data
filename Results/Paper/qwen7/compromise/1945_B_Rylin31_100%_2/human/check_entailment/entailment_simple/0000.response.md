Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. However, this formula is incorrect for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. 

To understand why, let's analyze the problem:

- Each firework launched by the first installation is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
- Each firework launched by the second installation is also visible for `m + 1` minutes.
- The key point is that we need to find the maximum overlap of these intervals.

The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of the combined firing pattern and then calculate the maximum number of overlapping intervals within the visibility period `m`.

However, the given solution does not account for the LCM and instead uses a simple arithmetic sum which does not correctly capture the overlapping intervals.

Given this analysis, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
