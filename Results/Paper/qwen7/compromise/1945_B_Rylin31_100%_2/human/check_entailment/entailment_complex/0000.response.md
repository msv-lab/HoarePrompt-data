Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, the program correctly reads the integers `a`, `b`, and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. This formula is derived from the fact that:
   - `m // a` gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period of `m` minutes.
   - `m // b` gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the same period.
   - Adding `2` accounts for the possibility that a firework from each installation could be visible at the exact same time (if they coincide within the last `m` minutes).
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated value for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given that the program follows the problem statement accurately and performs the necessary calculations correctly, the program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
