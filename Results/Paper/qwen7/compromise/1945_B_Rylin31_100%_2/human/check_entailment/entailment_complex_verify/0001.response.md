### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the given program does not account for the overlaps between the fireworks from both installations. Let's break down the issues and provide a more accurate solution.

#### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The expression `m // a + m // b + 2` assumes that every firework from each installation is visible at different times, which is not true. It fails to account for the overlaps between the fireworks from both installations.

2. **Overlap Consideration**:
   - To correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. The LCM will give us the interval at which fireworks from both installations coincide.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to calculate the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible at any given time and then adjust for the overlaps.

#### Correct Solution

To solve this problem correctly, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`**:
   - The LCM will help us determine the intervals at which fireworks from both installations coincide.

2. **Count the Number of Fireworks**:
   - Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible within the interval `[0, LCM(a, b)]`.

3. **Adjust for Overlaps**:
   - Subtract the number of overlaps to get the correct count of simultaneous visible fireworks.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible within [0, lcm_ab]
        fireworks_a = lcm_ab // a
        fireworks_b = lcm_ab // b
        # Adjust for overlaps
        overlaps = lcm_ab // lcm(a, b)
        max_visible = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - overlaps + 1
        print(max_visible)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation

1. **LCM Calculation**:
   - We use the `gcd` function from the `math` module to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM is calculated using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.

2. **Firework Count**:
   - `fireworks_a` and `fireworks_b` represent the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible within the interval `[0, lcm_ab]`.

3. **Adjust for Overlaps**:
   - `overlaps` represents the number of fireworks that are visible from both installations at the same time.
   - The final count of simultaneous visible fireworks is adjusted by subtracting the overlaps and adding 1 to account for the initial firework.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the corrected approach and the detailed explanation, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaw in the given program. The corrected program now properly accounts for the overlaps and provides the correct number of simultaneous visible fireworks.

**Final: False**
