Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. According to the problem description, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time would be the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period plus one (for the overlap condition).

However, the program calculates `m // a + m // b + 2`, which does not account for the correct overlap condition. Specifically, it does not consider the exact moment when fireworks from both installations coincide within the visibility period.

For example, consider the input `(a=6, b=7, m=4)`:
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times `[6, 12, 18, 24]`.
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times `[7, 14, 21, 28]`.

Within the visibility period of 4 minutes, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time should be 2 (one from each installation), but the program incorrectly calculates `4 // 6 + 4 // 7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2`, which is correct in this specific case but fails in other scenarios where the overlap condition is not correctly handled.

A correct approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculating the number of fireworks launched within the visibility period considering the LCM.
