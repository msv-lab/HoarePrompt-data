### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it correctly reads the number of sticks `n` and the values of `a_i`.

2. **Counting Sticks:**
   - The program uses an array `v` to count the occurrences of each unique value of \(2^{a_i}\).
   - This is done correctly by iterating through the list of `a_i` values and incrementing the corresponding index in `v`.

3. **Triangle Formation:**
   - To form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
   - The program checks for valid triangles by considering the counts of each unique stick length.
   - It calculates the number of valid combinations using combinatorial formulas:
     - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 out of these sticks and pairs them with any other stick.
     - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 out of these sticks.

4. **Combination Calculations:**
   - The program uses the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \) to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 sticks.
   - The calculations are performed correctly, ensuring that the total count of valid triangles is accurate.

5. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result for each test case to a list and prints the results in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles from the given sticks.
