Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list a containing n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with specific parameters and a list of integers, and process these inputs to produce a result for each test case without accepting any parameters itself.
