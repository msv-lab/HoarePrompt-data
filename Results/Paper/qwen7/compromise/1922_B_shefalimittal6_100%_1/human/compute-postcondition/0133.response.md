Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ans` is increased by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Given the initial postcondition, `v[i]` is already greater than or equal to 3, so the value of `v[i]` remains unchanged. The only change is the updated value of `ans` due to the addition.
