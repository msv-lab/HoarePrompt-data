Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was increased by 1.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`:**
   - Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute Again:**
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n + 1`.
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and goes up to `n`, the loop will execute again if `k + 1 < n + 1`.
   - This simplifies to `k < n`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`.
   - After the loop increments `i`, the new value of `i` is `k + 1`.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since `i` was increased by 1, the new value of `i` is `k + 1`.
   - All other variables retain their values from the precondition.

Given this reasoning, let's formulate the answer:

State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is now `k + 1`, and all other variables retain their values from the precondition.**

Since `i` was increased by 1, the new value of `i` is `k + 1`. However, since we don't know the exact value of `k` from the previous iteration, we can represent it as `i` being increased by 1.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[i]`, and `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`, and all other variables retain their values from the precondition.**
