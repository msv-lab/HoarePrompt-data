Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `cnt` is `v[i]`, `ans` is `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`, and `v[i]` is updated such that if `v[i] >= 2`, then `ans` is incremented by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. If `v[i] < 2`, then `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. The value of `i` and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial postconditions. The condition for updating `ans` based on the value of `v[i]` is also preserved.
