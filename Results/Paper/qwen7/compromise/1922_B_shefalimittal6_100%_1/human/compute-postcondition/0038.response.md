Output State: **`cnt` is `v[idx]`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is either `v[4 + n] * (v[4 + n] - 1) * (v[4 + n] - 2) // 6` if `v[4 + n]` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `ans` remains `ans`; `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `n` must be non-negative, `i` is 5.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `cnt` is equal to `v[idx]` where `idx` is `4 + n`.
- The variable `ans` is either `v[4 + n] * (v[4 + n] - 1) * (v[4 + n] - 2) // 6` if `v[4 + n]` is greater than or equal to 3, or remains unchanged if `v[4 + n]` is less than 3.
- The variable `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. Since `i` is 5, this means `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[5] * (v[5] - 1) // 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
