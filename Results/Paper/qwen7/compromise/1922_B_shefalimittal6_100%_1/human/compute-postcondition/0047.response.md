Postcondition: `cnt` is `v[9]`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is updated based on the value of `v[6]`. Specifically, if `v[6] >= 2`, then `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[6] * (v[6] - 1) // 2` to its current value. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change if the condition `v[6] >= 2` is not met.
