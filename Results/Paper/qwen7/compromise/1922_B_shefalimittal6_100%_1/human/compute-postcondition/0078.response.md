Output State: **`ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, and all other variables retain their values from the precondition.**

This means that the value of `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to its current value. All other variables, such as `v[i]`, `cnt`, and any others mentioned in the initial state, remain unchanged from their original values.
