Output State: **`ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`, `i` is `n`, `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. Here, `i` is equal to `n`, and `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2. The values of `cnt` and `v[i]` are used directly in the calculation. The other variables remain unchanged.
