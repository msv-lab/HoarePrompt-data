Output State: **`cnt` is `v[idx]`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is either `v[4 + n] * (v[4 + n] - 1) * (v[4 + n] - 2) // 6` if the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, or remains unchanged if the current value of `v[i]` is less than 3, `n` must be non-negative.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increments `cnt` by the value of `v[i]`. Given that `idx` is defined as `4 + n`, `idx` remains unchanged. The value of `ans` is determined based on the condition involving `v[4 + n]`, which is unchanged. The value of `n` remains non-negative.
