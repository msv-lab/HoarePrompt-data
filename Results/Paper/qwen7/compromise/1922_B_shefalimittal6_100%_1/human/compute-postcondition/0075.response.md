Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `idx` is equal to the initial value plus `n`; `ans` is 0; `v[data[idx]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value 0, which does not affect the other variables. The value of `idx` remains as the initial value plus `n`. The value of `v[data[idx]]` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `v[data[idx]]` is not specified in the initial state, so it is only noted that it has been incremented.
