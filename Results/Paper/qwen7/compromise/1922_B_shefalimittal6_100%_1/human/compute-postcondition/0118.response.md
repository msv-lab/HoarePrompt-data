Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n)`. This means the loop variable is an underscore `_`, and it iterates `n` times. However, the loop itself does not change the values of `n`, `idx`, or `v[x]` directly within the loop body (since the loop body is omitted). Instead, the loop increments `idx` and `v[x]` based on the value of `x` from `data[idx]`.

2. **Determine the state changes**:
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `v[x]` is increased by 1.
   - `x` is an integer from `data[idx]`.
   - `idx` is increased by 1 again.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs `n` times, and assuming `n` is at least 1, the first iteration already occurred. For the next iteration, `idx` will be increased by 1 again.
   - `v[x]` will be increased by 1 based on the value of `x` from `data[idx]`.
   - `x` will be the next integer from `data[idx]` (which is now `idx + 1`).

Given that the loop runs `n` times, and assuming `n` is at least 1, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `idx` is increased by 1 again.
- `v[x]` is increased by 1 based on the new value of `x` from `data[idx]`.

Since the exact value of `x` is dependent on the current value of `idx`, and `idx` is increased by 1, the new value of `x` will be the integer from `data[idx]` where `idx` is now `previous_idx + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`idx` is increased by 1, `v[x]` is increased by 1, where `x` is an integer from `data[idx]`**
