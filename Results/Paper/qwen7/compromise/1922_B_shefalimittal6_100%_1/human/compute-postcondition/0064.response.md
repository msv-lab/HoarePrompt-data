Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `n`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `v[x]` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - The value of `idx` and `v[x]` are not directly relevant to the loop condition but are modified within the loop body.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `n`, we need to ensure `n` is still greater than or equal to 1 for the next iteration.
   - The values of `idx` and `v[x]` are not part of the loop condition and can be left as they are since they are modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
