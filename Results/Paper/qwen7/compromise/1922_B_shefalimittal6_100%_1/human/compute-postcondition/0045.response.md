Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is initially set to 5.
   - `n` is non-negative.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n + 1`.

4. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is `v[9]`.
   - `idx` is equal to `4 + n`.
   - `ans` is updated based on the value of `v[4 + n]`.
   - `n` must be non-negative.
   - `i` is 5.
   - `cnt` is increased by `v[5]`.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 5, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 5.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 6.
   - `cnt` will remain the same as it was not modified in the loop body (since no specific operation on `cnt` is mentioned in the loop body).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will be 6.
- `n` must be greater than 5.

The other variables (`cnt`, `idx`, `ans`) do not change because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not directly affected by the loop condition.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cnt` is `v[9]`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is updated based on the value of `v[4 + n]`, `n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 6**
