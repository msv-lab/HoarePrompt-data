Output State: `results` is a list containing the string representation of the final value of `ans` after all iterations of the loop have completed, `cnt` is the total count of non-zero elements in the list `v` summed across all iterations, `idx` is equal to `3 * t + 1`, and `ans` is the cumulative sum of all increments based on the values of `v[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `2 * n` across all iterations.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain a single string representing the final computed value of `ans`. The variable `cnt` will hold the total count of non-zero elements encountered in the list `v` across all iterations. The variable `idx` will point to the position right after the last processed element in the `data` list, which would be `3 * t + 1` since `t` is the number of iterations and we start processing from index 2. The variable `ans` will be the aggregated result of applying the given formulas to the lists `v` generated in each iteration.
