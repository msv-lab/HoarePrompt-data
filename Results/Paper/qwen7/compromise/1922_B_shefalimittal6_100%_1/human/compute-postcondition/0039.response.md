Postcondition: `cnt` is `v[idx]`, `idx` is equal to `4 + n`, `ans` is updated as follows: if `v[4 + n]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is set to `v[4 + n] * (v[4 + n] - 1) * (v[4 + n] - 2) // 6` and then incremented by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. If `v[4 + n]` is less than 3, `ans` remains unchanged. `n` must be non-negative, `i` is 5.
