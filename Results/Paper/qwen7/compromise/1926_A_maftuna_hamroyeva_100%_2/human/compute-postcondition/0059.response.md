Postcondition: `a` is an empty string or a non-empty string, `j` is the last character of `a`, `l` is the total count of 'A' characters in `a`, and `h` is the count of characters in `a` that are not 'A'. If `l` is greater than `h`, the function continues under that condition. Otherwise, `l` is less than or equal to `h`.
