Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty input string, `l` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the first character of `a` is 'A', `h` is equal to 1 (since it was previously `l` and now incremented by 1), `j` is the second character of `a`.**

The value of `h` is incremented by 1, making it equal to the current value of `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
