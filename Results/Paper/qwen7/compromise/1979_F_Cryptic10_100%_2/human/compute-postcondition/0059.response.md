Output State: **`ops` is a list containing either one or two tuples., `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except the second last one., `p2` is an empty list., `v1` is the second last element of the updated `vx` minus 2., `v2` is the second last element of the updated `vx`, `vx` has had its second last element removed.**

Explanation: The code `vx.remove(v1)` removes the element `v1` from the list `vx`. Since `v1` was the second last element of `vx`, removing it means `v2` (which was the second last element before removal) is now the new second last element. All other variables (`ops`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.
