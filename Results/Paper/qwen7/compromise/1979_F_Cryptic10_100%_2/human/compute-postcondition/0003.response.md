The only variable in the loop head is `len(vx)`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `len(vx) > 2`. Right before the loop, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer `t` (inclusive). For the loop to execute the first time, the length of `vx` must be greater than 2.

Given that `vx` contains integers from 1 to `t`, the length of `vx` is `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to `t` (inclusive), `ops` is an empty list**
