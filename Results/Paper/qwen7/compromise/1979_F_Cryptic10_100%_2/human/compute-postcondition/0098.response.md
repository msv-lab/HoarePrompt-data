Postcondition: `p2` contains ['a', 'a'], `ops` is a list that either contains [('v1', v2)] where `v2` is greater than 0, or contains [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)] where `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)` and `v2` is less than or equal to 0. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n excluding the last two integers, and if `v2` is not greater than 0, `vx` excludes the element `v3`.
