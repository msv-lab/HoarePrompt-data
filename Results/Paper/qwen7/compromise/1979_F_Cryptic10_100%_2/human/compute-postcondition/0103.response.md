Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 3`, and `ops` has an additional element `(v1, v2)`.**

Explanation: The line `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Given that `v1` was originally `len(vx) - 3` and `v2` was `len(vx) - 2`, after the operation, `v1` becomes `len(vx) - 4` and `v2` becomes `len(vx) - 3`. The list `ops` now contains an additional element, which is the tuple `(v1, v2)`.
