Output State: **`ops` is a list containing either one or two tuples., `p1` contains the elements of `vx` except the second last one., `p2` is an empty list., `v1` is the second last element of the updated `vx` minus 2., `v2` is the second last element of the updated `vx`.**

Explanation: The code `v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)` assigns `v1` and `v2` based on the length of `vx` minus 2. Here, `v2` is explicitly stated to be the second last element of `vx`. Since `v1` is derived from `v2` by subtracting 2, `v1` is the second last element of `vx` minus 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
