Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a lambda function `q` is defined which prints '? %d' % d followed by reading a line of input and splitting it into integers, and these integers are returned as a map object.**

The lambda function `q` is defined but no values are passed to it, so the variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The function `q` itself is now available as a variable `q`.
