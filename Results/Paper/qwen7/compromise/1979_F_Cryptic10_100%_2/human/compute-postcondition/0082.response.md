Output State: **`p2` is a list containing the elements of its original content followed by 'a', 'a', `ops` remains unchanged, `vx` remains unchanged, `v1` is 'a', `v2` is 'b'**.

Explanation: The code `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)` checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. Since `v2` is `'b'` and there's no mention of `p1` in the initial state, we assume `p1` is not defined or irrelevant to the current context. Thus, the condition `p1[-1] == v2` is false, and the code evaluates to `p1`. However, since `p1` is not defined, the code defaults to `p2`. Then, `v1` which is `'a'` is appended to `p2`. Therefore, `p2` now contains its original content followed by `'a'` and another `'a'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
