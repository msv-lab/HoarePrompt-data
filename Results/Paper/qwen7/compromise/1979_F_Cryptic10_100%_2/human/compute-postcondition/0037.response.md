Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `(v1, v2) in ops[::-1]`. This means the loop iterates over the reversed `ops` list, where each element is a tuple containing two values `v1` and `v2`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ops` contains valid tuples.
   - The length of `ops` matches the number of iterations.
   - The last tuple's first element is `v1`.
   - The last tuple's second element is `v2`.
   - The list within the last tuple is appended with `v1`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, the next tuple in the reversed list would be the second-to-last tuple from the original `ops` list.
   - Therefore, the next `v1` would be the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
   - Similarly, the next `v2` would be the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The length of `ops` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration because the loop has not yet removed or modified the list itself.
   - The last tuple's first element (`v1`) and second element (`v2`) will now refer to the first and second elements of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
   - The list within the last tuple is not directly referenced in the loop head, so its state does not change for the purpose of this adjustment.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `ops` contains valid tuples, the length of `ops` matches the number of iterations, the last tuple's first element is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list, the last tuple's second element is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list**.
