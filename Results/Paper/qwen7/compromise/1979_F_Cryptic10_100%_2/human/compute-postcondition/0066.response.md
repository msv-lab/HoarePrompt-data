Output State: **`vx` must have more than 2 elements; `v1` is the element at index len(vx) - 2; `v2` is the element at index len(vx) - 1.**

Explanation: The code `v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)` assigns the elements of `vx` at indices `len(vx) - 2` and `len(vx) - 1` to `v1` and `v2`, respectively. Since `vx` must have more than 2 elements, the indices `len(vx) - 2` and `len(vx) - 1` are valid, and the values at these indices are assigned to `v1` and `v2`. The precondition that `vx` must have more than 2 elements remains valid.
