Output State: **`vx` has one less element than before, `v1` is now removed from `vx`, `v2` is the new last element of `vx`, `v3` is the first element returned by function `q(0)`.**

Explanation: The code `v3, _ = q(0)` calls the function `q(0)`, which returns two values. The first value is assigned to `v3`, and the second value is ignored (denoted by `_`). The precondition that `vx` has one less element than before, `v1` is now removed from `vx`, and `v2` is the new last element of `vx` remains unchanged. Therefore, `v3` is the first element returned by the function `q(0)`.
