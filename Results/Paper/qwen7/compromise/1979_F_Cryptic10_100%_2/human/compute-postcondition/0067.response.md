Output State: **`vx` has one less element than before, `v1` is now removed from `vx`, and `v2` is the new last element of `vx`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `len(vx) - 2` (which was `v1`) from the list `vx`. After this operation, `vx` has one less element. Since `v1` is no longer in the list, `v2` is now the new last element of `vx`.
