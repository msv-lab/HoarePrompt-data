Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is defined by the tuple `(v1, v2)` from the reversed `ops` list. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `v1` and `v2`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `ops` to be processed. Since the list is being reversed (`ops[::-1]`), the loop will process elements from the end of the original `ops` list.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p2` is appended with `v1`.
   - `ops` remains unchanged.
   - `vx` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `ops[::-1]` must be available. This means `ops` should still have at least one element.
   - After processing the current element `(v1, v2)` from `ops[::-1]`, `v1` and `v2` will be the values of the next element in the reversed list.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `p2` will be appended with `v1` again (since it was appended in the previous iteration).
   - `ops` remains unchanged because the loop will continue to process the next element if it exists.
   - `vx` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`p2` is appended with `v1`, `ops` remains unchanged, `vx` remains unchanged**.
