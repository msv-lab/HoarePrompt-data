Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( t \) and \( n \). For each test case, it maintains a set of integers and performs operations based on user-provided inputs. After processing, it reconstructs and prints a sequence of integers based on the operations performed. The final output is a sequence of integers for each test case, formatted as a space-separated string.**
