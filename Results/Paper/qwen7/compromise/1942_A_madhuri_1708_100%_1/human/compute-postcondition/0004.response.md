Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It reads these integers from standard input, checks the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \), and prints either a sequence of \( k \) occurrences of \( k \) (if \( n = k \) and \( k \geq 2 \)), a sequence of numbers from 1 to \( n \) (if \( k = 1 \)), or -1 (otherwise). The output is printed to standard output, with each line corresponding to one test case.**
