### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to understand its behavior and verify the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)
```
This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both `a` and `b`.

#### Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
    vprod = [den // r for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if den <= 0:
        print(-1)
        return
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```
1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.
2. **Calculating Denominator (`den`)**: It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and then iteratively applies `func_1` to update `den` with the LCM of `den` and each subsequent multiplier.
3. **Calculating `vprod`**: It computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding multiplier in `vals`.
4. **Checking Condition**: It subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den`. If the result is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.

#### Analysis of the Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases because it does not account for the strict inequality condition. Let's verify this claim.

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     5 5 5 5 5
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     -1
     ```
   - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that no valid distribution exists because the total bet would be equal to the winnings for each outcome.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     6 3 2
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     -1
     ```
   - Explanation: The program correctly identifies that no valid distribution exists because the total bet would be equal to the winnings for each outcome.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input:
     ```
     5
     9 4 6 8 3
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     8 18 12 9 24
     ```
   - Explanation: The program correctly identifies a valid distribution of coins that ensures the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement. It correctly identifies when no valid distribution exists and provides a valid distribution when one exists.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.
