Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - It uses the formula: \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)} \).
   - This function is correctly implemented.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the input for a single test case.
   - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier value.
   - It iterates through all multipliers and updates `den` using `func_1` to find the least common multiple of all multipliers.
   - It then computes `vprod` as the list of values where each element is `den // r` for each multiplier `r`.
   - It calculates `den - sum(vprod)` to find the remaining value after distributing the bets according to the computed multipliers.
   - If the remaining value `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets as a space-separated string of integers.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Multiplier Calculation**:
   - The initialization of `den` with the first multiplier is correct.
   - Using `func_1` to update `den` by finding the LCM of all multipliers is also correct because the LCM ensures that the total bet is a multiple of each individual bet required to match the multipliers.

2. **Bet Distribution**:
   - The computation of `vprod` as `den // r` for each multiplier `r` is correct because it ensures that the total bet is evenly distributed among the multipliers.
   - The check `den - sum(vprod)` is necessary to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the sum of the multipliers times their respective bets.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`.
   - The program outputs the correct bets when a valid distribution exists.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the sum of the multipliers times their respective bets. The program handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
