Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program attempts to find a common denominator for the multipliers and then distributes the coins based on that denominator. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
3
5
5 5 5 5 5
3
6 3 2
5
9 4 6 8 3
```

- Expected Output:
```
-1
-1
8 18 12 9 24
```

For the first two test cases, the program incorrectly outputs a valid distribution of coins because it does not account for the strict inequality condition. For the third test case, the program correctly outputs `-1` because no valid distribution exists.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome. The current implementation does not enforce this condition, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
