Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'NO', 'YES', and 'MAYBE' responses based on the comparison between the k-th largest element and the f-th element in the sorted list of integers a for each test case. Each 'NO' indicates that the k-th largest element is smaller than the f-th element, 'YES' indicates that the k-th largest element is greater than the f-th element, and 'MAYBE' indicates that the k-th largest element is equal to the f-th element but with additional conditions (k is not the last element and the element before k is smaller than the f-th element) that make the answer uncertain.
