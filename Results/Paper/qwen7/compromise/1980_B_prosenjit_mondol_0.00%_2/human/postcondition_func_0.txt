The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \) along with a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It then sorts the list \( a \) in descending order. After sorting, it compares the \( k \)-th largest element with the \( f \)-th element. If the \( k \)-th largest element is greater than the \( f \)-th element, it prints 'NO'. If the \( k \)-th largest element is less than the \( f \)-th element, it prints 'YES'. If they are equal, it prints 'YES' unless the \( k \)-th element is the second largest element in the list, in which case it prints 'MAYBE'.
