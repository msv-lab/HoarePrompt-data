Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when the value of the favorite cube is equal to the value of the k-th cube after sorting, but the k-th cube is not the last cube. Hereâ€™s why the solution is incorrect:

1. **Sorting and Indexing**: The code sorts the list `a` in reverse order and checks if the k-th element is greater than the value of the favorite cube (`x`). However, if the k-th element is equal to the value of the favorite cube, it should further check whether the (k-1)-th element is less than the value of the favorite cube to determine if the favorite cube would be removed.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The current logic does not correctly handle the scenario where the k-th cube is the same value as the favorite cube but is not the last cube in the sorted list. This results in an incorrect determination of whether the favorite cube will be removed.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        f -= 1
        k -= 1
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = a[f]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Check if the k-th cube is the same as the favorite cube
        if a[k] == x:
            # Further check if the (k-1)-th cube is less than the favorite cube
            if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('MAYBE')
        elif a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all edge cases correctly, making the solution more robust.
