Postcondition: **`work` is either False or True, `i` is either 3 or 4, `ans` is the first character of `a` concatenated with `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `counter` is 3, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string with length greater than 0, `b` is the new input string, and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` is less than or equal to the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.**

This means that after executing the if-else block, `work` remains either False or True, `i` becomes either 3 or 4, `ans` is updated to either the first character of `a` concatenated with `a[i]` (if the condition `i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]` is true) or `b[i]` (if the condition is false), `counter` remains 3, `t` remains 1, `a` remains the original input string with a length greater than 0, `b` remains the new input string, and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` remains less than or equal to the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.
