Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `work` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of the first character of `a` with subsequent characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions inside the loop, `counter` is 1, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string, and `b` is the new input string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is 0 or 1, `work` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of the first character of `a` with subsequent characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions inside the loop, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, and `a[j + 1]` is either equal to `b[j]` or not equal to `b[j]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 1, `work` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of the first character of `a` with subsequent characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions inside the loop, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, and if `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, `ans` remains unchanged; otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 2, `work` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of the first character of `a` with subsequent characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions inside the loop, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` (which is `a[3]`) is equal to `b[j]` (which is `b[2]`), then no change is made to `ans`. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
