Output State: **`i` is either 3 or 4; `ans` is `ans` + `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block explicitly mentioned, the `break` statement implies that we are exiting the context where `ans` was being updated with `ans + b[i]`. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we have exited the relevant block.
