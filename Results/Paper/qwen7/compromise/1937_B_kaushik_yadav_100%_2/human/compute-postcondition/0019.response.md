Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, `b` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `ans` is the string `a[0]` concatenated with the previous value of `ans`, `work` is set to True, `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`**
