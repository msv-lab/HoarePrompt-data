Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is equal to the length of `a` - 1, `work` is either True or False, `ans` is the first character of `a` followed by `b[1]`, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 0, `a` is the input string stripped of whitespace, `b` is the new input string stripped of whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of `b` to the string `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `ans` is updated to be the first character of `a` followed by the second character of `b` (since `b[i]` means the element at index `i` in `b`). All other variables remain unchanged.
