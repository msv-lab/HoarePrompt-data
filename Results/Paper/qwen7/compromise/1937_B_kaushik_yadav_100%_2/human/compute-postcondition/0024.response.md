Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, `b` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `ans` is the string `b[0]`, `work` is set to False.**

Explanation: The line `ans += b[i]` appends the character at index `i` of string `b` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` is updated to be the first character of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
