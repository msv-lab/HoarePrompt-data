Postcondition: **`i` is the length of string `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of characters from both strings `a` and `b` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `counter` is either 1 or 2, and `j` is 2. If `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'`, then `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
