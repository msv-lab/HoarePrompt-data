Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 5; `ans` is `ans` + `b[i-1]`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was initially 3, it becomes 4, and if `i` was initially 4, it becomes 5. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as no direct assignment to `ans` is made in the given code snippet. The expression `ans + b[i]` from the initial state is updated to `ans + b[i-1]` because `i` is now `i-1` due to the increment operation.
