Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable in the given `for` loop is `j`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < len(a) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `counter` is either 1 or 2.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `a` has more than 1 element.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `j < len(a) - 1`.
   - Given `j` is currently 1, we need to check if `1 < len(a) - 1`.

5. **Determine the new value of `j`**: Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 2.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `counter` remains unchanged (either 1 or 2).
   - `a` still has more than 1 element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2, `a` has more than 1 element**
