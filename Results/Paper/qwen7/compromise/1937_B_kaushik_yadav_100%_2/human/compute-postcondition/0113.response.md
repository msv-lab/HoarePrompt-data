Postcondition: `work` is True, `i` is either 2 or 3, `ans` is either the first character of `a` concatenated with `b[3]` or the first character of `a`, `counter` is 3, `t` is 1, and `a` is the input string with a length greater than 0, `b` is the new input string, and the character at index `i + 1` in `b` is either greater than or equal to the character at index `i + 1` in `a` or the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
