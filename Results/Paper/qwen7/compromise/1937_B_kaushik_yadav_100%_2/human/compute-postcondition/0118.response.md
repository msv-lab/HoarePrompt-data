Output State: **`work` is False, `i` is 1, `ans` is `b[0]`, `counter` is 3, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the character `b[i]` to the string `ans`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes `b[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
