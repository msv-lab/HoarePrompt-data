Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `work` is True, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of the first character of `a` with subsequent characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions inside the loop, `counter` is 2, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string, and `b` is the new input string, and `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1'.**
