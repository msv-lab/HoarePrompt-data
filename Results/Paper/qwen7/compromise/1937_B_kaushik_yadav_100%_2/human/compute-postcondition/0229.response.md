Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 5; `ans` is increased by `b[i-1]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was initially 3, it becomes 4, and if `i` was initially 4, it becomes 5. The value of `ans` is increased by `b[i]`, which is equivalent to `b[i-1]` after the increment. The initial condition that `ans` is increased by `b[i]` remains valid, but now `i` has been updated.
