Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `b` is the stripped input string from `input()`, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes `i` to 0. All other variables retain their initial states.
