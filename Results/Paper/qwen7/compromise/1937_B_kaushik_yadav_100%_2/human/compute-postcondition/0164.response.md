Postcondition: **`j` is 0 or 1, `work` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is the concatenation of the first character of `a` with subsequent characters from both `a` and `b` based on the conditions inside the loop, `counter` is either 1 or 2, `t` is 1, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, and `a[j + 1]` is either equal to `b[j]` or not equal to `b[j]`**.
