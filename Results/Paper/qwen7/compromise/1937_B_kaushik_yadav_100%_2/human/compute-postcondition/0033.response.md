Output State: **`i` is 4; `ans` is `ans` + `a[3]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing it from 3 to 4. The value of `ans` remains as `ans` + `a[3]` since no changes were made to `ans` itself within the given code snippet. The initial condition that `ans` is equal to `ans` + `a[3]` is preserved.
