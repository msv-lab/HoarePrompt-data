Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code attempts to count consecutive elements that are the same but does not address the requirement to make the array non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. Specifically, the logic does not account for the specific operation allowed to make the array non-beautiful.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the longest sequence of elements that can be made identical through the given operation and then calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break this sequence. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Find the longest segment where the condition for beauty holds
        max_beautiful_segment = 1
        current_segment = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if a[i-1] == a[i+1]:
                current_segment += 1
                max_beautiful_segment = max(max_beautiful_segment, current_segment)
            else:
                current_segment = 1
        
        # If the entire array is beautiful, it cannot be made non-beautiful
        if max_beautiful_segment == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # The minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest beautiful segment
            print(n - max_beautiful_segment)

# Example usage:
func()
```

This solution correctly identifies the longest segment where the array remains beautiful and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break this segment.
