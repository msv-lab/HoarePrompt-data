Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
2. The provided solution iterates through the array and counts the maximum number of consecutive identical elements. If the entire array consists of identical elements, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the count of the maximum segment of consecutive identical elements, which represents the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty of the array.
3. The logic in the code correctly identifies the longest segment of consecutive identical elements. However, there are a few issues:
   - The initial value of `tmp` is set to `a[0]`, but the code should reset `cnt` to 0 whenever a new sequence of different elements starts.
   - The logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It should find the minimum segment length among all segments of consecutive identical elements, rather than just the last segment.
4. The current implementation only considers the last segment of consecutive identical elements and does not account for the possibility of multiple segments with different lengths.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
