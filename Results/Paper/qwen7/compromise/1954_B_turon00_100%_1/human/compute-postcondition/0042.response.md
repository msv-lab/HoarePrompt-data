Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`**.

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `cnt` being set to 0, while `n`, `t`, `a`, and `tmp` retain their initial descriptions.
