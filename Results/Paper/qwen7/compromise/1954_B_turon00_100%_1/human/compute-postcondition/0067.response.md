Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `cnt` will be 0, `n` will be the input integer but decremented by the number of times the loop ran (which is `n`), `t` will be the initial value minus `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` will still be equal to `a[0]`, `ans` will be the minimum value between itself and `cnt` for each iteration, and `i` will be equal to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- `cnt` will reset to 0.
- `n` will be reduced to 0 since the loop runs `n` times.
- `t` will be the initial value of `t` minus `n`.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `tmp` remains `a[0]` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `ans` will hold the minimum value between itself and `cnt` for each iteration, effectively being the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`.
- `i` will be `n-1` after the last iteration.
