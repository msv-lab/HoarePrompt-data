Output State: **`cnt` is either 3, 2, or 1, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is equal to `min(ans, cnt)`**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` was either 2, 1, or 0, it now becomes 3, 2, or 1 respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
