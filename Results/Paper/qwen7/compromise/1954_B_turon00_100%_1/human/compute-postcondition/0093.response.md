Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has some value, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `tmp`, or `ans` directly. However, it sets `cnt` to 0. The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, which means `ans` is now the minimum of its original value and 0. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged if its original value was greater than or equal to 0, or it becomes 0 if its original value was less than 0. But since the exact value of `ans` before this line is not specified, we only know that `ans` is now the minimum of its original value and 0.
