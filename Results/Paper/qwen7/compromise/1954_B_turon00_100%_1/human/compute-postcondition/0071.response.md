Postcondition: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is 0, `t` is `initial_t - n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`, and `i` is `n-1`. Additionally, either `n` is not equal to 1 or `ans` is not equal to `n`**
