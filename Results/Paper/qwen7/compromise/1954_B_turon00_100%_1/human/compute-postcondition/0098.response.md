Output State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has some value, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` does not equal `tmp`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`**.

This means that after executing the line `ans = min(ans, cnt)`, the value of `ans` is updated to be the smaller of its current value and `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
