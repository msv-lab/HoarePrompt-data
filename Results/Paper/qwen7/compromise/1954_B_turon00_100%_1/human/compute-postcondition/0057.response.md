Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is equal to `min(ans, 0)`, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` sets the value of `cnt` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Since `cnt` was either 1 or 0, setting it to 0 does not change its possible values. The value of `ans` is updated to `min(ans, 0)` because `cnt` is now 0.
