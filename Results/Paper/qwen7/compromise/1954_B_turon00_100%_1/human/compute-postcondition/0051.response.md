Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is equal to `min(ans, cnt)`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `cnt`. Since `cnt` was already 0 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
