Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is either 2, 1, or 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and greater than 0.
   - `t` is decreased by 1 (this is not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input (not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `tmp` is equal to `a[0]` (not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `ans` is equal to `min(ans, cnt)` (not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The value of `i` will increase by 1. Since `i` was either 1 or 2, it will become 2 or 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Since `n` is greater than 0, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `cnt` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop head.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop head.
- `i` increases by 1, so if `i` was 1, it becomes 2; if `i` was 2, it becomes 3.
- `t`, `a`, `tmp`, and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`cnt` is either 2, 1, or 0, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0, `i` is either 2 or 3, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is equal to `min(ans, cnt)**.
