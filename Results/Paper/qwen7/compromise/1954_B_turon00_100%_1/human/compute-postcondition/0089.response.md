Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has some value, and either `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`, or `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` does not equal `tmp`.
