Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has some value, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` regardless of whether the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp` or not.
