Output State: **`ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop's execution, `cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = a[0]` assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
