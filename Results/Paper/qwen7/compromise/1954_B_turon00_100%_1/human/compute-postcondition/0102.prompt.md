Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `initial_t - n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, `ans` is the maximum sequence length of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]` found in the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input, `tmp` is now `a[0]`, `ans` is `n`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == tmp:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        cnt = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has some value, and either `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`, or `cnt` remains 0 and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` does not equal `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has some value, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` does not equal `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `tmp` has some value, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the element at index `i` in list `a` equals `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` remains unchanged, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` if the element at index `i` in list `a` does not equal `tmp`, and `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
