Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the loop head; it will be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is set to 0 at the start of the loop, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `t`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are related to `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
