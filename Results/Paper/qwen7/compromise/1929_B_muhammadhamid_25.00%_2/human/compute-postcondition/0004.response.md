Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it prints one of three possible values based on the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \): 1, \(\lceil k / 2 \rceil\), or \( k // 2 + 1 \). If \( k \) equals 1, it prints 1. If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2n \), it prints \(\lceil k / 2 \rceil\). Otherwise, it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \). The function does not return any value but outputs these results for each test case.**
