Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each containing either "1", or a value calculated based on the inputs \(n\) and \(k\). Specifically, for each test case:
- If \(k = 1\), the output is "1".
- If \(k \leq 2n\), the output is \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\).
- If \(k > 2n\), the output is \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\).

The number of lines in the output state is equal to the number of test cases specified by the first input.
