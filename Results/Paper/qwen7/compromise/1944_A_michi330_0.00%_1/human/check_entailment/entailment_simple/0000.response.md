Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most \( k \) bridges. The program correctly handles the logic for different values of \( k \):

1. If \( k \geq n - 1 \), destroying \( k \) bridges would leave at most one island reachable from island 1 (Everule's starting point). This is because each island is initially connected to every other island, so destroying \( n - 1 \) bridges would isolate island 1 from all others. Any additional bridges destroyed beyond \( n - 1 \) would not change this outcome since the graph would already be disconnected.

2. If \( k < n - 1 \), Everule can still visit more than one island. In the worst-case scenario for Dominater, they would try to isolate island 1 by destroying bridges connecting it to other islands. However, even with \( k \) bridges destroyed, there will always be at least one path from island 1 to another island, ensuring that Everule can visit at least two islands (island 1 and one other).

The program correctly implements this logic:
- It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
- It checks if \( k \geq n - 1 \). If true, it prints 1, indicating that only island 1 is reachable.
- Otherwise, it prints \( n - 1 \), indicating that all other islands can still be reached from island 1.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly.

Correctness: **True**
