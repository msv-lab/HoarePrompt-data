Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

3. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cnt` is increased by the floor division of `x` by 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is being taken from the list `a` in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `x` would have been the last element processed from `a`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must still contain at least one element.
   - `cnt` will be increased by the floor division of the new value of `x` by 2.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` must still be a list of integers, but it should now be missing the last element that was processed.
   - `cnt` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element less than the previous `x`, `cnt` is increased by the floor division of the new `x` by 2**
