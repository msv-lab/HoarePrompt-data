Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is the second element of `a`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `cnt` is 3 plus the floor division of `x` by 2.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Determine the changes in the loop head variables**:
   - Since `x` is the second element of `a`, the loop will iterate over each element of `a`.
   - After the first iteration, `x` becomes the third element of `a` (since it was the second element before moving to the next).
   - The list `a` itself does not change; it remains the same list.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `x` will now be the third element of `a`.
   - `a` remains the same list as before.

5. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `cnt` and `t` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`x` is the third element of `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is 3 plus the floor division of `x` by 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
