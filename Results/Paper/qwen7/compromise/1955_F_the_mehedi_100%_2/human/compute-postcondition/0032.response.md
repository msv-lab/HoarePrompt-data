Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (an underscore) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `x` is the first element of `a`.
   - `cnt` is 9.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will take an input from the user using `int(input())`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the input must be a positive integer.
   - Since `t` was a positive integer at the end of the previous iteration, it is reasonable to assume that the next input will also be a positive integer (as per the problem constraints).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `a` remains a non-empty list.
   - `x` remains the first element of `a`.
   - `cnt` remains 9.
   - `t` is updated to the new positive integer input.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the first element of `a`, `cnt` is 9, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

However, since the value of `t` changes with each iteration, we need to reflect that change. Therefore, the updated state should include the new value of `t`:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the first element of `a`, `cnt` is 9, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and the new value of `t` is the positive integer input from the user.**
