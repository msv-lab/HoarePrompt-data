Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as the input value is a positive integer. Since `t` is given to be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute as long as the input value is within this range.

3. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that the input value meets the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to set the input value to a valid positive integer within the specified range.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, which should be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
