The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, a)` to compute a result and stores these results in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result from the list. The function does not return any value directly but modifies a list (`results`) and prints the computed results.
