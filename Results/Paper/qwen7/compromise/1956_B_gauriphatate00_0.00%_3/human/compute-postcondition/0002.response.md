Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input on whitespace, `idx` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `idx` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial states.
