Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input on whitespace, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `data`, or `idx`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `results` is added as a new variable with an initial value of an empty list.
