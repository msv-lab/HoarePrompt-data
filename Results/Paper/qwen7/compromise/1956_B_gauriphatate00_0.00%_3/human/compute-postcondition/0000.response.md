Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the list is read from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`, which changes how input is read. Instead of reading input line by line, it reads the entire input as a single string. However, the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that each integer from 1 through n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5 is still valid.
