Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves two players, you and Nene, playing a card game where the goal is to maximize points by matching cards on the table. Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each player starts with \( n \) cards.
   - Each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly twice among the 2n cards.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(n, a)**: This function calculates the number of pairs of identical cards in your hand (`pairs`). It also returns the minimum value between the number of such pairs and \( n // 2 \).
     - **Counter(a)**: Counts occurrences of each card.
     - **sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2)**: Counts how many numbers appear exactly twice.
     - **min(pairs, n // 2)**: Ensures that the number of points you can get is limited by either the number of pairs or half the number of your cards.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Since Nene always plays optimally, she will try to prevent you from scoring points by placing her cards strategically.
   - If you have more than \( n // 2 \) pairs, Nene can force you to lose some points by playing against your pairs.
   - Therefore, the function correctly calculates the maximum points you can get by considering the optimal play of Nene.

5. **Program Flow**:
   - **func_2()**: Reads input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1(n, a)` for each test case.
   - The program reads input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

Given the analysis, the logic in `func_1` accurately reflects the optimal strategy for maximizing your score while considering Nene's optimal play. The overall structure of the program is correct and handles the problem as specified.

Correctness: **True**
