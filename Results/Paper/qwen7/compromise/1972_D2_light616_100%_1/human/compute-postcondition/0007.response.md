Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and t equals 1 after all iterations of the loop have been executed, and func_1() has been called t times.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be equal to 1 (since it starts between 1 and 10^4 and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 1), and the function `func_1()` will have been called exactly `t` times, which is the final value of `t` (1 in this case).
