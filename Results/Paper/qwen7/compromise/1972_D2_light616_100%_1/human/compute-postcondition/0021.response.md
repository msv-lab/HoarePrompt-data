Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x * x <= n`.
2. **Current values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is 2
   - `y` is 5
   - `n` is at least 5
   - `m` is at least 20

3. **Determine if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `x * x <= n` must be true.
   - Currently, `x = 2`, so `x * x = 4`.
   - Since `n` is at least 5, `4 <= n` is always true.

Given that `x * x` is 4 and `n` is at least 5, the condition `x * x <= n` will always be true regardless of the exact value of `n` (as long as it is at least 5).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variables involved in the loop condition are `x` and `n`.
   - Since `x` is fixed at 2, no adjustment is needed for `x`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `n` must still satisfy the condition `x * x <= n`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` remains at least 5.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 5, `n` is at least 5, `m` is at least 20**
