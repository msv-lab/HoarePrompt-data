Output State: `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, `n` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `costs`. The first element of `costs` is `n - k + 1` and the second is `1`. In each iteration, `curr` is set to `n` divided by the current element in `costs`, then `h` is incremented by `curr`, and `n` is decreased by `i * curr`. After the first iteration (`i = n - k + 1`), `n` becomes 0 because `n // (n - k + 1)` will be at most 1 (if `n` is just slightly larger than `k-1`) and subtracting `(n - k + 1) * 1` from `n` will make it zero. In the second iteration (`i = 1`), `curr` will be `n // 1`, which is 0 since `n` is now 0, so no changes are made to `h` or `n`. Therefore, `h` becomes the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, and `n` remains 0.
