Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Evaluate `h`:**
   - Since `n` is 0, let's evaluate the expression for `h`:
     - `n // (n - k + 1)`: This is `0 // (0 - k + 1)`, which simplifies to `0 // (-k + 1)`. 
       - If `k > 1`, then `-k + 1` is negative, and `0 // (-k + 1)` results in `0` because division of 0 by any non-zero number (especially a negative one) results in 0.
       - If `k = 1`, then `-k + 1` is 0, and `0 // 0` is undefined in Python, but typically treated as 0 in such contexts.
     - `n // 1`: This is `0 // 1`, which is simply `0`.
   - Therefore, `h` is `0 + 0 = 0`.

3. **Check `h` and `k`:**
   - Given that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, and since `h` is 0, `k` must be 0 or a negative number (since `k` cannot be positive if `h` is 0).

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(*costs)`.
   - However, there is no definition or initialization of the `costs` variable in the given initial state.

Given the above analysis, since `costs` is not defined or initialized, the print statement will raise a `NameError` because `costs` is not a defined variable.

**Final Output:**
Output: **NameError: name 'costs' is not defined**
