### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function summary against the problem description and the examples given.

#### Problem Description:
- Alice has `n` coins.
- Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she runs out of coins or reaches the last stall.

#### Given Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        h += curr
        n -= i * curr
    if h < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(*costs)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` takes two parameters `n` and `k`.
- If `n == k`, it prints 'YES', 1, and 1, then returns `k`.
- If `n < k`, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`.
- Otherwise, it calculates the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, stores these values in `h` and `n`, respectively, and prints 'YES', 2, and the values of `costs`. It returns `None` if `h < k`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Handling `n == k`:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == k` by printing 'YES', 1, and 1, which means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by buying one jewel from one stall.
   
2. **Handling `n < k`:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if `n < k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels and prints 'NO'.

3. **Handling `n >= k`:**
   - The program attempts to set up at most 2 stalls and determine the prices for these stalls.
   - It calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall using integer division.
   - However, this approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. For example, consider the test case `255 8`:
     - The program calculates `costs = [254, 1]`.
     - Alice buys 1 jewel from the first stall (254 coins / 254 coins = 1 jewel) and 1 jewel from the second stall (1 coin / 1 coin = 1 jewel), totaling 2 jewels.
     - This is incorrect because the expected output is to set up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]` to ensure Alice buys exactly 8 jewels.

4. **General Case:**
   - The program does not handle the general case where more than 2 stalls are needed. It always attempts to set up at most 2 stalls, which is insufficient for some cases.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to handle scenarios where more than 2 stalls are needed and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the scenario where more than 2 stalls are needed and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
