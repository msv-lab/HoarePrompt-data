### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires setting up stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from each stall in sequence until she cannot afford any more jewels in the next stall.
   - The program should be able to handle any number of stalls up to 60 and determine if it's possible to achieve exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is defined to handle the logic for determining if it's possible to achieve `k` jewels.
   - The function only considers the simplest scenario of using 2 stalls, which might not always be sufficient.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", 1, and 1. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins and each jewel costs 1 coin, she can buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This is also correct because if Alice has fewer coins than needed to buy even one jewel, it's impossible.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost array `costs` and checks if the sum of the number of jewels Alice can buy from these stalls is at least `k`. If so, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls and the cost array. If not, it prints "NO".
   - The logic to determine if it's possible to achieve `k` jewels with 2 stalls is correct, but it doesn't explore other potential solutions involving more stalls.

4. **Stall Setup and Pricing**:
   - The program attempts to use only 2 stalls, which might not always be sufficient. However, the problem statement allows for up to 60 stalls, but the solution only uses 2 stalls.
   - The logic to determine if it's possible to achieve `k` jewels with 2 stalls is correct, but it doesn't explore other potential solutions involving more stalls.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the basic cases correctly but does not cover all edge cases, especially when more than 2 stalls are needed. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is close to `n`, the program might fail to find a solution with just 2 stalls.
   - The program does not consider scenarios where more than 2 stalls are necessary to achieve exactly `k` jewels.

### Evaluation Based on Annotated Code:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - The program prints "YES", 1, and 1. This is correct because Alice can buy 3 jewels by buying 1 jewel from the first stall and 2 jewels from the second stall.
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 6`, `k = 4`
  - The program prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy 4 jewels with only 6 coins.
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 255`, `k = 8`
  - The program prints "YES", 8, and the cost array `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`. This is correct because Alice can buy 8 jewels by buying 1 jewel from each stall.

### Conclusion:

The program is partially correct but incomplete. It only considers the simplest scenario of using 2 stalls and does not explore other potential solutions involving more stalls. However, the provided examples in the annotated code show that the program correctly handles the cases where 2 stalls are sufficient.

Given the constraints and the examples provided, the program is correct for the given test cases, but it may fail for more complex scenarios where more than 2 stalls are needed.

**Final: False**

The program is not fully correct according to the problem statement, but it passes the provided test cases. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate.
