Output State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `m`. The values of `ma` and `mi` remain unchanged as they were initially set to 0. The variable `t` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `m` as an input integer, while keeping the initial values of `ma`, `mi`, and the description of `t`.
