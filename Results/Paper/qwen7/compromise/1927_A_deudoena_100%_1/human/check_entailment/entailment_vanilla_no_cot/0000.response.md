Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white. The logic in the function `func_1` only considers the first and last black cells but does not account for the possibility of multiple segments of black cells that need to be considered together.

To fix this, the program should find the longest sequence of consecutive white cells and then calculate the length of the segment needed to cover any remaining black cells. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    # Find the longest sequence of consecutive white cells
    max_white_sequence = 0
    current_white_sequence = 0
    for j in s:
        if j == 'W':
            current_white_sequence += 1
        else:
            max_white_sequence = max(max_white_sequence, current_white_sequence)
            current_white_sequence = 0
    max_white_sequence = max(max_white_sequence, current_white_sequence)
    
    # Calculate the minimum segment length to make all cells white
    min_segment_length = m - max_white_sequence
    return min_segment_length + 1
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.
