You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `c` is the length of `s`, `d` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `l` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop increments `c` for each character in the string `s`. If the character 'B' is encountered, `mi` is set to the current value of `c` and the loop breaks. Since no specific values for `s` are given, `c` will be the length of `s` after the loop completes, assuming 'B' was not found or the loop did not break. The variables `ma`, `d`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `ma` is the distance from the end of the string `s` where the character 'B' is found, `mi` is 0, `c` is the length of `s`, `d` is the number of characters processed before finding 'B', `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `l` is an empty list.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the distance from the end of the string `s` where the character 'B' is found, which is `ma`, minus 0 (the value of `mi`), plus 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a string `s` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'. It calculates the distance from the end of the string to the last occurrence of 'B' and returns this distance plus 2. The function does not accept any parameters and reads `m` and `s` from input.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. Specifically, the program calculates `ma - mi + 2`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that the segment might start from the beginning or end of the string.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
WBBWBW
```
The correct output should be 4, as explained in the problem statement. However, the program incorrectly outputs 6 because it calculates `ma - mi + 2` without considering the actual positions of the black cells.

To fix this, the program should find the first and last positions of the black cells and calculate the distance between them plus one (since the segment includes both endpoints). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    start = None
    end = None
    for j in range(m):
        if s[j] == 'B':
            if start is None:
                start = j + 1
            end = j + 1
    if start is None:
        return 0  # All cells are already white
    return end - start + 1
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the minimum length of the segment needed to make all cells white.
