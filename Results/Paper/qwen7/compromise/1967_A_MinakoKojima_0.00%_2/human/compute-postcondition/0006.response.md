Output State: **`ans` is the factorial of `n`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` to be the factorial of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `m` are preserved, and `ans` now holds the factorial of `n`.
