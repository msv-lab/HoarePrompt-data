Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `m` is the minimum value in list `a`, `ans` is updated to its current value multiplied by the difference between each consecutive element in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, `a` is now a list of integers from the input split and converted.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input as a string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state, with the addition that `a` is now updated to the list of integers obtained from the input.
