Postcondition: `ans` is the product of differences between consecutive elements from `a[1]` to `a[n-1]`, and `i` is equal to `n`. This means that if `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, `ans` is calculated as the product of differences between consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `i` is equal to `n`.
