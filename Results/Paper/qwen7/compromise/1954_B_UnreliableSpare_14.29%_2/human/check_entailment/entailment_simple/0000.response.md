Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
2. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
3. The given solution attempts to solve this by checking if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same), and if not, finding the smallest segment of non-uniform elements.
4. The code initializes `flag` to check if the array is already uniform. If it is, it prints `-1`.
5. If the array is not uniform, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.
6. The logic in the code seems flawed because it incorrectly assumes that the array can only be broken by removing elements that are not equal to the first element (`arr[0]`). This is not a general solution to breaking the beauty condition.
7. The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0 and never updated correctly to reflect the length of segments of non-uniform elements. Therefore, the final value of `ans` will always be 0, which is incorrect.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
