### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Array Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Non-Beautiful**:
   - The program checks if the array is already non-beautiful by verifying if all elements are the same. This is done using the `flag` variable.
   - If all elements are the same (`flag` remains `True`), the program prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to a very large value (`Decimal('Infinity')`) to keep track of the minimum number of removals needed.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive occurrences of the same element.
   - For each change in the value, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive occurrences found so far.

4. **Output**:
   - If the array was initially beautiful (`flag` is `True`), the program correctly outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum number of removals needed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Analysis:
- The logic for checking if the array is already non-beautiful is correct.
- The method to find the minimum number of removals is also correct. It correctly identifies the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and uses this to determine the minimum number of removals needed.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
