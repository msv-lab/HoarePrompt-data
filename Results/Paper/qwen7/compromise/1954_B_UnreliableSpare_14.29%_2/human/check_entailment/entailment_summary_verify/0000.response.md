### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given test cases.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` processes an array `arr` to find the minimum length of consecutive segments where all elements are the same as the first element of the array.
- If the array is not constant (i.e., contains at least one element different from the first), it prints the minimum segment length.
- If the array is constant, it prints `-1`.
- The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
- The array is considered beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

#### Test Case Analysis:
1. **Test Case 1:**
   ```
   3
   1 2 1
   ```
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing the element at index 2 (value 1) makes the array `[1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   ```
   5
   1 2 1 2 1
   ```
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Removing the element at index 5 (value 1) makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   ```
   1
   1
   ```
   - Expected Output: `-1`
   - Explanation: The array is already constant and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing any elements.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   ```
   7
   3 3 3 5 3 3 3
   ```
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: Removing the first three elements (values 3) makes the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1`.
- In `func_1`, it first checks if the array is constant by comparing each element with the first element.
- If the array is not constant, it calculates the minimum length of consecutive identical segments and prints that as the result.
- If the array is constant, it prints `-1`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly identifies when the array is constant and prints `-1` in such cases.
- For arrays that are not constant, the program calculates the minimum length of consecutive identical segments, which is a valid approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

Given the analysis, the program correctly handles the problem statement and the provided test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.
