Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
- The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
  - The function `func_1()` incorrectly assumes that the array is not beautiful if there is at least one element different from the first element. This is not sufficient to determine if the array can become non-beautiful.
  - The logic for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It only considers consecutive segments where elements are the same as the first element, which does not cover all possible ways to make the array non-beautiful.
  - The program does not handle the correct logic for identifying and counting the necessary removals to break the beauty condition.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
