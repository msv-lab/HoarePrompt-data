Functionality: **The function processes an array `arr` to find the minimum length of consecutive segments where all elements are the same as the first element of the array. If the array is not constant (i.e., contains at least one element different from the first), it prints the minimum segment length; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.**
