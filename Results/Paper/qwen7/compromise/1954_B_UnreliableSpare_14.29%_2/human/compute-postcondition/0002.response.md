Output State: **`flag` is True, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer, and arr is a list of n integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The line `flag = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `flag`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `flag` set to `True`.
