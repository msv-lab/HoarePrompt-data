Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`, and `F` is a non-empty iterable.**

Explanation: The code `l = bisect_right(D, left - f)` uses the `bisect_right` function to find the index of the first element in the iterable `D` that is strictly greater than `left - f`. This operation does not affect the value of `F`, so it remains a non-empty iterable. The value of `l` is set to the index found by the `bisect_right` function.
