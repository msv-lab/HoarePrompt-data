Output State: **`i` is 6, `diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`, `max_diff` is equal to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`**.

Explanation: The code `max_diff = diff` updates the value of `max_diff` to be equal to the current value of `diff`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `diff` is defined as `A[i] - A[i - 1]` and `i` is 6, `diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`. Therefore, `max_diff` is now also `A[6] - A[5]`, and `next_max_diff` remains equal to `max_diff`.
