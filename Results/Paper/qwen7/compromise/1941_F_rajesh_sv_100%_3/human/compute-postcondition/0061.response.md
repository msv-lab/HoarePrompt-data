Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` must be greater than `l`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to `mid + 1`. The other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, `h`, and `l` being related to the condition `l` must be less than `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
