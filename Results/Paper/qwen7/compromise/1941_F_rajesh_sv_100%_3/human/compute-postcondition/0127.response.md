To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head conditions and see how they change from one iteration to the next.

Given the loop:
```python
while l < h:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop continues as long as `l < h`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `total` is 0
- `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`

The decision to continue the loop is based on the condition `l < h`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is ensuring that `l < h` remains true.

Since the loop condition `l < h` is already satisfied at the end of the previous iteration, no adjustments are necessary to maintain this condition for the next iteration.

State: **`total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`**
