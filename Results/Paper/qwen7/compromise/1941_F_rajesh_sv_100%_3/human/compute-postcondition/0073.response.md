Postcondition: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`. `l` is the greatest index such that `D[l] + f` is less than or equal to `right`, and `h` is the smallest index such that `D[h] + f` is greater than `right`. The loop has narrowed down the range, and now `l` equals `h`, meaning the exact index where `D[l] + f` is just less than or equal to `right` has been found.**
