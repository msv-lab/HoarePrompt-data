Output State: **`total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is `mid`.**

Explanation: The variable `h` is assigned the value of `mid`. All other variables (`total`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
