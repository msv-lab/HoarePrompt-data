Output State: `testcases` must be greater than 2.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `testcases` must be greater than 2. This is because the loop continues to execute as long as `testcases` is greater than 0, and it specifically mentions that after 3 iterations, `testcases` must be greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to complete all its iterations, `testcases` must initially be greater than 2.
