Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is less than `mid`, `h` is `mid`, `ans` is set based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`**

Explanation: The code does not change the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`. It also does not affect the values of `l`, `h`, `ans`, or `mid` directly. Instead, it reassigns `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to the same expressions they already had (`D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `mid`, which is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`. All other variables retain their previous states.
