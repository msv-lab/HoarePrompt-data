Output State: **`total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` and `h` are equal to each other, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f**.

Explanation: The code does not change the values of `total`, `l`, `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, or `mid_next_sum`. Instead, it reassigns `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to the same expressions they were already equal to (`D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
