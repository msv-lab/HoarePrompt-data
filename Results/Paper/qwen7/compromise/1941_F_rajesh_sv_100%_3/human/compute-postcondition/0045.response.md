Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `f` and the iterable `F`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `f` is the variable that will take each element from the iterable `F` one by one.
   - `F` is an iterable (list, tuple, etc.) containing elements.

3. **Initial Values Before the Loop Starts**:
   - `max_diff` is the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A` from index 1 to `n-1`.
   - `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found under the same conditions.
   - `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `diff` is the last calculated difference which is `A[n-1] - A[n-2]`.
   - `left` is `A[index - 1]`.
   - `right` is `A[index]`.
   - `ans` is `max_diff`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The loop will start executing when `f` takes its first value from the iterable `F`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `F` is non-empty so that the loop can start.

5. **Final State**:
   - We need to ensure that `F` is not empty, as the loop requires at least one element to iterate over.

State: **`F` must be a non-empty iterable**
