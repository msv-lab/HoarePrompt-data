Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is less than `mid`, `h` is `mid`, `ans` is set based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is now `mid`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `h` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
