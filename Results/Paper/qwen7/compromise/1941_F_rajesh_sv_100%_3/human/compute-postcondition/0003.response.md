The only object in the loop head is the variable `testcases`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `testcases`. At the end of the last iteration, `testcases` must be a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `testcases` must be greater than 0.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0**
