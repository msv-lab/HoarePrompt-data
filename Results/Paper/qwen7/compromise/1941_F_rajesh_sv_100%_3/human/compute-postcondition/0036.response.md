Output State: **`i` is 6, `diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`, `max_diff` remains unchanged, `next_max_diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`**

Explanation: The code sets `next_max_diff` to the value of `diff`. Given that `diff` is defined as `A[i] - A[i - 1]` and `i` is 6, `diff` becomes `A[6] - A[5]`. The values of `max_diff` and `next_max_diff` are updated accordingly, while `i` and `diff` retain their original expressions.
