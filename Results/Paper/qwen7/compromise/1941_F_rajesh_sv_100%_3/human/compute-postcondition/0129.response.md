Output State: **`total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation: The code does not change the values of `total`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, or `mid_next_sum`. It simply reassigns `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to the same expressions they already held. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
