Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `eta_ln` must be greater than 1
   - `j` is 2
   - `res` is increased by `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` and then further increased by `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`
   - `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, eta_ln):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `eta_ln - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 3.
   - Since `eta_ln` must be greater than 1, it remains unchanged.

4. **Updating `res` and `rho`:**
   - The value of `res` is updated based on the values of `eta[1]` and `eta[2]`.
   - The value of `rho` is updated based on the current value of `eta[j]`.

5. **New Values for the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` will be 3.
   - `eta_ln` remains the same.
   - `res` will be updated by adding `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho` (since `j` was 2 in the previous iteration).
   - `rho` will be updated by adding `q[eta[3]]` (if `eta[3]` exists).

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `eta_ln` must be greater than 1
- `j` is 3
- `res` is increased by `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`
- `rho` is increased by `q[eta[3]]` (if `eta[3]` exists)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`eta_ln` must be greater than 1, `j` is 3, `res` is increased by `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[3]]` if `eta[3]` exists**
