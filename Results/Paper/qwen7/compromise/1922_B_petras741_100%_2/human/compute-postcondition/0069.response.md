Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the constant `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The initial value of `j` is given as `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. Given that `j` starts at `n - 1`, the loop will run for `n` iterations.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `j` must iterate through all values from `0` to `n - 1`. Since `j` starts at `n - 1`, it will cover all necessary values if the loop runs correctly.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `j` starts at the correct initial value (`n - 1`) and that `n` is greater than 0 (as given).

Given these points, the only states that need adjustment are `j` and `n`.

### Final State Adjustment:
- `j` should be `n - 1`.
- `n` should be greater than 0.

Since the problem specifies that `n` is already greater than 0, we only need to ensure that `j` is set correctly.

### Final Answer:
State: **`j` is `n - 1`**
