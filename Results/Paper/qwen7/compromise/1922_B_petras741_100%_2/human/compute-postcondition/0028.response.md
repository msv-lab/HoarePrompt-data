Output State: **`eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to n, inclusive, provided that `q[j] > 0` for each `j` from 0 to n.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `eta` will contain every integer from 0 up to and including `n`, but only if the corresponding value in the list `q` is greater than 0. If any `q[j]` is not greater than 0, then `j` will not be added to `eta`. The final state of `eta` will depend on the values in `q` for each index from 0 to `n`.
