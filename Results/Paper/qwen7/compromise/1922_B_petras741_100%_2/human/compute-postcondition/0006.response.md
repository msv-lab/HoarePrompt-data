Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `q` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `buffer`, `i`, `n`, and `w` remain unchanged from their initial states.
