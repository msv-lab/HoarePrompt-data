Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `j` and the condition `range(n)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `w` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `t` is an input integer (though `t` is not involved in the loop).
   - `j` is 4.
   - `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.
   - `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1.
   - `q[w[4]]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be 5.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` is 5.
- `n` remains the same as before.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`w` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `j` is 5, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1, `q[w[4]]` is incremented by 1**
