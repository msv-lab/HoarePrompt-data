Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable is `j`, and the condition for the loop is `j < eta_ln`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `eta_ln` must be at least 2
   - `res` has been updated based on some calculations involving `q[eta[1]]`, `q[eta[2]]`, and `rho`
   - `rho` has been updated based on `q[eta[j]]`

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**: Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be 3.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `eta_ln`. Given that `j` is now 3, `eta_ln` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be 3
   - `eta_ln` must be greater than 3
   - `res` and `rho` remain unchanged as they are not directly modified by the loop increment but by the loop body, which is omitted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 3, `eta_ln` must be greater than 3, `res` is increased by `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6` and then by `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[2]]`**
