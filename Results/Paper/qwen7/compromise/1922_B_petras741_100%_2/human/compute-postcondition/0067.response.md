Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 0; each `q[w[j]]` for `j` in the range of `n` will be incremented by 1 for the corresponding index `w[j]` in the list `w`.

This means that after the loop completes, the list `q` will contain the count of how many times each integer from the list `w` appears. The variable `j` will have the value `n-1`, indicating the last iteration of the loop.
