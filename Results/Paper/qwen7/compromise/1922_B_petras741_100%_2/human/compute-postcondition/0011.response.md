Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `j in range(n)`. This means the only variable directly controlled by the loop is `j`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.
   - `j` is updated to `j + 1`.
   - `j + 1` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `j < n` must still hold true.

Given the current state:
- `q[w[j]]` has already been incremented.
- `j` is now `j + 1`.
- We need to ensure that `j + 1 < n` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these adjustments.

**State: **`q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `j` is `j + 1`, and `j + 1` is less than `n`**
