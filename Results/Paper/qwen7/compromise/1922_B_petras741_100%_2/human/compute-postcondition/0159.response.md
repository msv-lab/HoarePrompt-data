Output State: **`rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `j` is `n + 3` and must be less than `eta_ln`, `eta` contains all indices `i` from `0` to `n` where `q[i]` was greater than `0` during the loop's execution, `res` is `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]]) + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]]) + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * (`q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]]'), `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]]` to its original value.**

Explanation: The value of `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]]` to its original value, which was `q[eta[0]] + q[eta[j]] + q[eta[j]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
