Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `y` is `-1`, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, `rem` is 0**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 2.
- `y` is calculated as `n - 2 - i`. Since `i` is 2, `y` becomes `n - 4`.
- `k` is updated to 0.
- `r` is calculated as `a[2] + k // 3`. Since `k` is now 0, `r` simplifies to `a[2]`.
- `rem` is calculated as `k % 3`. Since `k` is 0, `rem` is 0.

Therefore, after executing `k = 0`, the values of the variables are updated accordingly.
