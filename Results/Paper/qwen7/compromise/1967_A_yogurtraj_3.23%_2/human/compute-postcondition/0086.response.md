Output State: **i is 7, n is greater than 8, k is 0, r is a[7], rem is 0, y is n - 3, ii is 0.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will increment by 1 for each iteration until it reaches `n-1`. Since the loop starts with `i` as 3 and increments by 1 each time, after `n-1` iterations, `i` will be `n-1`. Given that the loop runs until `i` is `n-1`, if `n` is greater than 8, `i` will be 7. The variable `k` is set to 0 when the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is met inside the loop, and since the loop continues to decrement `k` otherwise, eventually `k` will become 0. The value of `r` will be the last element of the list `a` that satisfies the condition or will be `a[n-2]` if no such element is found, which in this case is `a[7]`. The variable `rem` is always set to 0, and `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`, which becomes `n - 3` when `i` is 7. Lastly, `ii` is not affected by the loop and remains 0.
