Output State: **`i` is 3, `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`, `rem` is `k % 4`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, which is `4`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `3`, and the value of `r` remains unchanged as `a[3] + k // 4`. The new variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k % 4`.
