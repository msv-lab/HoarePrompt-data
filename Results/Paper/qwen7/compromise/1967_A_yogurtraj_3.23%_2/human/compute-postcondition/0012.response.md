Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers where the second element minus the first element is greater than 0, `r` is 0, `rem` is `k % 1`, `y` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables retain their previous values. Specifically, `r` is updated to `0` since `r` was previously `a[0] + k // 1`, and now `k` is `0`. The value of `rem` remains unchanged as it is dependent on the original value of `k`, which is now `0`.
