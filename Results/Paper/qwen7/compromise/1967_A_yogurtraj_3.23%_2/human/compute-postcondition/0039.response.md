Output State: **i is 3, n is greater than 1, k is 0, r is a[3], rem is 0, y is -1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will increment to `n-1` which is `3` in this case. The condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` will no longer be checked since the loop has completed. Therefore, `k` will be 0, and `r` will be set to `a[i + 1]` which is `a[3]`. The variable `rem` will also be 0 as it is reset to 0 when `k` is set to 0 inside the loop. The variable `y` is set to `-1` when the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is met for the last iteration, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
