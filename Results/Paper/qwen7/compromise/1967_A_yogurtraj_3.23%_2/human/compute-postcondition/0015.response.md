Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which simplifies to `2 * (a[2] - a[1])` since `i` is now 1. The initial conditions that `n` is greater than 1 and `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]))` is less than or equal to `k` remain valid, but they are not directly affecting the output state.
