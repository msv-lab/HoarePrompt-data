Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `y` is -1, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, `rem` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
