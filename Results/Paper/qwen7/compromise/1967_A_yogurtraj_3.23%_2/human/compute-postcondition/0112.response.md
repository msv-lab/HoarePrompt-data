Postcondition: `i` is 7, `r` is `a[8]`, and `k` is adjusted based on the following conditions: if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` remains unchanged and `r` is set to `a[8] + 0 // 8` with `rem` being `0 % 9` and `y` is `n - 8` with the most internal loop or if statement broken out. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and `r` is set to `a[8]`.
