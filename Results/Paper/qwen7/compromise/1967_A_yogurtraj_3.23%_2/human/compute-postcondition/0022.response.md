Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is `n - 2`**.

This means that the value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, `n` is still greater than 1, `r` retains its value as `a[1] + k // 2`, `rem` stays as `k % 2`, and `y` is now calculated as `n - 1 - i`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.
