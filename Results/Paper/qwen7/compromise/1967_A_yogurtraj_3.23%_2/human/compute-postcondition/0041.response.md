Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is not 0, `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`, `rem` is 0, `y` is -1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r` to `a[n-1] + k // n`. Since `n` is greater than 1, `n-1` will be a valid index for list `a`. The value of `r` is now the sum of the element at index `n-1` of list `a` and the integer division of `k` by `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
