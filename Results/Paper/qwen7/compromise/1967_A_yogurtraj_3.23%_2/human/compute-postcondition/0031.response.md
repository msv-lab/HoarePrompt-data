Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is updated based on the new value of `i`, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `rem` is `k % 3`, `y` is not specified as it is not used in the else part.**

Explanation: The code calculates `rem` as `k % (i + 1)`, which means `rem` is now `k % 3`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `r`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
