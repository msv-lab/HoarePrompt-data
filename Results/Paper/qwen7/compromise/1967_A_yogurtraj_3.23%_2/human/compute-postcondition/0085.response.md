Postcondition: `i` is 5, `n` is greater than 6, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`. If the condition is true, then `r` is `a[5] + 0 // 6`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the condition is false, then `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is `a[6]`.
