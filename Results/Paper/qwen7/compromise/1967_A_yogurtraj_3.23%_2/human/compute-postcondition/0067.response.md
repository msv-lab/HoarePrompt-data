Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is at least 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. This means `i` should increment from 0 up to `n-1`.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - The loop will continue if `i < n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 4 (since `i` needs to be incremented to 4).

5. **Update the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 4.
   - `n` must remain at least 5 (since `i` is now 4 and the loop condition requires `i < n - 1`).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop are:

- `i` will be 4.
- `n` must be at least 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 4, `n` is at least 5**
