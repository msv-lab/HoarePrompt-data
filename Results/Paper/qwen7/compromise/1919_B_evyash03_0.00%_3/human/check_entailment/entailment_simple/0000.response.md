Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array represented by the string `expression`.
2. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. Specifically, it counts the number of times the balance (sum of the array elements) becomes negative, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum penalty.
3. The function `func_1` does not consider the actual penalty calculation as described in the problem statement, which involves calculating the absolute value of the sum of each segment multiplied by its length.
4. The provided code only counts the number of segments where the balance becomes negative and adds one if the final balance is positive. This does not account for the actual penalty calculation as required by the problem.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
