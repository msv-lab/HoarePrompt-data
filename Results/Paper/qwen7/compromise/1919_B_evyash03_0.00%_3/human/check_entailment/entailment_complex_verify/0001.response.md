### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program aims to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array into non-empty segments where the sum of each segment is non-negative. However, let's carefully verify the logic and behavior of the program to ensure it meets the requirements.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `expression`.

2. **Splitting the String:**
   - The string `expression` is split into parts using `'-'` as the delimiter. This means that each part between `'-'` characters is considered a contiguous segment of `'+ '` characters.
   - `parts = expression.split('-')` results in a list of segments where each segment consists only of `'+ '` characters.

3. **Calculating Result Length:**
   - `result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))` calculates the total length of these segments. This is equivalent to counting the number of `'+ '` characters in the original string.

4. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - The program calls `func_1(expression, result_length)` with the original string and the calculated result length.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - It maintains a `balance` variable which tracks the net effect of `'+ '` and `'-'` characters.
   - If at any point `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` and resets `balance` to zero.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`, which effectively counts the number of segments needed to split the array into non-empty segments where the sum of each segment is non-negative.

#### Verification

- **Objective:** The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array into non-empty segments.
- **Penalty Calculation:** The penalty for each segment is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- **Optimal Splitting Strategy:** The optimal strategy is to split the array into segments where the sum of each segment is zero or positive, minimizing the penalty.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_1`:

- The function `func_1` does not actually calculate the penalty but rather the number of segments required to ensure the sum of each segment is non-negative.
- The function `func_1` returns the count of segments plus one if the final balance is greater than zero. This does not directly compute the penalty but rather the number of segments needed.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should compute the actual penalty based on the segments. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(expression):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
    return count + (balance > 0)

# Corrected main loop
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    parts = expression.split('-')
    result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))
    # Calculate the actual penalty
    penalty = 0
    for part in parts:
        segment_sum = sum(1 if char == '+' else -1 for char in part)
        penalty += abs(segment_sum) * len(part)
    print(penalty)
```

### Conclusion

The original assessment incorrectly assumed that `func_1` computes the penalty directly, whereas it only counts the number of segments. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not compute the actual penalty.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
