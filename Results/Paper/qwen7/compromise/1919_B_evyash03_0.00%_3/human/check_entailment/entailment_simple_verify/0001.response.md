### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the main steps of the program and provides a detailed breakdown of the logic. However, there are a few key points that need further verification and clarification:

1. **Splitting the String:**
   - The string `expression` is split into parts using `'-'` as the delimiter. Each part consists of consecutive `'+ '` characters. This is correct.

2. **Calculating Result Length:**
   - `result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))` calculates the total length of these segments. This is also correct and equivalent to counting the number of `'+ '` characters in the original string.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - It maintains a `balance` variable which tracks the net effect of `'+ '` and `'-'` characters.
   - If at any point `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` and resets `balance` to zero.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`, which effectively counts the number of segments needed to split the array into non-empty segments where the sum of each segment is non-negative.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_1`. The function does not actually compute the minimum penalty but rather counts the number of segments where the balance becomes negative. This is not sufficient to determine the minimum penalty.

### Detailed Explanation

- **Counting Segments vs. Minimizing Penalty:**
  - The function `func_1` counts the number of segments where the balance becomes negative, but it does not ensure that the segments are optimally chosen to minimize the penalty.
  - The optimal strategy involves splitting the array into segments where the sum of each segment is as close to zero as possible, and the length of each segment is minimized.

- **Example Analysis:**
  - Consider the input `expression = "+-+-+"`:
    - The segments are `['+', '-', '+', '-']`.
    - The function `func_1` would count the number of times the balance becomes negative, which is 2.
    - However, the optimal segmentation would be `[['+', '-'], ['+', '-']]`, resulting in a penalty of `2 * 2 = 4`.

- **Correct Approach:**
  - The correct approach involves dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal segmentation.
  - A simple greedy algorithm can be used to split the array into segments where the sum of each segment is non-negative and the length is minimized.

### Conclusion

The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the function `func_1` computes the minimum penalty, when in fact it only counts the number of segments where the balance becomes negative. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
