Output State: **`x` is the next integer from `data[idx]`, `idx` is increased by 1 again, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `idx` is increased by 1 again.**

Explanation: The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. The other variables (`x`, `idx`, and `v[x]`) are updated according to the initial state, and the additional increment of `idx` by 1 is also applied. Therefore, the output state includes these updates.
