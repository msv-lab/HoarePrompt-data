Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `x` is an integer from `data[idx]`; `idx` is increased by 1.**

The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The initial conditions for `n` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be a positive integer, and `x` is still an integer from `data[idx]`. The only change is that `idx` has been incremented by 1.
