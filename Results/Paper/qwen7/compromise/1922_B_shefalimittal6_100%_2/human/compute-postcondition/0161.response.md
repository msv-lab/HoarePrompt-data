Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list containing the string representations of `ans` for each iteration of the loop.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is `idx - 1`.
- `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`.
- `ans` is the accumulated result from the loop's operations on `v` for all iterations.

The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all the string representations of `ans` from each iteration with a newline character and then print them.

Since the exact values of `results`, `idx`, `v`, and the operations performed on `v` within the loop are not specified, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Output: **the string representations of `ans` for each iteration, separated by newlines**
