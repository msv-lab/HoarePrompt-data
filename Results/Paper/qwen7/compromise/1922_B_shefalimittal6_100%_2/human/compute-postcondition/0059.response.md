Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is unchanged, `results` contains a single string which is the str representation of `ans`, `i` is `n`, `ans` is the cumulative sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each `i` from `0` to `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v` up to the `n`-th element, and `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the integer value extracted from `data` at index `idx`. All other variables (`results`, `i`, `ans`, `cnt`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
