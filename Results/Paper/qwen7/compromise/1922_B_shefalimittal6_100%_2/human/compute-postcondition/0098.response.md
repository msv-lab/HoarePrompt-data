Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is increased by `v[4]`.
   - `ans` is unchanged.
   - `i` is 5.
   - `n` is 5.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n` inclusive, i.e., `for i in range(n + 1)`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Update the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 5 and `n` is 5, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to satisfy the condition `i < n + 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes 6.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Final state**:
   - `cnt` is increased by `v[4]` (unchanged).
   - `ans` is unchanged.
   - `i` is now 6.
   - `n` is still 5.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[4]`, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is 6, `n` is 5**
