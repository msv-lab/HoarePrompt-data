Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `idx` will be equal to `n`, `v[x]` will contain the count of each digit from `data` that was processed, and `x` will be the last digit processed; `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `cnt` to 0. This variable does not get updated or used within the given code, so its value remains 0 after the loop. The other variables (`idx`, `v`, and `x`) are described in the initial state and remain unchanged by the provided code snippet.
