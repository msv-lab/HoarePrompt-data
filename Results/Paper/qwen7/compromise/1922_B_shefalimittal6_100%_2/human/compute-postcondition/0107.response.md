Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of all values in `v`, `ans` remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `ans` to the list `results`. Since `ans` remains unchanged and `cnt` is increased by the sum of all values in `v`, the only new information is that `results` now contains a string representation of `ans`.
