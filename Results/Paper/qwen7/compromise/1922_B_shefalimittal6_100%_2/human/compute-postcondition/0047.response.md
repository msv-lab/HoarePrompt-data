Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n + 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is updated to 2.
   - `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.
   - `cnt` is updated to the next value of `v[i]`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Update the relevant variables**:
   - `i` should be set to 3.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the same as before**
