Output State: The loop has executed `n + 1` times. After all iterations, `i` will be `n`, `ans` will be the cumulative sum calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each `i` from `0` to `n`. Specifically, for each `i` where `v[i]` is at least 2, `ans` is increased by `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. Additionally, for each `i` where `v[i]` is at least 3, `ans` is further increased by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Finally, `cnt` will be the sum of all values in `v` after the loop completes.

This means that `ans` captures the total number of unique pairs and triplets of occurrences for each value in `v` up to the `n`-th element, weighted by `cnt`, and `cnt` reflects the total count of occurrences of each value in `v` up to the `n`-th element.
