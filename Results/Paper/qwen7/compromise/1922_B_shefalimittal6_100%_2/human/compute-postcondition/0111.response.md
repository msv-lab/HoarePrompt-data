Output State: **`cnt` is increased by the sum of all values in `v`, `ans` remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `idx` is increased by 1, `v` is a list of length `n+1` filled with zeros, `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `v` with `n+1` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `cnt`, `ans`, `results`, `idx`, or `t`. Therefore, their states remain as described in the initial state.
