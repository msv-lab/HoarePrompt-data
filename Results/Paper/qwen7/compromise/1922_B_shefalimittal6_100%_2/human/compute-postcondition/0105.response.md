Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `v[4] + v[6]`, `ans` is unchanged, `i` is 6, `n` is 5.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increments `cnt` by the value of `v[i]`. Given that `i` is 6, `cnt` is increased by `v[6]`. The initial state had `cnt` increased by `v[4]`, so now `cnt` is increased by both `v[4]` and `v[6]`. The values of `ans`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
