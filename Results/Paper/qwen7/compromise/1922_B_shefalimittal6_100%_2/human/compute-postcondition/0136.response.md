Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `idx - 1`, `ans` is increased by `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` since `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, and otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Given that `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is increased by this value. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` are updated accordingly, while the other variables remain unchanged based on the initial postconditions.
