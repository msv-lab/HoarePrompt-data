Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the one generated by `range(int(input()))`, which we can denote as `_`.

2. **Determine the state of `_`**: The variable `_` is an iterator that takes values from the range specified by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 (since the range function in Python generates numbers starting from 0).

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the input is taken at the start of the loop, the initial state of `t` (which is the input value) must be such that it ensures the loop can execute. Given the constraints, `t` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` such that it is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
