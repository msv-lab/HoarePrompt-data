Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a`, a string `s`, counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' within `s`, and prints the result which is the count of 'map' plus the count of 'pie' minus twice the count of 'mapie'. This process is repeated for each test case provided by the input. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
