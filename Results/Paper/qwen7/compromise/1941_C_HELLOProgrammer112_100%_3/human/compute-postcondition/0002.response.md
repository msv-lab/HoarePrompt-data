Output State: The output state is a list of results, where each result is calculated from the input values of `a` and the string `s` for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, the result is the count of occurrences of the substring 'map' plus the count of occurrences of the substring 'pie', minus twice the count of occurrences of the substring 'mapie'. This process is repeated for each test case provided by the input.
