You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        s = [0 for i in range(l)]
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = ''
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        
        s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
        
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        ans = ''
        
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The final value of `ans` will be a string composed of characters derived from the list `s`. Each character in `ans` corresponds to `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in the original `array`, where `s[j]` is incremented by the number of times `j` appears in `array` across all iterations of the loop. The list `s` will have each of its elements incremented by the total number of times the loop executed. The variable `i` will be equal to the number of test cases, `input_value` will be greater than or equal to the number of test cases, `l` will be the length of the input list for the current test case, and the initial state of `s` will be unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate a string based on the given trace. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  0 0 1 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  A string like `aaab` where the trace `[0, 0, 1, 2]` is correctly represented.

However, the current implementation will generate a string based on the cumulative count of previous occurrences of the character, which does not necessarily match the required trace. For example, the program might generate a string like `aabb`, which does not satisfy the trace `[0, 0, 1, 2]`.

A correct approach would involve maintaining a counter for each character and ensuring that the character at position `i` appears exactly `a_i` times before it in the string. This requires a more sophisticated algorithm to ensure the correct placement of characters according to the trace.
