Output State: **`i` is 0; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l` is the integer input value; `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `s` with `l` elements, all set to 0. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
