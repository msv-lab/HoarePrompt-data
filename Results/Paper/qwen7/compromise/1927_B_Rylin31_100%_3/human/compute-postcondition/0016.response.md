Output State: The final value of `ans` will be a string composed of characters whose ASCII values are `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in the `array`, where `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration until all elements in `array` have been processed. After processing all elements, the value of `s[j]` for each `j` in `array` will be incremented by the number of times `j` was used in the loop.

In simpler terms, `ans` will contain a string formed by converting the values in `s` (starting from index `j` and incrementing `j` each time) to their corresponding characters using ASCII, and `s` will be incremented for each element in `array`.
