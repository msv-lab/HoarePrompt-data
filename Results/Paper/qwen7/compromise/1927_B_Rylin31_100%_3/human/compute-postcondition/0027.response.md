Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `ans` is a string with the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` appended to it twice, `j` is the second element of the `array`, `s[j]` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends a character to the string `ans`. The character is determined by converting `s[j] + 97` to its corresponding ASCII character. Since `s[j]` was already incremented by 1 before this line of code, it means that the character was appended once before. Now, it is being appended again, making it appear twice in the string `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
