Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`, `l` is an input integer.**

The code assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `l`. The initial values of `i` and the condition on `input_value` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still `k + 1`, `input_value` must still be greater than `k + 1`, and `l` is the integer value of the input provided by the user.
