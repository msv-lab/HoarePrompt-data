Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j + 1] + 97`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `s[j]` is `s[j] + 1`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in array:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analyzing the Loop Head
- The loop variable is `j`.
- The loop iterates over each element in the `array`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
- **`j`**: The value of `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
- **`s[j]`**: The value of `s[j]` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is updated based on the current value of `s[j + 1]`.

Given these points, we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Increment `j`**: Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
2. **Update `s[j]`**: The value of `s[j]` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `s[j]` will be `s[j] + 1`.
3. **Update `ans`**: The value of `ans` is updated based on the character whose ASCII value is `s[j + 1] + 97`. For the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`, so `s[j + 1]` will be `s[(j + 1) + 1] = s[j + 2]`.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration
- `ans` will be the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j + 2] + 97`.
- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `s[j]` will be `s[j] + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j + 2] + 97`; `j` is `j + 1`; `s[j]` is `s[j] + 1`.**
