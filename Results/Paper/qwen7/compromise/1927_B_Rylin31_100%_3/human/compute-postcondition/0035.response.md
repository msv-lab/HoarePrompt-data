Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`
   - `l` is an input integer
   - `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0
   - `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())` but now all elements have been processed (the list is empty)
   - `ans` is a string where each character corresponds to `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in the original `array`, with `s[j]` incremented by 1 for each iteration.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs based on the value of `i`.
   - The loop condition is `i < int(input())`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`
   - `l` is an input integer
   - `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0
   - `array` is an empty list
   - `ans` is a string where each character corresponds to `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in the original `array`, with `s[j]` incremented by 1 for each iteration.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.
   - Since `i` is currently `k + 1`, the next value of `i` will be `k + 2`.
   - Therefore, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 2` to allow the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusted States**:
   - `i` changes from `k + 1` to `k + 2`.
   - `input_value` must be greater than `k + 2`.

6. **Other States**:
   - `l` remains the same.
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `array` remains an empty list.
   - `ans` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 2`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is an empty list, `ans` is a string where each character corresponds to `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in the original `array`, with `s[j]` incremented by 1 for each iteration.**
