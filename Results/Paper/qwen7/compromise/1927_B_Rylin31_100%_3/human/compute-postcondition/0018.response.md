Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is increased by 1, and the loop continues if `i` is still less than `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`. Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is still less than `int(input())`.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote `input_value` as the value of `int(input())` from the input. Let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, `k + 1` must be less than `input_value` for the loop to execute one more time.

Since the exact value of `input_value` is not given, we will use the placeholder `input_value` to represent it.

**State Adjustment**:
- `i` needs to be `k + 1` for the next iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i < input_value`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `input_value` remains the same.

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`**
