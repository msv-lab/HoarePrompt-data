The function processes predefined inputs \( t \), \( n \), and \( p \) where \( t \) is an integer between 1 and 5000, \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 50, and \( p \) is a list of \( n \) integers. It initializes a list \( v \) based on the input and checks if a specific condition is met. Depending on the outcome, it prints either 2 or 3 and returns nothing. If \( n \) is 2, it always prints 2. Otherwise, it iterates through the list \( v \) and checks if \( v[v[v[i]]] == i \) for any \( i \) in the range 1 to \( n \). If the condition is met for any \( i \), it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3.
