Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is `False`.
   - `a` is an integer equal to the first input number.
   - `b` is an integer equal to the second input number.
   - `lst[a]` remains unchanged (though its exact content is not specified, it doesn't affect the print statement).
   - `x` is set to the last element that was popped from `lst[x]` during the last iteration of the loop.
   - `lst[x]` is an empty list.
   - `y` is the value that was popped from `lst[x]` in the previous iteration, and `lst[y]` is non-empty.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('Hermione' if s else 'Ron')
   ```

Given that `s` is `False`, the condition `if s` evaluates to `False`. Therefore, the print statement will output `'Ron'`.

Output: **Ron**
