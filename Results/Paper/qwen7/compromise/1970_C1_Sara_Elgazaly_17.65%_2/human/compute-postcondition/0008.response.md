Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` now contains `[b]`, and `x` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `lst[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list at index `a`. Since `lst[b]` originally contained the value `a`, after executing the code, `lst[a]` will contain `[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
