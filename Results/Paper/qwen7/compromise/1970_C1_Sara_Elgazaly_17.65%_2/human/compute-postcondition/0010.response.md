The only objects in the loop head are variables `_`, `x`, and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[b]` now contains `[a]`, and `x` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than 2 (since `x - 1` was used in the loop definition).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[b]` now contains `[a]`, and `x` must be greater than 2**
