Output State: **`s` is True, `a` is an integer equal to the first input number, `b` is an integer equal to the second input number, `lst[a]` and `lst[b]` both contain a list of integers representing all the nodes connected to `a` and `b` respectively, `x` is equal to `y`, `y` is the last element of `lst[x]` after popping it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not modify any variables' values but indicates that the execution has exited the loop or condition block. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
