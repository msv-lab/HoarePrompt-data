Output State: `lst[x]` is an empty list, and `x` is set to the last element that was popped from `lst[x]` during the last iteration of the loop. The list `lst[y]` corresponding to the value of `x` is non-empty, where `y` is the value that was popped from `lst[x]` in the previous iteration. This process continues until `lst[x]` becomes empty, at which point the loop terminates.
