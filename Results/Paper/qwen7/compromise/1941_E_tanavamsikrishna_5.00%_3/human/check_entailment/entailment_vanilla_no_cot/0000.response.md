Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the cost of placing supports in a single row of the river.
   - It ensures that the cost of placing a support in each cell respects the constraints:
     - A support must be placed in the first and last columns.
     - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
   - The function iteratively updates the cost of placing supports in the row according to the given rules.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the entire input and outputs the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges.
   - It reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It then reads the depths of the river cells for each row.
   - For each row, it calls `func_1` to compute the cost of placing supports.
   - It calculates the total cost of building `k` bridges by considering all possible starting rows for the bridges.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in both functions, the provided solution is correct and should produce the expected results for the given test cases.
