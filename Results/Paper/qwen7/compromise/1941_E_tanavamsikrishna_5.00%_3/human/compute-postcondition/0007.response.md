Based on the initial state provided:

- `total_costs` is a list of length `n - (k - 1)`, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
- `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows` retain their original values.
- `total_costs` is populated with these sums.

The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the minimum value among the elements in the `total_costs` list.

To determine the exact value printed, we need to know the specific values of the `costs` list and the parameters `n`, `k`, and `m`. However, since these values are not provided, we can only describe the value in terms of the elements in `total_costs`.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of length n - (k - 1) containing the sums of k consecutive elements from the costs list)**
