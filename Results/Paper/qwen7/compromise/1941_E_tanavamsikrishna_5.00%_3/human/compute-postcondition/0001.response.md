Output State: **(n, m, k, d) are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m; rows is a list of n lists, each containing integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a list of lists named `rows`. Each inner list contains integers that are inputted by the user. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial input values. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged values along with the new list `rows` which is constructed based on the input.
