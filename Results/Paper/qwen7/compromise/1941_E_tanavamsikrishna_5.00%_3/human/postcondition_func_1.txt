The function accepts four parameters (n, m, k, d) and a list of n lists (rows). It calculates the sum of k consecutive elements from the costs list, which is derived from the input rows list using the parameter d. The function then finds the minimum value among these sums and prints it. The final state of the program includes the original values of n, m, k, d, and rows, while introducing a new list called total_costs containing the calculated sums.
