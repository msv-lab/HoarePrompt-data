The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and two binary strings of length \( n \). For each test case, it constructs a new string \( ans \) by concatenating characters from the two input strings based on specific conditions. After processing all test cases, it prints the constructed string \( ans \) for each case and outputs the maximum consecutive count of matching characters between the two input strings.
