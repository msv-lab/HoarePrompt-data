Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input**.

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing spaces from it, and assigns the result to `b`. The initial values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
