Postcondition: `i` is incremented, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string with either the character `a[i-1]` or `b[i]` appended to it, and `work` is a boolean. If `work` is true and `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, `ans` contains the character `b[i]`; otherwise, `ans` contains the character `a[i-1]` and `i` is incremented by 2. If `work` is false, `ans` contains the character `b[i-1]` and `i` is incremented by 2.
