Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is an empty string.**

The code initializes `i` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
