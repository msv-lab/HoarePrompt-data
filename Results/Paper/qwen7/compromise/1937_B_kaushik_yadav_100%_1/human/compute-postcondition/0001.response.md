Output State: **`t` is an integer input from `sys.stdin.readline`, and it is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4**.

This means that `t` has been updated to the integer value read from the standard input (using `sys.stdin.readline`), and it remains within the specified range of 1 to \(10^4\). The other variables (`input`) remain unchanged, with `input` still being set to `sys.stdin.readline`.
