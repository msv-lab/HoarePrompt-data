Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a string with the character `a[i-1]` appended to it, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, and `work` is a boolean.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character at index `i` of the string `a` to the string `ans`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 after this operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
