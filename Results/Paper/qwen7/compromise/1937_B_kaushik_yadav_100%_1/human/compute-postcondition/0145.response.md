Postcondition: `counter` is 2, `i` is either 4 or 5, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is either `a[0] + a[i]`, `a[0] + b[i-1]`, or the first character of `b`, `work` is either False or remains unchanged, `j` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` is greater than 3. If `work` is True and `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i-1] < a[i]`, then `i` is 4 and `ans` is `a[0] + a[5]`. Otherwise, if `work` is True, `i` is 5 and `ans` is `a[0] + a[6]`. If `work` is False, `i` is 4 and `ans` is `a[0] + b[3]`.
