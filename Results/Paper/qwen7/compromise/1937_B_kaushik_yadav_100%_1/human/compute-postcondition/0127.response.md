Postcondition: `counter` is 2, `i` is either 3 or 4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is either `a[0] + a[i]`, `a[0] + b[2]`, or the first character of `b`, `work` is either True or False, `j` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` is greater than 3; if `i + 1` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `ans` remains unchanged and `work` is set to False. Otherwise, `i` is set to either 3 or 4.
