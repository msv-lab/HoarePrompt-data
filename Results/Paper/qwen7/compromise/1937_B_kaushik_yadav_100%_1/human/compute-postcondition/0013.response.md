Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is the first character of `a`, `work` is False, the current value of `b[i-1]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`**

Explanation: The variable `work` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions remain unchanged.
