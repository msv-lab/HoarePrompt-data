Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is either `a[0] + a[i]`, or `a[0] + b[2]`, or the first character of `b`, `work` is False, `j` is 3, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` must be greater than 3.**

The variable `work` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
