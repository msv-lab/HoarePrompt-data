Postcondition: `counter` is 1 or 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged unless `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, in which case it is set to `False`, `j` is 0, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and the loop or if-else block has been fully executed according to the conditions provided.
