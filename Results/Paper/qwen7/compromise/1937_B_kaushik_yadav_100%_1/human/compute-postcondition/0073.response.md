Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `counter` is 1
   - `i` is equal to the length of `a`
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces
   - `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input
   - `ans` is a string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop
   - `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged unless `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, in which case it is set to `False`
   - `j` is 0
   - `len(a)` is greater than 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `j < len(a) - 1`, and currently `j` is 0, the loop can execute again.
   - Therefore, `j` will be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1.

5. **Other states remain unchanged**:
   - `counter` remains 1
   - `i` remains equal to the length of `a`
   - `n` remains an input integer
   - `a` remains the same string without leading or trailing spaces
   - `b` remains the same string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input
   - `ans` remains the same string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop
   - `work` remains unchanged
   - `len(a)` remains greater than 1

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`counter` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is a boolean which remains unchanged, `j` is 1, and `len(a)` is greater than 1**.
