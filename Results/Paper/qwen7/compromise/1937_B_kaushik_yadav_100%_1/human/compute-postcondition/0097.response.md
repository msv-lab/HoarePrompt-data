Postcondition: **`counter` is 2, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is True, `j` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0. Since `work` is True, the program enters the if condition.**
