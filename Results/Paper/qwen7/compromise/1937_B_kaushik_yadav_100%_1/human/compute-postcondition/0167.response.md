Output State: **`counter` is 3, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `j`, and `t` retain their original states.**

Explanation: The variable `counter` is incremented by 1. According to the initial state, `counter` was either 2 or 1 depending on the conditions given. After incrementing, `counter` becomes 3. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `j`, and `t`) remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
