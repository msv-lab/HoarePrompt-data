Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `ans` being set to an empty string.
