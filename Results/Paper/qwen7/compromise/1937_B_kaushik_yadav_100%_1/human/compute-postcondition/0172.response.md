Postcondition: **`counter` is either 3 or 1 depending on the conditions. If `a[j + 1] == b[j]`, then `counter` remains as 3. Otherwise, if `a[j + 1] == '0'` and `b[j] == '1'` initially, and `a[j + 2]` equals `b[j + 1]`, then `counter` becomes 1. In all other cases, `counter` becomes 2. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `work`, `j`, `t`) retain their original states, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
