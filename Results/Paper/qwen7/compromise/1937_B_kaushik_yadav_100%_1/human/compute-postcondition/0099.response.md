Postcondition: `counter` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing spaces, `ans` is `a[0]`, `work` is True, `j` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, and the current value of `i` is less than the length of `a` and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.
