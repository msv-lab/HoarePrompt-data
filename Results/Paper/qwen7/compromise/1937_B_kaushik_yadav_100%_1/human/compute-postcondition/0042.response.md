To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state.

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `i < len(a)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)` at the start of the next iteration.

### Current State
- `i` is incremented during each iteration.
- `n` is an input integer (not directly involved in the loop condition).
- `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces.
- `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input.
- `ans` is a string with either the character `a[i-1]` or `b[i]` appended to it.
- `work` is a boolean.

### Analysis
For the loop to continue, the condition `i < len(a)` must hold true. This means that `i` should be less than the length of `a`.

### Adjustment Needed
Since the loop condition depends solely on `i` and `len(a)`, and given that `i` is incremented within the loop, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. Specifically, `i` must be less than `len(a)` for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` must be less than `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, `ans` is a string with either the character `a[i-1]` or `b[i]` appended to it, and `work` is a boolean.**
