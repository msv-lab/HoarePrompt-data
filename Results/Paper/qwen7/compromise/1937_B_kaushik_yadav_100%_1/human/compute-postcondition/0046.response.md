Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a string with the character `b[i-1]` appended to it, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing spaces from the input, and `work` is a boolean, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block indicated in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. The values of `i`, `ans`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `work` remain unchanged, and the program exits the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
