#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and each query consists of two distinct integers x_i and y_i such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n.
def func():
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        r()
        
        a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
        
        b = [0, 0]
        
        for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
        
        u, = r()
        
        while u:
            u -= 1
            c, d = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `u` is False, `c` is the return value of `r()` from the last iteration, `d` is the second return value of `r()` from the last iteration, `b` is a list with its length equal to the length of `a` plus one, starting with the initial value of `-1000000000.0`, followed by a series of values calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a` after all iterations of the loop have been executed.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `u` becomes `False` because it is decremented until it reaches zero. The values of `c` and `d` are set to the return values of the function `r()` called in the last iteration of the loop, and these values do not change further. The list `b` retains its structure and values based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, starting with the initial value of `-1000000000.0`, after all iterations of the loop have been executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer t indicating the number of subsequent cases, an integer n representing the size of a list a, the list a itself containing n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, and an integer m denoting the number of queries. For each query, the function takes two distinct integers x and y and calculates and prints the difference between specific values in a list b. The list b is constructed based on the differences between consecutive elements of a. After processing all test cases and queries, the function outputs the results of the last query performed.
