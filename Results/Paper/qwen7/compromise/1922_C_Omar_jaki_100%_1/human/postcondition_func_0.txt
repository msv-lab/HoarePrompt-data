The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves an integer t indicating the number of subsequent cases, an integer n representing the size of a list a, the list a itself containing n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, and an integer m denoting the number of queries. For each query, the function takes two distinct integers x and y and calculates and prints the difference between specific values in a list b. The list b is constructed based on the differences between consecutive elements of a. After processing all test cases and queries, the function outputs the results of the last query performed.
