Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `b` is updated based on the new tuple `(a[i], a[i+1], a[i+2], a[i+3])`.
- `v` is equal to `a[i+2] - a[i+1]`.
- `x` is now `a[i+1]`.
- `y` is now `a[i+2]`.
- `v` is now `y - x`, which simplifies to `v = a[i+2] - a[i+1]`.
- `b` is updated by adding `b[-2] + v`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined as follows:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omit
```

From this, we can identify the variables involved in the loop head:
- `w` is assigned the value of `a[i]`.
- `x` is assigned the value of `a[i+1]`.
- `y` is assigned the value of `a[i+2]`.
- `z` is assigned the value of `a[i+3]`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
To determine the states needed for the next iteration, we need to update the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the current values of `x`, `y`, and `z` from the previous iteration.

- `w` is `a[i]`, which is the same as `x` from the previous iteration.
- `x` is `a[i+1]`, which is the same as `y` from the previous iteration.
- `y` is `a[i+2]`, which is the same as `z` from the previous iteration.
- `z` is `a[i+3]`, which needs to be updated to the next element in the list `a`.

Given the previous iteration's states:
- `x` is `a[i+1]`.
- `y` is `a[i+2]`.
- `z` is `a[i+3]`.

For the next iteration:
- `w` will be `a[i+1]` (which is `x`).
- `x` will be `a[i+2]` (which is `y`).
- `y` will be `a[i+3]` (which is `z`).
- `z` will be `a[i+4]`.

### Updated States
- `b` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `v` is updated to `y - x`, which is `a[i+2] - a[i+1]`.
- `x` is updated to `a[i+1]`.
- `y` is updated to `a[i+2]`.
- `z` is updated to `a[i+3]`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `b` is updated based on the new tuple `(a[i], a[i+1], a[i+2], a[i+3])`, `v` is equal to `a[i+2] - a[i+1]`, `x` is now `a[i+1]`, `y` is now `a[i+2]`, `z` is now `a[i+3]`, `b` is updated by adding `b[-2] + v**.
