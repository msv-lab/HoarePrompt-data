Output State: **`u` is False, `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`, `t` is 0**

Explanation: The function `r()` is called without any arguments, which means it will return two values. These values are assigned to `c` and `d`. The variable `u` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `False`. Additionally, `t` is updated to `True - 1`, which evaluates to `0`.
