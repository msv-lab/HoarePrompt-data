Postcondition: **`u` is now falsy; `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`**. 

This means that regardless of whether the condition `c < d` is true or false, the value of `u` remains falsy, and `c` and `d` retain their values as the return values from the function `r()`.
