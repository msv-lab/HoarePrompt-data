Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `b` is a list whose length is equal to the length of `a` plus one.
   - The first element of `b` is `-1000000000.0`.
   - The subsequent elements of `b` are calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a`.

2. **Values of `c` and `d`:**
   - `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`. Since no specific details about `r()` are provided, we assume `c` and `d` are integers.

3. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]`.

4. **Explanation of the Expression:**
   - `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` are used to index into the list `b`.
   - Since `b` starts with `-1000000000.0` and the rest of the elements are based on the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, the exact values depend on the values in `a`.

5. **Calculating the Values:**
   - Let's denote the length of `a` as `n`.
   - Therefore, the length of `b` is `n + 1`.
   - The first element of `b` is `-1000000000.0`.
   - The next elements of `b` are calculated as follows:
     \[
     b[1] = a[0] - a[1]
     \]
     \[
     b[2] = a[1] - a[2]
     \]
     \[
     \vdots
     \]
     \[
     b[n] = a[n-1] - a[n]
     \]

6. **Indexing into `b`:**
   - For `b[c * 2 - 1]`, if `c` is 1, then `c * 2 - 1 = 1`, so it refers to the second element of `b` (which is `a[0] - a[1]`).
   - For `b[d * 2 - 1]`, if `d` is 1, then `d * 2 - 1 = 1`, so it also refers to the second element of `b` (which is `a[0] - a[1]`).

7. **Final Calculation:**
   - If both `c` and `d` are 1, then:
     \[
     b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] = (a[0] - a[1]) - (a[0] - a[1]) = 0
     \]

Given this reasoning, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **0**
