Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `b` is updated based on the new tuple `(a[i], a[i+1], a[i+2], a[i+3])`.
- `v` is equal to `a[i+2] - a[i+1]`.
- `x` is now `a[i+1]`.
- `y` is now `a[i+2]`.
- `v` is now `y - x`, which simplifies to `v = a[i+2] - a[i+1]`.
- `b` is updated by adding `b[-2] + v`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined as:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Variables in the Loop Head
- `w` is `a[i]`.
- `x` is `a[i+1]`.
- `y` is `a[i+2]`.
- `z` is `a[i+3]`.

### Adjusting States
To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to update the values of `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` according to the loop head.

1. **Update `w`**: `w` is `a[i]`. In the next iteration, `i` will increase by 1, so `w` will be `a[i+1]`.
2. **Update `x`**: `x` is `a[i+1]`. In the next iteration, `x` will be `a[i+2]`.
3. **Update `y`**: `y` is `a[i+2]`. In the next iteration, `y` will be `a[i+3]`.
4. **Update `z`**: `z` is `a[i+3]`. In the next iteration, `z` will be `a[i+4]`.

### Updated State
- `b` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `v` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `y` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `v` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `b` is updated by adding `b[-2] + v` in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`b` is updated based on the new tuple `(a[i+1], a[i+2], a[i+3], a[i+4])`, `v` is equal to `a[i+3] - a[i+2]`, `x` is now `a[i+2]`, `y` is now `a[i+3]`, `v` is now `y - x`, `b` is updated by adding `b[-2] + v`**.
