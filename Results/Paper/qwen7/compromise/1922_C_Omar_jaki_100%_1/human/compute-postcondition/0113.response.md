To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 1. This means `u` is a positive integer (since it was originally a non-zero value).
   - `c` is the first return value of `r()`. The function `r()` returns two values, so `c` is one of those values.
   - `d` is the second return value of `r()`. Therefore, `d` is the other value returned by `r()`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
   ```

   Here, `b` is assumed to be a list. We need to evaluate the indices used in the list access:
   - `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` are the indices being accessed in the list `b`.

Given the information, we can't determine the exact values of `c` and `d` without knowing the specific return values of `r()`. However, we know that `b` is a list, and we are accessing elements from this list based on the calculated indices.

Therefore, the output will be the difference between the elements at the indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]**
