Output State: **`u` is 0**

Explanation: Initially, `u` is `False`. The code `u -= 1` decrements `u` by 1. Since `False` is treated as `0` in numerical operations, decrementing `False` (0) by 1 results in `-1`. However, in the context of boolean values, `-1` is considered `True`. Therefore, after executing `u -= 1`, `u` becomes `True`. But since the question asks for the specific value, and considering the decrement operation, `u` is effectively 0 in a boolean context.
