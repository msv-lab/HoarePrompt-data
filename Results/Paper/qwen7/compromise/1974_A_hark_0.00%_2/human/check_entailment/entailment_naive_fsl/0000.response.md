Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. Let's analyze the issue:

1. The formula `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the number of full 2x2 grids needed for `y` icons.
2. The next line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` attempts to adjust `x` based on the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this adjustment is incorrect because it adds back the space taken by 2x2 icons instead of subtracting the space they occupy.
3. The calculation `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is intended to calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, but it is based on an incorrect adjustment of `x`.

To illustrate the error, consider the following test case:
- Input: `12 4`
- Expected output: `2`

However, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed. For instance, if we try to place 12 1x1 icons and 4 2x2 icons, the program might incorrectly calculate the number of screens needed due to the flawed logic in adjusting `x`.

A correct approach would involve calculating the total space required for both types of icons and then determining the minimum number of screens needed to fit them. This requires a more detailed and accurate calculation of the space occupied by each type of icon and how they can be optimally placed across the screens.
