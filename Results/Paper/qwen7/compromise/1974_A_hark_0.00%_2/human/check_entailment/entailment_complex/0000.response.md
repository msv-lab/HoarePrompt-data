### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`. However, this function is not used anywhere in the program, so it does not affect the overall correctness of the program.

2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function is the core logic for calculating the minimum number of screens needed. Let's break down the logic:
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit on the screens (`math.ceil(y / 2)`), and then it calculates the remaining space after placing these icons (`x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`). It then determines how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`) and adds the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`bxsfory`).
   - If only `y` is greater than 0, it simply calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`math.ceil(y / 2)`).
   - If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons (`math.ceil(x / 15)`).
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints `0`.

3. **Function `func_3()`**: This function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_2()`. It does not perform any additional operations after processing all test cases.

Given the logic in `func_2()`, it seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed based on the problem statement. The logic accounts for the different scenarios where the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons can vary, and it correctly handles the constraints of the grid size (5x3).

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented in the functions.

### Correctness:
**True**
