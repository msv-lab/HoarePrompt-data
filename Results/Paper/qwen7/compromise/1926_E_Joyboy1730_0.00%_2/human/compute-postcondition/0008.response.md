Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `_` is now 1, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `m` to `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `m` based on the previous value of `n`.
