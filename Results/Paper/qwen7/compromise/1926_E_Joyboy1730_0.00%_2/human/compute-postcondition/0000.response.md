Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) remains valid, and the value of `t` is updated to the input integer.
