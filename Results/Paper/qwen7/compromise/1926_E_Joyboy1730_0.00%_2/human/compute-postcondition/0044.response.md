Output State: **`k` is unchanged - `tot`, `L` must have at least one element, `a` is the next element in `L`, `tot` is now equal to `tot + a`, `pow` is quadrupled.**

Explanation: The code `pow *= 2` doubles the value of `pow`. Since `pow` was previously doubled (from its original value), it is now quadrupled. The other variables (`k`, `tot`, `L`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
