Output State: **`k` is decreased by `2 * (tot + a_next)`, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `pow` is 4, `t` is 1, `tot` is increased by `a`, and `tot` is now greater than or equal to `k`**.

Explanation: The code `tot += a` increases the value of `tot` by the value of `a`. Given the postcondition that if `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, the new value of `tot` will be such that `tot` is now greater than or equal to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
