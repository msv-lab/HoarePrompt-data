Output State: **`tot` equals the sum of all elements in `L`, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `pow` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block was specified in the code, the only effect is that we break out of the implied loop or conditional. All other variables retain their initial values.
