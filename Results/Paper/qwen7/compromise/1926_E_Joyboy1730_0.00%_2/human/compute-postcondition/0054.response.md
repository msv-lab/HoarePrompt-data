Output State: **`k` is unchanged from its initial value, `tot` equals the sum of all elements in `L`, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `m = (n + 1) // 2` does not affect the values of `k`, `tot`, or `n`. It only updates the value of `m` to be `(n + 1) // 2`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
