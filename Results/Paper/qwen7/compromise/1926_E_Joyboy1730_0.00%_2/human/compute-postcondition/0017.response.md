Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `_` is 1, `n` is 0, `k` is an input integer, `L` is an empty list, `m` is 0, `tot` is 0, `pow` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `pow` is assigned the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` remains greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `_` stays as 1, `n` remains 0, `k` remains an input integer, `L` remains an empty list, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is 0 since `n` is 0, and `tot` remains 0.
