Output State: **`k` is decreased by `2 * (tot + a)`, `n` is 1, `m` is 1, `pow` is 2, `t` is 1, `tot` is increased by `a`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= tot` subtracts the value of `tot` from `k`. Given that `tot` was previously increased by `a`, `tot` is now `tot + a`. Therefore, `k` is decreased by `tot + a`, which is equivalent to `2 * (tot + a)` since `k` was already decreased by `tot + a` before this line of code. The values of `n`, `m`, `pow`, `t`, and the updated `tot` remain unchanged.
