Output State: **`k` is decreased by `tot`, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `pow` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `k` was being decreased by `tot`. The values of `n`, `m`, `pow`, and the condition that `L` must contain at least one element remain unchanged.
