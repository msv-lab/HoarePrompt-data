Output State: **`k` is decreased by the sum of all elements in `L`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is 0, `pow` is 2^0, and `t` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs from the user and splits them by space, converting them to integers and assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state of `k` being decreased by the sum of all elements in `L` remains unchanged because no such list `L` is involved in the current code snippet. The values of `m`, `pow`, and `t` remain as they were initially set. `n` is now an integer input from the user.
