### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and function summary.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCasos`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions.
   - It initializes `pergunta` to infinity and `x` to 0.

3. **Loop Through Queue:**
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (backwards).
   - For each position `i`:
     - If `i` is less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
     - It then adds the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `x`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints `pergunta`, which holds the minimum cost.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `pergunta` is initialized to infinity, ensuring that any valid cost will be smaller initially.

2. **Backward Loop:**
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (backwards).
   - This ensures that the cost of moving Kirill to earlier positions is calculated considering the costs of all subsequent positions.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - For each position `i`, the cost of moving Kirill to that position is considered.
   - If `i` is within the allowed range (`i < m`), the cost is updated to the minimum of its current value and the accumulated cost `x` plus `a[i]`.
   - The accumulated cost `x` is updated by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `pergunta` is printed, which represents the minimum cost for Kirill to be in one of the first `m` positions.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Backward Iteration:** The backward iteration ensures that the cost of moving Kirill to earlier positions is correctly calculated by considering the costs of all subsequent positions.
- **Cost Update:** The cost update logic correctly considers both `a[i]` and `b[i]` to find the minimum cost path.
- **Minimum Cost:** The variable `pergunta` is updated to store the minimum cost, ensuring that the final value printed is indeed the minimum cost required.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions by considering the costs of each position and the cumulative cost of moving through the queue.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate.
