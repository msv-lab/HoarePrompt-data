Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly initializes variables `a` and `b` as lists of integers and `n` and `m` as positive integers.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate parameters.
   - It iterates backward through the list `a` from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `i < m` and updates `pergunta` accordingly.
   - It also updates `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it.
   - The logic inside the loop seems to correctly accumulate the cost and find the minimum cost required to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `pergunta`, which is the minimum cost calculated.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `m` could be 1 or equal to `n`.
   - The logic accounts for the cumulative cost calculation and the minimum cost update correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` processes the input data as required and computes the minimum cost accurately.

Correctness: **True**
