The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `pergunta`, which is a string; `a` and `b`, which are both lists of integers; `n`, which is a positive integer; and `m`, which is also a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= n` and the length of `pergunta` is `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `pergunta`, two lists of integers `a` and `b`, a positive integer `n`, and another positive integer `m` where `1 <= m <= n`. It returns a value based on the relationship between the elements of `pergunta`, `a`, and `b` at index `m-1`.**
