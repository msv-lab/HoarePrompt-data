Functionality: **The function processes two lists of integers `a` and `b` along with indices `n` and `m` to compute a specific value related to these lists. It iterates through the lists from index `n-1` to `m-1`, updating a cumulative sum `x` by adding the minimum of the current elements in `a` and `b`. It also updates a variable `pergunta` to store the minimum value between `x + a[i]` and the current value of `pergunta` for each iteration. Finally, it prints and returns the value of `pergunta`, which represents the minimum value obtained by comparing `x + a[i]` for all `i` from `m-1` to `n-1`.**
