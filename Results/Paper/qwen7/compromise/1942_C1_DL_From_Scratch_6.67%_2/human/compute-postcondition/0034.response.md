Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(x - 1)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = x - 2`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `x - 2`. For the loop to start executing, `i` should be less than `x - 1` (the upper bound of the range).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < x - 1`. Given that `i` starts at `x - 2`, the loop will execute exactly once because `x - 2 < x - 1` is true.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` should be set to `x - 2`.
   - The variable `x` should be such that the loop condition `i < x - 1` holds true.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `x - 2`, `x` must be greater than `x - 1`**

However, since `x` being greater than `x - 1` is always true for any positive integer `x`, we can simplify this to just ensuring `i` is correctly initialized.

State: **`i` is `x - 2`**

This ensures that the loop will execute once.
