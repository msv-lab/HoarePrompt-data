Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a value indicating whether the given x integers form a valid set based on the specified conditions.**

This means the function processes input data structured in a specific way across multiple test cases. Each test case starts with three integers (n, x, y) and then a list of x distinct integers. The function checks if these integers meet certain criteria and returns a result based on the validation.
