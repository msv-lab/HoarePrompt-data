Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]`, `count` is the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution, and `T` is `T - 1`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The values of `i`, `num`, `count`, and `T` remain unchanged from their initial state.
