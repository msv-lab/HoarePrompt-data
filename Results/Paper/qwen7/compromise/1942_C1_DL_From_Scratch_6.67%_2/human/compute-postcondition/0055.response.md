Output State: **`count` is `count + 1`, `num` is 1**.

The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Since `count` was previously the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution, after this line, `count` will be one more than its previous value. The value of `num` remains unchanged at 1.
