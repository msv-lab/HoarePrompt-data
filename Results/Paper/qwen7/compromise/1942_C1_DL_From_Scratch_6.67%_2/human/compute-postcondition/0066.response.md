Output State: **`i` is less than `x - 1`, `num` is 1, `count` is 1, `T` is `T - 1`, `list0` is sorted.**

The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Since `count` was initially 0, after executing this line, `count` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
