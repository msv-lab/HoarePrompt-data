Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `fnd` is 0, `D` is a Counter object representing the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing `cnt_aa` minus `D`, `C` is an empty list, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `in_aa` is undefined, `out_aa` is undefined, `bb` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `aa` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements of `bb`.**

Explanation: The line `E = cnt_aa - D` subtracts the Counter object `D` (which represents the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`) from `cnt_aa`. This operation results in a new Counter object `E` that contains only the elements present in `cnt_aa` but not in `D`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
