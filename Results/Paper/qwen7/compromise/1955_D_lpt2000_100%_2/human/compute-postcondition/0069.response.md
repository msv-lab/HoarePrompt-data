Postcondition: **`E[out_aa]` and `D[out_aa]` are integers. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**
