Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `m` is less than `n`, and `n - m` is greater than 0, and the value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `D[out_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `D[out_aa]` by 1. Since `D[out_aa]` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing, it remains greater than 0. The conditions involving `m`, `n`, and `E[out_aa]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
