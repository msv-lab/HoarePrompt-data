Output State: **`fnd` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `pairs_in_D` is now greater than or equal to `k`; `m` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`; `n - m` is greater than 1; `D[out_aa]` is either decreased by 2 or remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is either `pairs_in_D + 1` or decreased by 1; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `E[out_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `E[out_aa]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
