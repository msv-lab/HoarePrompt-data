Postcondition: `fnd` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `pairs_in_D` is now greater than or equal to `k`; `m` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`; `n - m` is greater than 1; `D[out_aa]` is either decreased by 2, decreased by 1, or remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is either decreased by 1 or remains unchanged; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1 (if `C[in_aa] > 0`) or by 2 (if the condition is not met); `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is either `pairs_in_D + 1` or decreased by 1; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.
