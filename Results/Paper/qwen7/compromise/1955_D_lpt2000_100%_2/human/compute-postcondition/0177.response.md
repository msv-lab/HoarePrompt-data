Postcondition: `m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 0. `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, and either `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 or `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. If `D[out_aa]` is equal to -1, then no changes are made to the variables.
