Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` and 0 otherwise, all other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; `m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 0; `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0; if `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0; otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and either `E[out_aa]` is not decreased by 1 or `D[out_aa]` is not decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is not increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `pairs_in_D` is now greater than or equal to `k`; `m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 1; `D[out_aa]` is either decreased by 1 or remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is not decreased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is either `pairs_in_D + 1` or decreased by 1; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is either 3 or 2 depending on whether `pairs_in_D` was already greater than or equal to `k`; `m` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`; `n - m` is greater than 1; `D[out_aa]` is either decreased by 2, decreased by 1, or remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is either decreased by 1 or remains unchanged; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1 (if `C[in_aa] > 0`) or by 2 (if the condition is not met); `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is either `pairs_in_D + 1` or decreased by 1; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
