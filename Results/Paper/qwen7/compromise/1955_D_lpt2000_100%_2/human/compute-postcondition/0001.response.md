State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(nabors):`, which means the loop will iterate `nabors` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `nabors` must be a positive integer because `range()` requires its argument to be a non-negative integer.
3. Additionally, the problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ nabors ≤ 10^4`, meaning `nabors` must be within this range.
4. No other variables or states outside the loop head (`_` and `nabors`) need adjustment since they are not mentioned in the loop head and their values are not relevant to the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.
