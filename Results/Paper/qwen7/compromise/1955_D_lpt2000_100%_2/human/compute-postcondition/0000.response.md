Output State: **`nabors` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `nabors` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `nabors = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `nabors`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and the code only changes the value of `t` to `nabors`, the updated state is that `nabors` is now an input integer within the same range. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
