Output State: **`fnd` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; `m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 1; `D[out_aa]` is either decreased by 1 or remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1 if it was greater than 0, otherwise `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `D[in_aa] += 1` increases the value of `D[in_aa]` by 1. No other variables are directly affected by this line of code. The conditions and relationships between the other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
