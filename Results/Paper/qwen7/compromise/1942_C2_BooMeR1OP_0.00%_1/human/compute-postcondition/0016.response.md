Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), `y` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is (num - 1) for each num in the original list `a`, `present` is a set containing all elements from the list `a` minus one, `ans` is the final value of `ans` after executing the loop, `gaps` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a` modulo `n` plus `n` if it's the last element, with all values greater than 0, and `gaps` is sorted.
