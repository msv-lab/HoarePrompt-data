Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and the iterable `cas_de_test`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `cas_de_test` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) representing the scores of the three players in each test case, sorted non-decreasingly such that \( 0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 \).
   - `resultats` is an empty list.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over each inner list in `cas_de_test`.
   - For the loop to execute, `cas_de_test` must contain at least one list.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `cas_de_test` is a list of lists, and the loop will iterate over each list, `cas_de_test` must have at least one element.
   - The variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be assigned the values from the inner lists during each iteration.

5. **Final state after adjustment**:
   - Ensure that `cas_de_test` has at least one list.
   - The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be assigned from the first list in `cas_de_test`.

Given this analysis, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: `t` is a positive integer, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists that must have at least one list, `p1` is the first score in the first list, `p2` is the second score in the first list, `p3` is the third score in the first list.**

This ensures that the loop can execute as intended.
