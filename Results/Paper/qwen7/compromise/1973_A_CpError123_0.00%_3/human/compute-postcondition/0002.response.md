Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `(p1, p2, p3)` is an iterable from the `cas_de_test` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are the elements of the tuples extracted from `cas_de_test`.
   - `cas_de_test` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers sorted non-decreasingly.
   - `resultats` is an empty list and does not affect the loop's execution directly.

3. **Conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `cas_de_test` to iterate over.
   - Each element in `cas_de_test` is a list of three integers `[p1, p2, p3]` where `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since `cas_de_test` is a list of lists, the loop will execute as long as `cas_de_test` is not empty.
   - For the first iteration, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be the first list in `cas_de_test`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `cas_de_test` must contain at least one list.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be the first list in `cas_de_test`.

State: **`cas_de_test` is a list of lists that must contain at least one list, `p1` is the first element of the first list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the first list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the first list in `cas_de_test`**
