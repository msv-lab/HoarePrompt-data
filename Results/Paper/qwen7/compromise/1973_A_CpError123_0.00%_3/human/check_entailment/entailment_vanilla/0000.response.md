### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) of three players.
   - A draw gives 1 point to each player, while a win/loss gives 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser.
   - The scores are given in non-decreasing order: \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program iterates over a predefined list of test cases (`cas_de_test`).
   - For each test case, it calculates the total points and checks if they can be achieved through a combination of wins and draws.
   - The main logic is in the `func_1` function, which:
     - Checks if the total points are even (since each match contributes either 2 points or 2 points minus 1 for each draw).
     - Calculates the total number of matches from the total points.
     - Checks if the total number of matches is feasible (i.e., not more than 3 matches per pair).
     - Computes the number of draws using the formula derived from the points distribution.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program correctly handles the basic constraints and edge cases.
   - It checks if the total points are even, ensuring that only valid scenarios are considered.
   - It ensures that the number of matches does not exceed the maximum possible (3 matches per pair).
   - The calculation of the number of draws is based on the difference in points and the total points, which is a valid approach.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly identifies invalid scenarios where the scores cannot be achieved (e.g., odd total points, more matches than possible, etc.).
   - It returns -1 for such cases, which is the correct output.

5. **Test Cases:**
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including valid and invalid cases.
   - The program produces the expected outputs for these test cases.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of draws for the given scores. It handles all the necessary constraints and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
