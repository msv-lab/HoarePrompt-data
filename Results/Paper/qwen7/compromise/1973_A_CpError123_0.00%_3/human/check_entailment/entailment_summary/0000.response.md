Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly handles the input parameters `t` and `cas_de_test`.
2. For each test case, the function checks if the total points are odd. If they are, it immediately appends `-1` to the results list, which is correct because an odd total points cannot be achieved with the given scoring rules.
3. It then calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) from the total points. This step is correct as the total points should be even and equal to twice the number of matches.
4. The function checks if the total number of matches exceeds 3 or if the highest score exceeds half the total matches. If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to the results list, which is correct because these scenarios are not possible according to the problem statement.
5. If the above conditions are satisfied, it calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites // 2`. This calculation is based on the difference in scores and is correct as it accounts for the points distribution due to wins and draws.
6. The function returns a list of results, where each element corresponds to the number of draws for each valid test case, and `-1` for invalid cases.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws for each test case based on the given scores.

Correctness: **True**
