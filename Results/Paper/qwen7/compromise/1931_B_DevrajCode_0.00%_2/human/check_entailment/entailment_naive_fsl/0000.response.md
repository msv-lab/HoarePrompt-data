Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Total Water Divisibility Check**: The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). This is a necessary condition for making all containers have the same amount of water.

2. **Target Water Calculation**: If the total water is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).

3. **Balance Check**: The program then iterates through each container and checks if the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount accumulates to zero. If at any point the accumulated difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the containers to the target amount.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly handles all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
