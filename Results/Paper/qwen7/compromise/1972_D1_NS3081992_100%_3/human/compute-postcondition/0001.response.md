Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the product of n and m does not exceed 2⋅10^6.**

The code initializes `i` to 1, which does not affect the values of `n` and `m`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of `n` and `m` being positive integers within the specified range and their product not exceeding \(2 \cdot 10^6\).
