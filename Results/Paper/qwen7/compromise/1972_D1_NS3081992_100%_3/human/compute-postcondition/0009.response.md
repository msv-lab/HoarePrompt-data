Output State: **The program returns the minimum value obtained from `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` such that `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, plus 1.**

This means the program returns the smallest result from the function calls `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was originally set to 0, incremented by 1.
