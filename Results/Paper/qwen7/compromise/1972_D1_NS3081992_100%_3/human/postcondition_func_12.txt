The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \neq 0\). It returns either (1, 0, `a`) or (`y`, `x - a // b * y`, `g`), where `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. In the first case, it directly returns 1, 0, and `a`. In the second case, it recursively calculates the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm and returns the coefficients `y` and `x - a // b * y`, along with the GCD `g`.
