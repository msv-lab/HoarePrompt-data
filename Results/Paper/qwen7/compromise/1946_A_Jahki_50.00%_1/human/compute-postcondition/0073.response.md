Output State: **`op` is incremented by 1, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, and `b[ma]` is increased by 1, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]` after the code executes.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Since `b[ma]` was already increased by 1 before this line, `new_median` now holds the value of `b[ma]` after the increment. All other variables remain unchanged.
