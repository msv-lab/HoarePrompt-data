Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `total` is 0.
   - `case` is an input string.
   - `op` is incremented by 3.
   - `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits.
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`.
   - `new_median` is `b[ma]`, which is now greater than `median`.
   - `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`.
   - `i` is `k + 1`.
   - `b[ma]` is incremented by 3.
   - `b` is a sorted version of list `a` and has been sorted twice during the loop iterations.
   - `new_median` is `b[ma]`, which is now greater than `median`.

2. **Operations:**
   - The loop continues to increment `b[ma]` and `op` until `new_median` becomes greater than `median`.
   - After executing the loop three times, `op` is incremented by 3, `b[ma]` is incremented by 3, and `new_median` is also `b[ma]`, which is now greater than `median`.

3. **Final Values:**
   - Since `op` is incremented by 3 each time through the loop and the loop runs three times, `op` will have been incremented by 9 in total.
   - Therefore, the final value of `op` is 9.

Given this, the print statement `print(op)` will output the value of `op`, which is 9.

Output: **9**
