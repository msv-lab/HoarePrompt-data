Output State: **`op` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer greater than 10000, `case` is the input string, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. All the initial conditions remain the same.
