Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. After all iterations, the final state of the variables will be:

- `op` will be incremented for each iteration where the condition `new_median <= median` is true.
- `total` will remain 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
- `a` will be a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers.
- `b` will be a sorted list of integers from `a`.
- `median` will be the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`.
- `ma` will be `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` will be `num2 // 2`.
- `new_median` will be the element at index `ma` in list `b` and will be equal to `b[ma]` after the last iteration where the condition `new_median <= median` is true.
- `b[ma]` will be incremented each time the condition `new_median <= median` is true, making it the highest frequency element in the list `b`.

In summary, the loop will terminate when `new_median` becomes greater than `median`, and `op` will count the number of iterations until that point. The list `b` will be modified such that the element at index `ma` (the potential median) will be incremented each time the condition is met, reflecting its frequency in the sorted list.
