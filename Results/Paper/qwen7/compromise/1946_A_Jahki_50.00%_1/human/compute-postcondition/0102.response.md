Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `new_median <= median`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `case` is an input string
   - `op` is `op + 1`
   - `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`
   - `new_median` is `b[ma]`
   - `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `b[ma]` is incremented by 1
   - `b` is a sorted version of list `a`

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on `new_median` and `median`.
   - Since `new_median` is defined as `b[ma]`, and `b` is a sorted version of `a`, the only way to change `new_median` is by changing `b[ma]`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to continue, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.
   - Since `new_median` is `b[ma]`, and `b[ma]` has already been incremented by 1, we need to ensure that `b[ma]` is still less than or equal to `median` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `b[ma]` to ensure it remains less than or equal to `median`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is `op + 1`, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` is `b[ma]` and must be less than or equal to `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `b` is a sorted version of list `a`**.
