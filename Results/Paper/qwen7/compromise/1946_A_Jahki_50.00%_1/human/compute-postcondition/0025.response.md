Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, `new_median` is equal to `median` - 1, and `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`. If `num2` is an even number, `ma` is further specified as (`num2` / 2) - 1; b[ma] is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[ma] += 1` increments the value at index `ma` in list `b` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
