Postcondition: `op` is 3, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, and `new_median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, which has been incremented 3 times during the loop iterations.
