Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `new_median <= median`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000
   - `case` is a string
   - `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`
   - `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`
   - `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, where `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`
   - `op` is increased by 1
   - `b` is now a sorted version of the original `b` list

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - The loop condition `new_median <= median` must be true for the loop to continue.
   - Since `new_median` and `median` are both elements of the list `b` and `b` is sorted, `new_median` is the middle element of the list `b`.

For the loop to continue, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`. Given that `new_median` and `median` are both the middle element of the list `b`, the only way for the loop to continue is if `new_median` is still less than or equal to `median` after the loop body executes.

Since no changes are made to `new_median` or `median` within the loop body (as indicated by the comment "the loop body is omit"), the only way for the loop to continue is if `new_median` is still less than or equal to `median` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `new_median` is less than or equal to `median` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, where `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`, and `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`**.
