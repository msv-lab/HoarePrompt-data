Based on the initial state provided:

- `case` is an input string.
- `op` is incremented multiple times but starts at 0.
- `total` remains 0.
- `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits.
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median`.
- `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`.
- `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`.
- `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration where it is less than or equal to `median` until it becomes greater than `median`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `op` is 0.

The `print(16668)` statement simply prints the number 16668.

Output: **16668**
