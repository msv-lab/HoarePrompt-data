Output State: **`case` is an input string, `op` is incremented multiple times, `total` remains 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, and `new_median` is incremented by 1 in each iteration where it is less than or equal to `median` until it becomes greater than `median`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `b` is a sorted version of list `a`. `new_median` is assigned the value of `median`.**

In this step, the line `new_median = median` simply assigns the current value of `median` to `new_median`. This does not change the values of any other variables or lists. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that `new_median` now holds the same value as `median`.
