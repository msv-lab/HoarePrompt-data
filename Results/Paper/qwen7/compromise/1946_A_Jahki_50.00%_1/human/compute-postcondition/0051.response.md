Output State: **`op` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, and `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, where `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`.**

Explanation: The code `a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]` creates a new list `a` by iterating over each element `i` in the string `case.split()`, converting it to an integer if it is a digit, and adding it to the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
