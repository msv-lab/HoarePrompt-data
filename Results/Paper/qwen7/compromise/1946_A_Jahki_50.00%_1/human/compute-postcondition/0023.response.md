Output State: **`op` is 0, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, and `new_median` is equal to `median`, and `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`. If `num2` is an even number, `ma` is further specified as (`num2` / 2) - 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. Since `median` was already defined, `new_median` now holds the same value as `median`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
