Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000
- `case` is a string
- `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`
- `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`
- `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, where `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`
- `op` is 3, indicating that the loop executed 3 times

The key point here is that `op` is explicitly stated to be 3, and this value does not change during the execution of the loop or any other operations. Therefore, when the `print(op)` statement is executed, it will simply print the value of `op`.

Output: **3**
