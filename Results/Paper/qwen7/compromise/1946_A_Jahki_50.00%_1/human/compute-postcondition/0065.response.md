Output State: **`b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.**

Explanation: The line `b[ma] += 1` increments the value at index `ma` in list `b` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and their definitions.
