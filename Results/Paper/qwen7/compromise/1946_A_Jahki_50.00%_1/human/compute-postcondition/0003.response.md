Output State: **`num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string.**

The code `case = input()` assigns the value of the user's input (a string) to the variable `case`. The other variables (`num`, `i`, and `num2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
