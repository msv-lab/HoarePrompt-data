Output State: `total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is incremented by 3, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` is `b[ma]` which is now greater than `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, `b[ma]` has been incremented by 3, `b` is a sorted version of list `a`.

In this final state, the variable `total` remains 0 as it was not affected by the loop. The variable `case` remains unchanged as it is the input string. The variable `op` has been incremented by 3 because the loop executed 3 times. The list `a` contains the same elements as initially but as integers from `case.split()`. The list `b` is sorted and contains the same elements as `a`, but with the element at index `ma` incremented by 3 since `new_median` was incremented by 1 in each iteration until it became greater than `median`. The variable `new_median` is now the element at index `ma` in list `b` and is greater than `median`. The variable `median` is still the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`. The variable `i` is `k + 1` as it was not affected by the loop.
