Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    op = 0
    if num2 > 10000:
        print(1)
        print(16668)
        break
    else:
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
        median = b[ma]
        new_median = median
        while new_median <= median:
            b[ma] += 1
            op += 1
            b = sorted(b)
            new_median = b[ma]
        print(op)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `op` is 3, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer, `case` is a string, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, and `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, where `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`. If `num2` is greater than 10000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `op` is incremented multiple times, `total` remains 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, and `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, with `new_median` being incremented by 1 in each iteration where it is less than or equal to `median` until it becomes greater than `median`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `case` is an input string, `op` is incremented by 3, `total` remains 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` is `b[ma]` which is now greater than `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, `b[ma]` is incremented by 3, `b` is a sorted version of list `a` and has been sorted twice during the loop iterations, `new_median` is `b[ma]`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
