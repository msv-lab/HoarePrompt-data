Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the values and conditions for various variables. However, the `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer 1. None of the other variables (like `op`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, `total`, `a`, `b`, `median`, and `new_median`) are used in this specific print statement. Therefore, the output is simply the integer 1.
