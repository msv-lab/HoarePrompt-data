Output State: **`total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is op + 1, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1, `b` is a sorted version of list `a`.**

Explanation: The line `new_median = b[ma]` simply assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `new_median` is now explicitly defined as `b[ma]`.
