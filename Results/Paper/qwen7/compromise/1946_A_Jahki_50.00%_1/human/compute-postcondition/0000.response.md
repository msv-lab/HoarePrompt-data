Output State: **`num` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code. The value of `num` is now an integer obtained from the input, while `t` still represents the number of test cases as specified in the initial state.
