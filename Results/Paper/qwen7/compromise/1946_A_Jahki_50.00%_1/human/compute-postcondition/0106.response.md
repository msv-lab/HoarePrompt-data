Output State: **`total` is 0, `case` is an input string, `op` is `op + 2`, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `new_median` is `b[ma]` and must be less than or equal to `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `i` is `k + 1`, `b[ma]` is incremented by 1 (so `b[ma]` is now `b[ma] + 1`), `b` is a sorted version of list `a` and `b` is sorted again, `new_median` is `b[ma]`**

Explanation: The line `new_median = b[ma]` simply assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Since `b` is already sorted and `b[ma]` is incremented by 1 before this line, `new_median` will take the value of `b[ma]` which is now `b[ma] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
