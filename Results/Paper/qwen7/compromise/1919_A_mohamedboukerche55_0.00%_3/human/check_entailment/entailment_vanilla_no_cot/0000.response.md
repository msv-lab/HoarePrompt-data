Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy for the game. The logic in the given function is flawed because it simply checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and decides the winner based on that condition. This is not a correct approach to solve the problem.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to understand the game dynamics more deeply. The key observation here is that the player whose turn it is when the number of coins in both wallets is equal (i.e., `a == b`) will lose because they cannot make a valid move (since they would have to remove a coin and then swap, leaving them with zero coins). Therefore, the player who can force the game into a state where `a == b` on the opponent's turn will win.

Given this insight, the correct logic should be:
- If `a` and `b` are equal, the player whose turn it is will lose.
- Otherwise, the player whose turn it is can always force the game into a state where the opponent will eventually face a situation where `a == b`.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This version correctly determines the winner based on the optimal strategy for the game.
