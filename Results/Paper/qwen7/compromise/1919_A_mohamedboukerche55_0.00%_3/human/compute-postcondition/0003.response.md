Output: **bob  **

Explanation: The precondition states that `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\), and their sum is even. However, the `print` statement does not reference `a` or `b`. Instead, it directly prints the string `'bob  '`. Therefore, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`, the output will be the string `'bob  '`.
