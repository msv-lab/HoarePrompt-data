Output State: **`coord` is a list containing a tuple `(x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are integers from the input split, `i` is 0, `x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The list `coord` and the variable `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `coord` still contains a tuple `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are integers from the input split, and `i` remains 0.
