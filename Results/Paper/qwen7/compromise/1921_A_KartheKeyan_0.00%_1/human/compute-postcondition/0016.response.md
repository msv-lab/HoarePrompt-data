Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split value, `y` is an input integer from the third split value, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((1, `y`), (`x`, `y`), (2, `y`), (3, `y`)), and `coord` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `coord` using the built-in `sorted()` function. Since the tuples in `coord` all have the same second element (`y`), they will be sorted based on their first elements. The sorted order will be: ((1, `y`), (2, `y`), (3, `y`), (`x`, `y`)). However, since `x` is an input integer from the third split value and the exact value of `x` is not specified, we keep it as `x` in the sorted list. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
