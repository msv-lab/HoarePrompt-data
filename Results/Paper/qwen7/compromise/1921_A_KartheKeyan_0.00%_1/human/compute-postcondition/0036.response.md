Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is the last input integer from the third iteration, `y` is the last input integer from the third iteration, `coord` is a list of three tuples sorted by the first element of each tuple.**

Explanation: The `sorted()` function sorts the `coord` list based on the first element of each tuple. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `x` and `y` for each iteration, we only know they are the values from the last iteration (third iteration) because the loop completes all its iterations (4 times). The value of `i` remains 4 as it was not modified within the given code snippet.
