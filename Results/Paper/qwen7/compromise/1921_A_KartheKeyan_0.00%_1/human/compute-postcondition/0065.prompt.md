You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. It is guaranteed that these points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

    #State: Output State: `n` is 0, `s` is the sum of the results from all iterations of the loop, and we have processed `t` test cases.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will be 0 because the loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero. The variable `s` will be the cumulative sum of the results (`res`) from each iteration of the loop. Since the loop processes each test case completely before moving on to the next, and we started with processing `t-1` test cases, after all iterations, we would have processed `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t sets of coordinates (x_i, y_i) for the corners of squares. The function returns whether the given points form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
