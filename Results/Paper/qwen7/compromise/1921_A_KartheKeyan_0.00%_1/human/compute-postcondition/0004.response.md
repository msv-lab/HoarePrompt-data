Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of \((l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2\) for each test case, and we have processed \(t-1\) test cases; `coord` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `t`, or the `coord` list. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `res` set to 0.
