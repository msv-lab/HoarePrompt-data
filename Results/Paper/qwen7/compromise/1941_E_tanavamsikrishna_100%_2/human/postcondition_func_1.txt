The function accepts four integers \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \), along with a list of \( n \) lists named `rows`. Each inner list in `rows` contains \( m \) positive integers representing the depths of river cells, with the first and last elements being 0. The function calculates the sum of every \( k \) consecutive elements from a derived list `costs`, which is computed using `func_1` for each row in `rows`. Finally, it prints the minimum value among these sums.
