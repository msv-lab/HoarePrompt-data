### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function takes a row of river depths and a maximum distance `d` between supports.
   - It initializes the first element of the row to 1 and updates subsequent elements based on the original second element plus 2 times the index.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the smallest values in the current window of size `d`.
   - For each element beyond the initial `d` elements, it pops the smallest value from the heap, updates the current element, and pushes both the updated value and the current index back into the heap.
   - The function returns the last element of the updated row, which represents the total cost of installing supports for that row.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes the entire grid of river depths.
   - It reads the dimensions and the grid from input.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row and stores the results in a list called `costs`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible sequence of `k` consecutive rows by summing up the corresponding elements in `costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among these sequences.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop around the function calls.
   - Each row's cost calculation is done correctly using `func_1`.
   - The overall cost calculation for sequences of `k` rows is done correctly using `func_2`.
   - The logic for finding the minimum total cost is sound and follows the problem statement.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.
