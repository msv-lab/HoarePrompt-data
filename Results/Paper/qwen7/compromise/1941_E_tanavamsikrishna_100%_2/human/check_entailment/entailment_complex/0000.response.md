### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the correctness of the provided solution step-by-step.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes a list `row` and an integer `d` as input.
   - It initializes the first element of `row` to 1.
   - Then, it populates the next `d-1` elements based on a specific formula.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum values in the current window of size `d`.
   - For each subsequent element in `row`, it updates the value based on the minimum value found in the heap and adds 1.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of the updated `row`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the entire input and calls `func_1` for each row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It finds the minimum total cost among these sets and prints it.

#### Key Points to Verify:
- **Heap Usage**: The use of a min-heap ensures that the smallest value in the current window of size `d` is efficiently accessed and updated.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation in `func_1` seems to correctly reflect the cost of placing supports based on the given rules.
- **Total Cost Calculation**: The logic in `func_2` to calculate the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows appears to be correct.
- **Boundary Conditions**: The solution handles the boundary conditions (first and last columns having depth 0) appropriately.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the solution seems to correctly implement the required functionality. The logic in both functions aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
