### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic for calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The function starts by setting the first element of `row` to 1 and then increments each of the next `d-1` elements by 2. This part seems to be an initialization step and does not directly relate to the main logic of finding the minimum cost.
2. **Heap Initialization**: A min-heap is initialized with the first `d` elements of the row. This is a good start for finding the minimum cost, as we need to keep track of the minimum values.
3. **Heap Operations**: The function then iterates through the remaining elements of the row, updating each element based on the minimum value found in the heap. However, the logic here is flawed. The function does not ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Instead, it simply adds the minimum value from the heap to the current element and pushes the updated value back into the heap. This approach does not guarantee the optimal placement of supports.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and then reads the depths of the river cells for each row.
2. **Cost Calculation**: It calls `func_1` for each row and stores the results in the `costs` list. This part is correct in terms of calling the function, but the function itself is flawed.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: The function then calculates the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list and finds the minimum of these sums. Again, this part is correct in terms of the logic, but the `func_1` function is not correctly implemented.

Given the analysis, the `func_1` function does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports. The provided example in the original assessment demonstrates this flaw. The function does not ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`, and it does not find the optimal placement of supports to minimize the total cost.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges.
