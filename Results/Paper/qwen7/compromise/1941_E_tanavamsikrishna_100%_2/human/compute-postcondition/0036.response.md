Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `d` remains the same, and the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`**

The `pass` statement does not perform any operation or assignment, so the values of the variables remain unchanged. The precondition that the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1` is still valid.
