Output State: The `min_heap` is empty or contains elements where the second value of each element is greater than `i - (d + 2)`.

Explanation: Since the loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in `min_heap` whose second value is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, once these elements are removed, no further elements will satisfy the condition. Therefore, after the loop completes all its iterations, `min_heap` will either be empty or contain elements where the second value is strictly greater than `i - (d + 2)`.
