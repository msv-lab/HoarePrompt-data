Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is given as `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`. This means the loop continues as long as the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
   - `d` remains the same.
   - The value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
   - Given that `i` is now `i_prev + 1`, the new condition becomes: the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `(i_prev + 1) - (d + 2)`, which simplifies to `i_prev - d - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must still be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1` for the loop to continue.
   - The value of `i` should be adjusted to `i_prev + 1` for the next iteration.
   - The value of `d` remains the same.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`i` must be `i_prev + 1`, `d` remains the same, and the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`**.
