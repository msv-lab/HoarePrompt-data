Output State: **The loop continues to execute as long as `heappop(min_heap)[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. After all iterations, `i` will be greater than or equal to `d + 3` and the loop terminates when no further elements in `min_heap` satisfy the condition `heappop(min_heap)[1] <= i - (d - 2)`.**

In simpler terms, the loop will keep running until there are no more elements in `min_heap` that meet the condition `heappop(min_heap)[1] <= i - (d + 2)`. Once this condition is no longer satisfied, the loop stops, and the final state of `i` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `d + 3`.
