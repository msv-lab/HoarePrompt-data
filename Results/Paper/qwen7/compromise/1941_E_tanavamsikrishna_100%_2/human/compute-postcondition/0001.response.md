Output State: **`rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, and `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers with 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 100, 3 ≤ `m` ≤ 2⋅10^5, and 1 ≤ `d` ≤ `m`.**

Explanation: The code reads input from the user and constructs the `rows` list. Each element in `rows` is a list of integers (depths of river cells), and the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged. The precondition that `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers, and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0, is still valid. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are also preserved as integers within their specified ranges.
