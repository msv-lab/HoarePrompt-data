Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`.
   - This means the loop will continue as long as the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

2. **Determine the relevant states**:
   - `i` is defined as `i_prev + 1`.
   - `d` remains the same.
   - `min_heap` is a heap from which elements are being popped.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
   - Since `i` is `i_prev + 1`, the condition becomes `e[1] <= (i_prev + 1) - (d + 2)`, which simplifies to `e[1] <= i_prev - d - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` satisfies the condition `e[1] <= i_prev - d - 1`.
   - The state right before the loop is that `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `d` remains the same, and `min_heap` contains elements such that the first popped element's `[1]` index satisfies the condition.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that the first popped element from `min_heap` meets the condition `e[1] <= i_prev - d - 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `d` remains the same, and the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`**.
