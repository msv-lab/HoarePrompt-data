Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop condition is: `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `i` must be `i_prev + 1`
  - `d` remains the same
  - The value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`

### Loop Head Analysis
- The loop pops an element from `min_heap` and checks if the second element of the tuple (`e[1]`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

### Current States
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`
- `d` remains the same
- `min_heap` has an element where the second element is less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`

### Next Iteration Condition
- For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `(e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)` must be true.
- This means the new value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must satisfy the condition.

### Adjusting the States
- Since `i` is `i_prev + 1`, the new `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.
- The value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must now be less than or equal to `(i_prev + 1) - (d + 2)`, which simplifies to `i_prev - d - 1`.

### Conclusion
- The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` to ensure it satisfies the condition for the next iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` must be `i_prev + 2`, `d` remains the same, and the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`**
