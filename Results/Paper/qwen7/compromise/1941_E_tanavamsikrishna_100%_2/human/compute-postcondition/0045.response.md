Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 3`, `d` remains the same, the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, and `e` is pushed into `min_heap`, and `(row[i], i)` is pushed into `min_heap`.**

Explanation: The code pushes the tuple `(row[i], i)` into the `min_heap`. Since `i` is `i_prev + 3`, `d` remains the same, the value popped from `min_heap` at index `[1]` must be less than or equal to `i_prev - d - 1`, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, and `e` is pushed into `min_heap`, these conditions remain unchanged. The new condition added is that `(row[i], i)` is now also in `min_heap`.
