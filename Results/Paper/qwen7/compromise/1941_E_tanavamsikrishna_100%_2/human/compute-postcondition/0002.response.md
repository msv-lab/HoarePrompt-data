Output State: **`rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells; `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `costs` by applying the function `func_1(row, d)` to each row in the `rows` list. The function `func_1` is applied with `d` as one of its arguments, and the result is stored in the corresponding position in the `costs` list. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged, and the structure of the `rows` list remains the same.
