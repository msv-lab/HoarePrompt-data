Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates `ans` as `n` and then adds a value based on a loop that does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement. 

To illustrate, let's consider a specific case: `n = 10` and `m = 10`.

According to the problem, we need to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Let's manually check a few pairs for `n = 10` and `m = 10`:

- For `(1, 1)`: `1 + 1 = 2`, and `2` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(1, 1) = 1`. This pair is valid.
- For `(2, 1)`: `2 + 1 = 3`, and `3` is not a multiple of `1 * gcd(2, 1) = 1`. This pair is invalid.
- For `(2, 2)`: `2 + 2 = 4`, and `4` is a multiple of `2 * gcd(2, 2) = 2`. This pair is valid.
- For `(3, 1)`: `3 + 1 = 4`, and `4` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(3, 1) = 1`. This pair is valid.
- For `(4, 1)`: `4 + 1 = 5`, and `5` is not a multiple of `1 * gcd(4, 1) = 1`. This pair is invalid.
- For `(5, 1)`: `5 + 1 = 6`, and `6` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(5, 1) = 1`. This pair is valid.
- For `(6, 1)`: `6 + 1 = 7`, and `7` is not a multiple of `1 * gcd(6, 1) = 1`. This pair is invalid.
- For `(6, 2)`: `6 + 2 = 8`, and `8` is a multiple of `2 * gcd(6, 2) = 2`. This pair is valid.
- For `(6, 3)`: `6 + 3 = 9`, and `9` is a multiple of `3 * gcd(6, 3) = 3`. This pair is valid.
- For `(7, 1)`: `7 + 1 = 8`, and `8` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(7, 1) = 1`. This pair is valid.
- For `(8, 1)`: `8 + 1 = 9`, and `9` is not a multiple of `1 * gcd(8, 1) = 1`. This pair is invalid.
- For `(9, 1)`: `9 + 1 = 10`, and `10` is a multiple of `1 * gcd(9, 1) = 1`. This pair is valid.
- For `(10, 1)`: `10 + 1 = 11`, and `11` is not a multiple of `1 * gcd(10, 1) = 1`. This pair is invalid.

From this manual check, we can see that the program does not correctly count the valid pairs. For instance, the program incorrectly counts `(2, 1)` as valid, which it is not according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
