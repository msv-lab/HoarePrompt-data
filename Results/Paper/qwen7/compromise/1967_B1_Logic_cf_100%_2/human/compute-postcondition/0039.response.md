Output State: `ans` is equal to the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`, inclusive, and `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of expressions `(n + b) // (b * b)` for every `b` starting from 2 up to the minimum value between `n` and `m`, including `min(n, m)`. The variable `b` will be set to one value beyond the last iteration, which is `min(n, m) + 1`.
