Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ans` is equal to `ans` + (n + 2) // (2 * 2)
- `b` is 2
- `m` must be a valid integer

### Loop Statement
```
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `b = 2` to `b = min(n, m)`.
2. **Current Value of `b`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 2.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
4. **Condition Check**: The loop will continue as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.

### Adjusting the States
- **`b`**: Since the loop increments `b` by 1, the new value of `b` will be 3.
- **`n` and `m`**: The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but they must still satisfy the condition `b <= min(n, m)`.

### Final State
Since `b` is incremented by 1 and the loop continues as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `b`.

**State: **`ans` is equal to `ans` + (n + 2) // (2 * 2), `b` is 3, `m` must be a valid integer**
