Output State: **`ans` is increased by the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each value of `b` from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\), `b` is \(\min(n, m) + 2\), `n` and `m` are converted to integers from their respective string values.**

Explanation: The code first converts `n` and `m` from their string representations to integers. The values of `ans` and `b` remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `b` is set to \(\min(n, m) + 2\) and the list `[n, m]` is updated to contain the integer values of the original string inputs.
