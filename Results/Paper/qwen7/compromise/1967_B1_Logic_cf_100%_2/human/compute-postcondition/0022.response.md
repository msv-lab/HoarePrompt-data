Output State: **`ans` is increased by (n + b) // (b * b) + (n + b) // (b * b), `b` is `k + 1` where `k` is the previous value of `b` and must be within the range 2 to min(n, m) + 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. The value of `b` is updated to `k + 1`, where `k` is the previous value of `b`. The initial state of `ans` being increased by `(n + b) // (b * b)` remains true, and now it is increased by the same amount again. The condition for `b` remains the same, i.e., `b` is `k + 1` where `k` is the previous value of `b` and must be within the range 2 to min(n, m) + 1.
