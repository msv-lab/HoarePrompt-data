Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `b` is 2, `n` and `m` must be such that `min(n, m) >= 2`, `ans` is `ans + (n + 2) // (2 * 2)`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given that `b` is 2, the expression simplifies to `(n + 2) // (2 * 2)`, which further simplifies to `(n + 2) // 4`. Since `n` and `m` must satisfy `min(n, m) >= 2`, their exact values are not specified, but `ans` is now updated according to the given formula. The other variables (`t` and `b`) remain unchanged.
