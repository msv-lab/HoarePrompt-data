Output State: `ans` is increased by the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each value of `b` from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\), `b` is \(\min(n, m) + 1\), and `[n, m]` is a list containing the integer values of the split input strings.

In simpler terms, `ans` will be the original value of `n` plus the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for every integer `b` starting from 2 up to the smaller of `n` and `m` inclusive. The variable `b` will take on the final value of \(\min(n, m) + 1\) after the loop completes all its iterations.
