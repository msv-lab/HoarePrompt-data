Output State: **The program returns a dictionary named `frequency_table` where each key is a number from the list `arr` and its value is the maximum occurrence of that number up to `k`. If any number's occurrence exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`.**

This means that the program will return a dictionary where the keys are the unique numbers from the list `arr`, and the values are the highest counts of these numbers, but not exceeding `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in the list, its count will be capped at `k`.
