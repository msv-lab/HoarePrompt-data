You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Example

Input

    5 3

    10 20 30 10 20 40
    
    6 3
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40

Output

    2

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    elif k == n:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It processes the list to create a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a number from `arr` and its value is the maximum occurrence of that number up to `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` is capped at `k`. The function then returns this dictionary.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if `k` is greater than the number of cards, no exchanges can be made.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is also correct because you can exchange all cards in one go, leaving `k - 1` cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table of card numbers.
   - `func_1` correctly calculates the frequency of each card number, ensuring that no frequency exceeds `k`.

4. **Checking for Possible Exchanges:**
   - The program checks if `k` is present as a value in the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`.
   - If `k` is not present as a value in the frequency table, it prints `n`.

### Detailed Check:

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - If `k > n`, the program correctly prints `n`.
  - If `k == n`, the program correctly prints `k - 1`.

- **Frequency Table Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly ensures that no frequency exceeds `k`.

- **Exchanging Logic:**
  - The logic to check if `k` is present as a value in the frequency table is flawed. It does not account for the possibility of having multiple card numbers that can be reduced to `k - 1` through exchanges.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `5 3 4 1 1 4 4`
  - Frequency: `{4: 3, 1: 2}`
  - Since `3` is not in the values, the program incorrectly prints `5`.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `10 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Frequency: `{1: 10}`
  - Since `4` is not in the values, the program incorrectly prints `10`.

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `5 2 3 8 1 48 7`
  - Frequency: `{3: 1, 8: 1, 1: 1, 48: 1, 7: 1}`
  - Since `2` is not in the values, the program incorrectly prints `5`.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum number of cards that can be left. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of reducing the number of cards to `k - 1` when multiple card numbers can be exchanged.
