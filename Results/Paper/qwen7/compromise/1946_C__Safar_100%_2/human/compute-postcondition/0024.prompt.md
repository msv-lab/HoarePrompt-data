Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `stack` contains the tuple (1, 1), `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the tree, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n - 1`, `n` is the number of vertices in the tree, `visited` is a set containing `1`, `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1, `r` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node != p:
        stack.append((node, x))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `g[1]` contains at least one element, `node` is not equal to `p`, and `stack` contains an additional tuple `(node, x)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `g[1]` contains at least one element, `node` is the next element in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`, and the `stack` contains a tuple `(node, x)` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `g[1]` contains at least one element, `node` is the next element in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`, and the `stack` contains a tuple `(node, x)` appended to it. This remains true whether `node` is not equal to `p` or not, as there is no else part to alter these conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
