Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `node` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `g[x]` that are not equal to `p`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g[1]` contains at least one element.
   - `node` is the next element in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`.
   - The `stack` contains a tuple `(node, x)` appended to it.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `node` is the next element in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`, after the current iteration, `node` will be the next element in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`.
   - The `stack` will contain the tuple `(node, x)` appended to it.
   - The `x` value remains the same as it is not being modified within the loop head.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `g[1]` still contains at least one element.
   - `node` will be the next element in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`.
   - The `stack` will contain the tuple `(node, x)` appended to it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`g[1]` contains at least one element, `node` is the next element in `g[x]` that is not equal to `p`, and the `stack` contains a tuple `(node, x)` appended to it.**
