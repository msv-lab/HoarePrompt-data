n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, and k is an integer representing the number of excursions. The friendships is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (a_i, b_i, f_i) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively. The indices a_i and b_i are distinct, and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
