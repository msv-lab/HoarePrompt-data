Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value incorrectly. The logic inside `func_1` does not properly compute the MEX for each prefix of the permutation `p`. Specifically, the program tries to manage the `minn` and `maxx` values to simulate the MEX calculation but fails to do so accurately.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The program updates `minn` and `maxx` based on the values in `arr`, which is not aligned with the actual MEX computation. The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set, and this needs to be computed dynamically as the permutation is built.

3. **Incorrect Output**: The program prints a sequence (`mex`) that is supposed to represent the MEX values but does not construct the permutation `p` correctly. The permutation `p` should satisfy the condition \(a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i\).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to build the permutation `p` step-by-step while ensuring that the MEX condition holds. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [-1] * n  # Initialize permutation with -1
    mex = 0  # Start with MEX = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            p[i] = mex
            mex += 1
        else:
            while p[mex] != -1:  # Find the next available position
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex
            mex += 1

    for item in p:
        print(item, end=' ')
    print()
```

This approach ensures that the permutation `p` is constructed correctly by maintaining the MEX condition.
