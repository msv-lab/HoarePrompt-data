### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if it correctly generates a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The array \( a \) is defined such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The goal is to find a permutation \( p \) that satisfies these conditions.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It reads the input \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \) and constructs the `mex` list based on the conditions:
     - If \( a_i > 0 \), it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \), it appends the absolute difference between `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The logic for calculating `mex` is flawed. The `mex` value should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of \( p \), but the program incorrectly calculates it.
   - The program does not ensure that the generated permutation \( p \) satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 1 -2 1 2
     ```
   - The expected output should be a permutation \( p \) such that:
     - \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}([p_1]) - p_1 = 1 \)
     - \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}([p_1, p_2]) - p_2 = 1 \)
     - \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}([p_1, p_2, p_3]) - p_3 = -2 \)
     - \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}([p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4]) - p_4 = 1 \)
     - \( a_5 = \texttt{MEX}([p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5]) - p_5 = 2 \)
   - A valid permutation \( p \) could be \( [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \), which satisfies the conditions:
     - \( \texttt{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 \)
     - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) - 1 = 1 \)
     - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = -2 \)
     - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 1 \)
     - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 2 \)
   - However, the provided program does not correctly generate this permutation. For instance, if we run the program with the given input, it may produce a different permutation that does not satisfy the conditions.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly generate a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
