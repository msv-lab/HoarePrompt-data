Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the given state, so it should be set to the starting value of the loop, which is 0.
   - `n` is already provided as an input integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5`.

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 0, the condition `i < n` will be true as long as `n` is a positive integer.

Given the constraints and the initial state:
- `minn` is 0 (not relevant for the loop head).
- `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` (not relevant for the loop head).
- `n` is an input integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5`.
- `arr` is a list of integers (not relevant for the loop head).
- `mex` is an empty list (not relevant for the loop head).
- `maxx` is 0 (not relevant for the loop head).

The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5`.

So, the final state is:
**`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5`**.
