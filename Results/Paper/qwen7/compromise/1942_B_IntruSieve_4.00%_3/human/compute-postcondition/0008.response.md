Output State: `minn` is the maximum value between the last updated `minn` and `maxx` + 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is a list containing the values of `minn` for each positive element in `arr`, and `maxx` is the maximum value between the original `maxx` and the differences between elements in `arr` and `minn`.
