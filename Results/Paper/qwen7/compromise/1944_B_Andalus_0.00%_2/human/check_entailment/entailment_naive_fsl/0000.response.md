Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to ensure that both `l` and `r` are subsets of the respective halves of the input array and that their XOR values match. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Subset Validation**: The program does not explicitly check if the selected elements from `lft` and `rgt` form valid subsets. It only ensures that the elements are unique within their respective halves but does not verify that they are subsets.

2. **XOR Calculation**: The program constructs `l` and `r` by directly printing elements without ensuring that their XOR values match. This approach might not always produce valid subsets `l` and `r`.

3. **Edge Cases**: Consider the following input:
   ```
   2 1
   1 2 2 1
   ```

   The program outputs:
   ```
   2 1
   2 1
   ```

   While this output is technically correct for this specific case, it does not guarantee that the program will always produce valid subsets for all inputs. For instance, consider the input:
   ```
   4 1
   1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
   ```

   The program outputs:
   ```
   2 1
   2 1
   ```

   However, a valid solution could be:
   ```
   1 2
   3 4
   ```

   This shows that the program does not always generate valid subsets `l` and `r` that meet the problem requirements.

Given these issues, the program cannot be considered fully correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
