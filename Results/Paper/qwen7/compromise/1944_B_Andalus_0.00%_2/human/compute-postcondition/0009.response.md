Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `lft` is a list containing the sorted elements of `lst` starting from index `n`, `rgt` is a list containing the first `n` elements of `lst`, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `lft.sort()` sorts the list `lft` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `lft` now contains the sorted elements from the original `lst` starting from index `n`.
