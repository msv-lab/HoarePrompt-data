Output State: **`rgt` is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `sng` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `rgt.sort()` sorts the list `rgt` in ascending order. The other variables remain unchanged.
