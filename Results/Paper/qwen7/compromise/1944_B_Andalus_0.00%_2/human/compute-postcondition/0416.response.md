Output State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` plus 2, and `k - sz` is less than or equal to -2**.

Explanation: The value of `sz` is incremented by 2. Since `sz` was initially an integer greater than or equal to `k`, after adding 2, `sz` becomes an integer that is greater than or equal to `k + 2`. Additionally, since `k - sz` was initially greater than or equal to 2, after `sz` increases by 2, the difference `k - sz` decreases by 4, making it less than or equal to -2.
