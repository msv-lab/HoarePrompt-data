Output State: `rdb` must not be empty, `sz` is equal to `k` + n, where `n` is the total number of elements in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `sz` will be equal to `k` plus the total number of elements in `sng`. The loop will continue to print each element from `sng` until either `sz` reaches `k` (which would cause an immediate break) or there are no more elements in `sng`. Since the loop continues until `sz` reaches `k` or `sng` is exhausted, and given that the loop prints all elements of `sng`, `sz` will eventually equal `k` plus the length of `sng`, assuming `sng` is fully iterated over before `sz` reaches `k`.
