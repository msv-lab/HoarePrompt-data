Output State: **`i` is now 1 + 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, and `sng` contains the element `lft[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is initially less than `n - 1`, so after appending, `i` is incremented by 1 (becoming `i + 1`). All other conditions remain unchanged.
