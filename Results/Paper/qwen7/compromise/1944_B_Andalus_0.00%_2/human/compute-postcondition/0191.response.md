State: **`i` is 1, `n` is known but its exact value is not specified, `sng` is an empty list, `ldb` is an empty list, `rgt` retains its state after the last iteration, `rdb` retains its state after the last iteration, `sz` retains its state after the last iteration, `k` retains its state after the last iteration, `lst` retains its state after the last iteration, `lft` retains its state after the last iteration**

Explanation:
- The loop starts with `i` set to 1.
- `n` is known but its exact value is not specified, so we keep it as is.
- `sng` and `ldb` are initialized as empty lists since no elements have been processed yet.
- `rgt`, `rdb`, `sz`, `k`, `lst`, and `lft` retain their state after the last iteration as per the problem description.

This ensures that the loop can start executing with the correct initial conditions for `i` and `n`.
