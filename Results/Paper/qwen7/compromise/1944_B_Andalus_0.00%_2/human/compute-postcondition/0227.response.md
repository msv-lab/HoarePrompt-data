Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sz` is either 2 or 4, depending on whether `k - sz >= 2`.
   - `ldb` is a non-empty list.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for elem in ldb:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `elem`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `ldb`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `ldb`, the state of `ldb` will be reduced by one element per iteration.
   - `sz` and `ldb` are the only variables that need adjustment based on the loop head.

6. **New State After One More Iteration:**
   - `sz` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `ldb` will have one fewer element than before the loop started.

Given this analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `ldb` has one fewer element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`sz` is either 2 or 4, depending on whether `k - sz >= 2`, `ldb` is a non-empty list with one fewer element**.
