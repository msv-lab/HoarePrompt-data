Output State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, the size of `sng` (denoted as sz) is greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sng` or `k`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block was specified in the code, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional structure related to `sng` and `k`.
