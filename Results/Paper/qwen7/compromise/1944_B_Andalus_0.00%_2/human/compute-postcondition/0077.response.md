Based on the initial state and the given code snippet, let's break down the situation:

1. `sz` is an integer that is initially greater than or equal to `k`.
2. There is a conditional check: if `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2; otherwise, `sz` remains unchanged.
3. The code snippet provided is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`.

However, the initial state does not provide any explicit value for `elem`. Since no specific value for `elem` is given, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will consist of two instances of `elem` separated by a space.

Output: **elem elem**
