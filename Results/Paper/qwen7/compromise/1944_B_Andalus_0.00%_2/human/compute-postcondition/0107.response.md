Output State: **`sz` is 0, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of the variables `sz` and `rdb`. It only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently inside. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of `sz` and `rdb` remain unchanged.
