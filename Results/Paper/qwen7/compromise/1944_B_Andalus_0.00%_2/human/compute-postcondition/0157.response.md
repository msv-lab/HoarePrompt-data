Output State: **`rdb` must not be empty, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input, splits them, and converts them to integers. It assigns these values to `n` and `k`. The conditions about `rdb` and `sz` remain unchanged.
