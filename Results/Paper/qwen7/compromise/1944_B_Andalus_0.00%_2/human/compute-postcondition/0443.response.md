Output State: **`sng` must contain at least one element, `sz` is `sz` + 1, and if the size of `sng` (denoted as `sz`) is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code increments the size of `sng` by 1, so `sz` is updated to its original value plus 1. The conditions and postconditions regarding `sng` and `k` remain unchanged.
