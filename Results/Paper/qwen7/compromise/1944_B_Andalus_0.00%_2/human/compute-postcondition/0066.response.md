Output State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sz` or `k`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Since no such block is mentioned in the given code snippet, the only effect is that the program would break out of the most internal loop or if statement it was in.
