Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `ldb` is a list with the element `lft[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but since the initial state only mentions that `i` is `i + 1`, we keep it as `i` is `i + 1`. The list `ldb` is updated by appending `lft[i]` to it.
