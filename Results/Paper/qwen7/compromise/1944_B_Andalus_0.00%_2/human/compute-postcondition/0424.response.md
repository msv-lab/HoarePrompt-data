Output State: **`sz` is exactly `k - 2` and is now `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: Initially, `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`. If `sz` was initially greater than or equal to `k - 2`, it is now exactly `k - 2`. After executing `sz += 2`, `sz` becomes `k`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, as mentioned in the precondition.
