Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, and the condition `lft[i] != lft[i - 1]` holds true. Additionally, if `i < n - 1` and `lft[i] != lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` now contains the element `lft[i]` at the last appended position. If the condition `i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]` does not hold, then `sng` remains unchanged.
