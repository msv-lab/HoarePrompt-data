The `sort()` method sorts the elements of a list in-place. Since `rgt` is an empty list (`[]`), sorting an empty list does not change it. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sng` is an empty iterable, `elem` is the last element in an empty iterable (which is `elem` itself), `sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 1 (which is 1), `rdb` is now `['']`, `ldb` is an empty list, `lft` is an empty list, `rgt` is an empty list.**
