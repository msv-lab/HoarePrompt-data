Output State: `sng` is an empty iterable, `elem` is the last element from the original `sng`, `sz` is equal to `k`, and `rdb` is an empty iterable.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop condition `sz < k` and `k - sz >= 2` will no longer be satisfied. This means `sz` has reached `k`, and since the loop increments `sz` by 1 each time, it will eventually reach `k`. At this point, there are no more elements left to process in `sng` because the loop stops when `sz` is no longer less than `k` or `k - sz` is less than 2. Therefore, `elem` will be the last element from the original `sng`, and `rdb` will be an empty iterable since all elements have been processed.
