Postcondition: `i` is an integer such that `1 â‰¤ i < n`, `sng` is a list containing at most one element which is `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i-1]` and `lft[i+1]`, `n` is greater than 1, `rgt` is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i + 1]` if `i < n - 1`.
