Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `sng`. The variable `elem` is used to iterate over each element in `sng`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `sz` is incremented by 1. This means that `sz` was incremented during the loop body, but it does not directly affect the loop condition.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must still contain at least one element. Since `elem` is used to iterate over `sng`, `sng` must have at least one more element after the current iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**: The only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `elem` and `sng`. After the previous iteration, `sz` was incremented, but we don't know the exact value of `sz`. We only know that `sng` must have at least one more element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `sng` must have at least one more element.

**State: **`sz` is incremented by 1, `sng` must have at least one more element**
