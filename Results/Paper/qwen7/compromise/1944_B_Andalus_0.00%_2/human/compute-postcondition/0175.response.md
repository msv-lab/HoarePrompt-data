Postcondition: **`i` is increased by 1, `sng` is a list containing either `lft[i]` (if `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`), or `lft[i]` is added to `sng` (if `lft[i]` does not equal `lft[i - 1]`). `n` is greater than 1, `rgt` is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `sng` is a list containing unique elements from `lft` starting from index `i`.**
