Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for elem in sng:`. The variables involved in this loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `sz` is 4 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't affect the loop execution).
   - `sng` is a non-empty iterable (this means there are elements left in `sng`).
   - `elem` is the second element of `sng` (this means the first element has already been processed).

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute Again**: For the loop to execute again, `sng` must still be a non-empty iterable, and `elem` should be the third element of `sng` (since the second element has already been processed).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `sng` remains a non-empty iterable (it must still have elements left).
- `elem` becomes the third element of `sng`.

Given these points, the updated state is:

**State: `sz` is 4, `sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the third element of `sng`**
