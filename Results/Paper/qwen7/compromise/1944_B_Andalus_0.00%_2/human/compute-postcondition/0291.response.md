Based on the initial state provided:

- `sng` is a non-empty iterable.
- `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The print statement is `print(elem, end=' ')`.

Given that `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, and no specific value or formula is provided for it, we can only infer that `elem` refers to an element from the iterable `sng`. Since the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, it implies that `elem` is the last element accessed or evaluated within that loop or if statement.

Therefore, the print statement will output the last element of the iterable `sng`.

Output: **last element of sng**
