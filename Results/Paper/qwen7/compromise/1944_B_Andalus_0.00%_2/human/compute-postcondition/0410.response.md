Output State: **`sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the only effect is that the execution would exit the current loop or conditional structure. The initial conditions for `sz` and `k` remain unchanged.
