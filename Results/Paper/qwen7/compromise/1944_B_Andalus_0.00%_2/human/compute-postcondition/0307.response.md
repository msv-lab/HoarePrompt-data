Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `sng` is a non-empty iterable.
   - `elem` is the last element in `sng`.
   - `sz` is equal to the length of `sng`.
   - `rdb` is an empty iterable because there are no elements left to process after the loop has completed.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for _ in range(T):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `T` times.
   - Each iteration of the loop processes one element from `sng`.
   - The variable `sz` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop stops when `sz` is no longer less than `k` or `k - sz` is less than 2.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `range(T)`, the only variables that change within the loop head are `sz` and `rdb`.
   - `elem` is updated to the last element in `sng` at the end of the loop, but it does not change during the loop itself.
   - `rdb` remains empty since no elements are added to it within the loop.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `sz` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `rdb` will still be empty.

Given that `sz` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, and `rdb` remains empty, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `sng` remains a non-empty iterable (since it is not modified within the loop).
- `elem` remains the last element in `sng` (since it is not modified within the loop).
- `sz` is incremented by 1.
- `rdb` remains an empty iterable.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` is the last element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 1, and `rdb` is an empty iterable**.
