Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`; `sng` is a list with an additional element `lft[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sng.append(lft[i])` appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Since `i` is already `i + 1` in the initial state, the value of `i` remains `i + 1` after the operation. The list `sng` gains an additional element, which is `lft[i]`.
