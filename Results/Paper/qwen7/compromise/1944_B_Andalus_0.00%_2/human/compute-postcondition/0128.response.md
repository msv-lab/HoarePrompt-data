Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` remains 2, meaning `sz` is currently 2.
- `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element than it had before the current iteration started, implying that `rdb` has been modified during some previous iteration, but the current state does not specify the exact elements of `rdb`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or iteration.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `rdb` is a non-empty iterable, `elem` could be any element from `rdb`, but without more specific information about `elem`, we cannot determine its exact value.

Given the lack of explicit value for `elem`, the most precise description we can provide is that `elem` is an element from the iterable `rdb`.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is an element from the iterable rdb)**
