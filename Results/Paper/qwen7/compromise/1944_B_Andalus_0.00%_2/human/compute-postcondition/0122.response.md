Output State: **`sz` is 4, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable with one less element, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 2 to 4. The variable `rdb` remains unchanged as it is described as a non-empty iterable with one less element. Additionally, the condition regarding the comparison between `sz` and `k` (if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement) also remains unchanged.
