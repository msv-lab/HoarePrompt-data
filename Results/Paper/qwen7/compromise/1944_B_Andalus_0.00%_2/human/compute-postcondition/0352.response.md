Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4, the value of `rgt[1]` is equal to the value of `rgt[0]`, and `rdb` now contains the values `[rgt[0], rgt[0], rgt[3]]`**

Explanation: The code `rdb.append(rgt[i])` appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 3, `rdb` which initially contains `[rgt[0], rgt[0]]` will now become `[rgt[0], rgt[0], rgt[3]]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
