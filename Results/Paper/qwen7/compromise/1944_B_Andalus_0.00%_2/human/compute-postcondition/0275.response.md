Postcondition: `sz` is either 2 or 0, `sng` is a fully iterated iterable, `elem` is the next element of `rdb`, `rdb` is an iterable with at least one element, and the value of `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is set to 4. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.
