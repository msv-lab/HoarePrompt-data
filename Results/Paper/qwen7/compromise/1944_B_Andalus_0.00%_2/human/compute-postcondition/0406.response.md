Based on the initial state described, the precondition tells us that all elements in `ldb` have been processed, and `sz` is equal to the value it had when the loop started plus the total number of elements processed in `sng` (which is less than `k`). No further elements are printed after the loop.

Given this, the `print()` statement will simply print an empty line since there are no specific values or strings to print.

Output: **an empty line**
