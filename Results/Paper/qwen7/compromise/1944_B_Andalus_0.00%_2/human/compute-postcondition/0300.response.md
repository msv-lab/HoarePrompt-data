Output State: **`sng` is a non-empty iterable (excluding the first element), `elem` is the next element in `sng`, `sz` is equal to the original value of `sz` plus 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sng`, `elem`, or `sz`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
