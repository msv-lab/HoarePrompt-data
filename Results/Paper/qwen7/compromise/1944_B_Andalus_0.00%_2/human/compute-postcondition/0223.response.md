Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 2.
- `ldb` is a non-empty list.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print two instances of `elem` followed by a space. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Since `elem` is not defined in the given initial state, we cannot determine its exact value.

Given this, the output will be two identical values separated by a space, but we do not know what those values are.

Output: **elem elem**
