Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either `1` or `2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `1`.
   - `ldb` is equal to `lft[i]` if `i` is `1`.
   - `ldb` is equal to `lft[i]` if `i` is `2`, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `lft[i + 1]`.
   - `sng` contains the element `lft[i]`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` is `1`, then `i` will be incremented to `2`.
   - If `i` is `2`, then `i` will be incremented to `3`.
   - In both cases, `n` must remain the same because it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - Since `i` is either `1` or `2`, after the next iteration, `i` will be `2` or `3` respectively.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than `1`.
   - `ldb` will be updated based on the new value of `i`:
     - If `i` becomes `2`, `ldb` will be equal to `lft[2]` and must satisfy the condition `lft[2] != lft[1]` and `lft[2] != lft[3]`.
   - `sng` will contain the element `lft[i]` for the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ldb` is equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[2] != lft[1]` and `lft[2] != lft[3]` if `i` is 2, and `sng` contains the element `lft[2]` if `i` is 2, and `ldb` is equal to `lft[3]` and `lft[3] != lft[2]` and `lft[3] != lft[4]` if `i` is 3, and `sng` contains the element `lft[3]` if `i` is 3**.
