Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` can be any positive integer, `rdb` contains all the elements of `rgt` starting from index 1 up to `n-1` if they are repeated consecutively from the previous element, and the other variables (`ldb`, `sng`, `lft`, `rgt`) remain in their initial states or as described in the initial state condition.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has processed every index from 1 to `n-1`. The list `rdb` will contain all elements from `rgt` starting from index 1 up to `n-1` if these elements are the same as the previous element in `rgt`. The lists `ldb`, `sng`, `lft`, and `rgt` will retain their initial or unchanged states according to the problem description.
