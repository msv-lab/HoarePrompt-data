Postcondition: **`i` is increased by 1, `sng` is a list containing `lft[i]`, `n` is greater than 1, `rgt` is now sorted in ascending order, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sz` must be less than `k` + `n`, `k` is the second integer from the input, `n` is the first integer from the input, `lst` is a list of integers from the input, `lft` is the first `n` elements of `lst` sorted in ascending order, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`**.

This postcondition summarizes that if `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `sng` is updated to include `lft[i]`. If the condition is not met, the values remain unchanged as specified in the if part.
