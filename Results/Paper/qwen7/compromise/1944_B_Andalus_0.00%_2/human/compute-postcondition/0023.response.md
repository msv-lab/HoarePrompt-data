Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ldb` is now equal to `lft[i]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i-1]` and `lft[i+1]` if `i` is 2, and `sng` still contains the element `lft[2]` if `i` is 2, and `ldb` is now equal to `lft[i]` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i-1]` and `lft[i+1]` if `i` is 3, and `sng` still contains the element `lft[3]` if `i` is 3.**

Explanation:
- The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`.
- The value of `i` remains 2 or 3.
- The condition `n > 1` remains true.
- For `i` being 2, `ldb` is updated to `lft[2]` and `sng` still contains `lft[2]`.
- For `i` being 3, `ldb` is updated to `lft[3]` and `sng` still contains `lft[3]`.
- The conditions `lft[i] != lft[i-1]` and `lft[i] != lft[i+1]` remain true for the respective indices.
