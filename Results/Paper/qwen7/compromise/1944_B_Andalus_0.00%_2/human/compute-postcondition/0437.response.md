Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for elem in sng`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `sng`. Once `sng` is empty, the loop will terminate.

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - All elements in `ldb` have been processed.
   - `sz` is equal to or greater than `k`.
   - `rdb` is empty.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `sng` must contain at least one element. The current state does not provide information about `sng`, so we need to ensure that `sng` is not empty.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above analysis, we need to ensure that `sng` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. The other variables (`ldb`, `sz`, and `rdb`) do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`sng` must contain at least one element**
