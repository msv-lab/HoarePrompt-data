Based on the initial state provided:

- `rdb` is not empty.
- `sz` has reached the value of `k`.

The print statement is `print(elem, end=' ')`.

Since `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, and there's no additional context about where `elem` comes from, we need to infer its value. Given that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when `sz` reaches the value of `k`, it suggests that `elem` is likely the last element processed in the loop or the element corresponding to `sz == k`.

However, without more specific details about how `elem` is determined, the most precise answer we can give is that `elem` is the element associated with `sz == k`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the element corresponding to sz == k)**
