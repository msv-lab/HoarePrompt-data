Output State: `sz` is 2, `rdb` is an empty iterable, and no more elements will be printed because the loop has either already executed its full cycle or the condition `sz >= k` was met during the iterations.

Explanation: Given that the loop breaks when `sz >= k`, and considering that `sz` can only increment by 2 each time (as long as `k - sz >= 2`), the loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `rdb` and the condition `k - sz >= 2` holds true. After the loop has executed all possible iterations without breaking due to `sz >= k`, `rdb` would be exhausted (i.e., empty), and `sz` would still be 2 since it cannot exceed `k`.
