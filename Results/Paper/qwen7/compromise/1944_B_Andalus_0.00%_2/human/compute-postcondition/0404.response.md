Output State: All elements in `sng` have been processed, `sz` is equal to `len(sng)`, and no further elements are printed.

This output state occurs because the loop continues to increment `sz` and print elements from `sng` until either `sz` reaches the length of `sng` or `sz` becomes greater than or equal to `k`, at which point the loop breaks. Since we are considering the scenario where the loop executes all iterations, it means that `sz` will eventually equal the length of `sng`, indicating that all elements have been processed, and the loop will break, preventing any further elements from being printed.
