State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000, `_` is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `T` is mentioned as an input integer that is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000. This is a necessary condition for the loop to execute.
- The variable `_` is used as a loop counter in the `range(T)` function. Initially, `_` is set to 0 when the loop starts. After the first iteration, `_` will be incremented to 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `T` is within the specified range and `_` is set to 1 for the loop to begin its first iteration.
