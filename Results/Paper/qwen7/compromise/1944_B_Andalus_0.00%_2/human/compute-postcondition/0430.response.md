Postcondition: `sz` is an integer greater than or equal to `k`, and `rdb` must still contain at least one element. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `sz` is not greater than or equal to `k`, no change occurs to the conditions of `sz` and `rdb`.
