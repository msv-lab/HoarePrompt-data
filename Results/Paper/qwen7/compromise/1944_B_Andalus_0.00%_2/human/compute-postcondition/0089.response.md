Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for` loop iterating over `elem` in `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there is at least one element in `sng` that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `sng` contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`.
   - `sz` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `sz` is increased by 1, the new value of `sz` will be the old value plus 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `sng` must still contain at least one element that satisfies the condition `k <= sz < n`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `sz` and ensure that `sng` still meets the condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sng` is a sequence that contains at least one element that can be assigned to `sz` such that `k <= sz < n`, `sz` is increased by 1**.

This means `sz` is now `sz + 1`, and `sng` must still contain an element that satisfies the condition `k <= (sz + 1) < n`.
