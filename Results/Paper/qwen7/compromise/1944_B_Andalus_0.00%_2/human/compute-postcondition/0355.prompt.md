Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `ldb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`. `sng` will contain all unique elements from `lft` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, provided they are not followed by the same element or are the last element in `lft`. `rdb` remains as `['']`, `lft` contains the original elements from the input, `rgt` remains empty, and `ldb` and `sng` are populated based on the conditions specified in the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, the value of `rgt[i]` (which is `rgt[1]`) is equal to the value of `rgt[0]`, and `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, the value of `rgt[1]` is equal to the value of `rgt[0]`, and `rdb` now contains the values `[rgt[0], rgt[0]]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4, the value of `rgt[1]` is equal to the value of `rgt[0]`, and `rdb` now contains the values `[rgt[0], rgt[0], rgt[3]]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
