Output State: **`i` is 3 or 4, `n` must be greater than 1, `ldb` is equal to `lft[3]`, followed by `lft[i]`, and `lft[3]` is not equal to `lft[2]` and `lft[4]`, and `sng` contains the elements `lft[3]` and `lft[4]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Since `i` is either 3 or 4, `ldb` will now contain `lft[3]` followed by `lft[i]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
