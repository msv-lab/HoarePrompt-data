Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 0.
- `ldb` is a non-empty list.
- `(k - sz)` is greater than or equal to 2.

However, the print statement only references `elem`, but there is no explicit definition of `elem` in the initial state. Since `elem` is not defined, we cannot determine its value from the given information.

Given this, the print statement will simply output `elem` twice, followed by a space, without any additional context or values.

Output: **elem elem**
