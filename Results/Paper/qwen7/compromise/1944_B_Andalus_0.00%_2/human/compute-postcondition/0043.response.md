Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - The postcondition states that if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then the value of `rdb` is equal to the list containing the value of `rgt[i-1]`.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`
   - This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

6. **Postcondition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The postcondition needs to be checked for `i = 3`.
   - The condition is `if rgt[3] == rgt[2]`, and if true, `rdb` should be set to `[rgt[2]]`.

7. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to adjust the state of `i` and `n` for the next iteration.
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

8. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
   - The postcondition for `i = 3` will be checked in the next iteration.

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
