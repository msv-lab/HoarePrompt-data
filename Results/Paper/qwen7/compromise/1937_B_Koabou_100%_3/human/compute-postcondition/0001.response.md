Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are given, where each `a_{ij}` is either 0 or 1; list `a` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `t`, the two binary strings, and the list `a` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` as an input integer, along with the original conditions for `t`, the binary strings, and the list `a`.
