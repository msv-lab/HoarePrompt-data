Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an empty list.
   - `x` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop `for i in range(n - 1):` will execute if `n - 1` is a positive integer.
   - This means `n - 1 > 0`, which simplifies to `n > 1`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that the loop can execute, so `n` must be greater than 1.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0 because `range(n - 1)` starts from 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `s` is an empty list, `x` is 0, `y` is 0**
