Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `s`:**
   - The code attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest string `s` by checking conditions on the characters of the two binary strings. However, the logic for constructing `s` is flawed. Specifically, the code does not handle cases where both conditions (`a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'`) and (`a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`) do not hold true for any `i`. In such cases, the current implementation constructs `s` incorrectly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Paths:**
   - The calculation of the number of paths `t` is also incorrect. The code assumes that if a substring of `a[1]` matches a corresponding substring of `s`, then the number of paths is simply the length of the matching substring. This is not correct because the grasshopper can move in two directions (downwards or right), and the paths must follow the grid constraints.

3. **Missing Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the entire first row is '0' or the entire second row is '1', or when the first character of the first row is '1' and the first character of the second row is '0'. These cases need special handling to ensure the lexicographically smallest string is constructed correctly.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
