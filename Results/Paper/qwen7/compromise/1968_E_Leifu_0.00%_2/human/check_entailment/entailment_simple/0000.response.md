Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of \( n \).
2. For \( n = 2 \), the program prints:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   ```
   This results in a set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct.

3. For \( n = 3 \), the program prints:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   2 3
   ```
   This results in a set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is also correct.

4. For \( n > 3 \), the program prints:
   - `1 1`
   - `1 2`
   - `2 4`
   - For \( j \) from 4 to \( n \), it prints `j j`.

   Let's verify this for \( n = 4 \):
   - Points: `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`
   - Distances:
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 3 \)
     - Between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: \( |1-4| + |1-4| = 6 \)
     - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 3 \)
     - Between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`: \( |1-4| + |2-4| = 5 \)
     - Between `(2, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: \( |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 \)
   - Set of distances: \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6\}\), which is correct.

   Similarly, for larger \( n \), the distances will cover a wide range, ensuring that the maximum number of unique Manhattan distances is achieved.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles the problem for all given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
