You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print('1 1')
        print('1 2')
        if n == 3:
            print('2 3')
        else:
            print('2 4')
            for j in range(4, n + 1):
                print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each test case, it prints a sequence of pairs of integers. Specifically, it always prints '1 1' and '1 2'. Depending on the value of `n`, it may print additional pairs, including '2 3' if `n` is 3, and pairs 'j j' for `j` ranging from 4 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) and higher values of \(n\). 

For \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 3
```
However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should include three cells such that the Manhattan distances are maximized. A better arrangement would be:
```
1 1
2 1
3 1
```
This arrangement gives the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which has a size of 3. The program only outputs two cells, resulting in a smaller set of distances.

For \(n > 3\), the program's approach also fails to maximize the set of Manhattan distances. For example, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
```
A better arrangement for \(n = 4\) would be:
```
1 1
2 1
3 1
4 1
```
This arrangement gives the set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. The program's output does not achieve this maximum size.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).
