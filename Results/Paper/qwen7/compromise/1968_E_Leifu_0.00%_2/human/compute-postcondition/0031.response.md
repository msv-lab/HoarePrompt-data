Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and the range `4` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `4` to `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, and `t` must be greater than 1.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 4 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 5.
   - The condition `n > 4` remains the same.
   - The variable `t` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `j` is 5**
