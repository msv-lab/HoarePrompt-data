Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(4, n + 1)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `j` is less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, and `t` must be greater than 2.

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `j` starts from 4 (inclusive) and goes up to `n` (inclusive), for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so `j` will start from 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be 4 and `n` must still be at least 4.

4. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains greater than 2 because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` remains 2 because it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` must still be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4**
