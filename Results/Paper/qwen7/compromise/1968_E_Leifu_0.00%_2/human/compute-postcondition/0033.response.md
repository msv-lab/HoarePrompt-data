Output State: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 7, `j` is 8.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 4` to `j = n`. After 3 iterations, `j` is 5. Therefore, the loop will continue until `j` reaches `n`, which means the loop will run until `n` is greater than 7 (since it starts from 4 and increments by 1 each iteration). Once the loop finishes, `j` will be `n + 1`, but since the loop stops right before `j` exceeds `n`, `j` will be `n` itself, which is greater than 7 in this case.
