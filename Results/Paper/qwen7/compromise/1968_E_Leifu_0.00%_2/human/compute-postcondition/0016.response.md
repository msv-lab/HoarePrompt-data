Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `j` must be less than `n + 1` and equal to `j + 1`.

2. **Analyze the Conditions**:
   - For `j` to be less than `n + 1` and equal to `j + 1`, the only possible value for `j` is 0. This is because if `j` were any positive number, then `j + 1` would be a different number, violating the condition that `j` equals `j + 1`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`.
   - Since `j` is determined to be 0, the statement becomes `print(str(0) + ' ' + str(0))`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The expression `str(0) + ' ' + str(0)` results in the string `"0 0"`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **"0 0"**
