The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` must be greater than 1, but `t` itself is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer, but its value is not specified and is not used in the print statement.
- `i` must be 1, but it is also not used in the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'2 3'`.

Output: **2 3**
