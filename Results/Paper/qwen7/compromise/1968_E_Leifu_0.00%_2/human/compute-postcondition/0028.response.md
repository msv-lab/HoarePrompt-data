Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `i` must be 1

The code snippet is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

However, there is no information about the value of `j`. Since `j` is not defined in the initial state and there is no way to infer its value from the given information, we cannot determine the exact value of `j`.

Therefore, the output will include the value of `j` twice, but we cannot specify what those values are.

Output: **[j] [j]** (where [j] represents the value of the undefined variable `j`)
