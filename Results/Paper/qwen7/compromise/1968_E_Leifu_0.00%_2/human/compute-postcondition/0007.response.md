The initial state provides the following information:
- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` equals 3.
- `i` is 0.

The `print('2 3')` statement simply prints the string `'2 3'`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` do not affect this particular print statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Output: **2 3**
