Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be at least 4.

However, the variables `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since no value or formula for `j` is given, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will include the string representation of `j` twice.

Output: **str(j) str(j)**
