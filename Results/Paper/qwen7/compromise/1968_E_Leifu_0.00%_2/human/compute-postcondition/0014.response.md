Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

The `print` statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`. 

Here, `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then again with the string representation of `j`. Therefore, the output will be the string representation of `j` followed by a space and then the same string representation of `j`.

Since the exact value of `j` is not specified, it can be any integer less than `n + 1`, but we know `n > 3`, so `j < n + 1` implies `j` can be any integer from 4 up to `n`.

Thus, the output will be the string representation of `j` repeated twice, separated by a space.

Output: **[j] [j]** (where [j] is any integer less than `n + 1` and `n > 3`)
