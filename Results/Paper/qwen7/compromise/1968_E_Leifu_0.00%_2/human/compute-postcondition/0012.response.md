Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is 0.

The `print` statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`. 

From the initial state, there is no explicit value given for `j`. Since `j` is not defined or mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will include `j` as it is, repeated twice with a space in between.

Output: **j j**
