Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` must be greater than 2, `i` will be equal to `t-1`, and `j` will be equal to the final value of `n` for the last iteration. If `n` is exactly 3 during the last iteration, then `j` will be 3. Otherwise, `j` will be equal to the final value of `n` which is at least 4.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` will hold the total number of iterations performed, which is a value greater than 2. The variable `i` will be one less than `t` because it starts from 0. The variable `j` will be set to the value of `n` from the last iteration of the loop, which could be any integer from 4 up to the maximum allowed value (10^3), depending on the inputs provided during each iteration.
