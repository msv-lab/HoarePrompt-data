Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two integers, t and n, where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. Based on these values, the function returns a result.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes these two integers (t and n) to produce some output, though the exact nature of the output is not specified in the given information.
