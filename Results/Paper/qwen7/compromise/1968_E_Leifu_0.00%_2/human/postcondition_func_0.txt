The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each test case, it prints a sequence of pairs of integers. Specifically, it always prints '1 1' and '1 2'. Depending on the value of `n`, it may print additional pairs, including '2 3' if `n` is 3, and pairs 'j j' for `j` ranging from 4 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
