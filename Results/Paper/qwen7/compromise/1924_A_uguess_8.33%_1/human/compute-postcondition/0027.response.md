Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for ss in s:`. This means the loop variable `ss` is iterating over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string (without its first character).
   - `cur` is either the original value or 0.
   - `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of the new `s` minus the integer value of 'a'.
   - `cnt` is increased by 1 if `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\).

3. **Understand the loop body**: Although the loop body is omitted, we know it processes each character `ss` in the string `s`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, `ss` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - The string `s` will lose its first character (the one just processed) and become the remaining part of the string.
   - `cur` will be updated based on the current character `ss`.
   - `cur_ss` will be the integer value of the new first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'.
   - `cnt` will be incremented if `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `s` will now be the string `s` without its first character.
   - `cur` will be the value after processing the previous character.
   - `cur_ss` will be the integer value of the new first character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'.
   - `cnt` will be incremented by 1 if `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\).

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string (without its first character), `cur` is either the original value or 0, `cur_ss` is the integer value of the first character of the new `s` minus the integer value of 'a', and `cnt` is increased by 1 if `cur` equals \(2^k - 1\)**.
