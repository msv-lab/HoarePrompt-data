Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `ss` in the expression `for ss in s`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `i` is the length of the input string `s`.
   - `t` is decremented by 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `cnt` is 2.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the character `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
   - The condition `if cur & 1 << cur_ss` evaluates to 0, then `cur` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand what happens inside the loop**:
   - `ss` is the current character from the string `s`.
   - `cur_ss` is calculated as the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'.
   - The condition `if cur & 1 << cur_ss` checks if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` in `cur` is 0. If it is 0, `cur` remains unchanged; otherwise, it changes.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` remains the same because it is the length of the string `s` and does not change within the loop.
   - `t` is decremented by 1, so for the next iteration, `t` will be `t - 1`.
   - `n` remains the same because it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - `k` remains the same because it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - `m` remains the same because it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - `cnt` remains 2 because it is set to 2 at the beginning and does not change within the loop.
   - `cur` may or may not change based on the condition, but we cannot predict its exact value without knowing the specific character `ss`.
   - `cur_ss` is calculated based on the current character `ss` and does not change between iterations.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` (which is decremented by 1).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 2, `cur` is unknown, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the character `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'**.
