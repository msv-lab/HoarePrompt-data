Postcondition: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 3, `cur` is either `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` or remains unchanged, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the value of `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**.

This means that after the if-else block executes, the length of the input string `s` (`i`) and other input values remain as initially specified. Depending on whether the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` is true or false, the value of `cur` will either be updated to `cur + (1 << cur_ss)` or remain unchanged. The variables `ss` and `cur_ss` also retain their meanings as the next character in the string `s` and its corresponding numerical value, respectively.
