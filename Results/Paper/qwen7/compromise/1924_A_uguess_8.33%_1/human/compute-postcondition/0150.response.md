Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`.
- `n` is the input integer from the first input split.
- `k` is the input integer from the second input split.
- `m` is the input integer from the third input split.
- `cnt` is the total number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met.
- `cur` is 0.
- `ss` is the last character in the string `s` after the loop has executed.
- The current value of `ss` is the ASCII value of the last character in `s` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.
- The condition `cnt >= n` is true.

The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` without any variables or conditions affecting it, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
