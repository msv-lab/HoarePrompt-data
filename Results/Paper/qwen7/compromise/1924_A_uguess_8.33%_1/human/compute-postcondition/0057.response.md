Output State: **The loop will execute exactly `k` times, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k + 1`, `cur` will always be 0, `tmp` will hold the character 'a', and `ans` will contain the character 'a' added `k` times.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += tmp` adds the value of `tmp` (which is 'a') to `ans` for each iteration of the loop. Since `tmp` is 'a' and does not change, `ans` will accumulate 'a' a total of `k` times. The other variables (`i`, `cur`, and `tmp`) retain their final values from the loop execution as described in the initial state.
