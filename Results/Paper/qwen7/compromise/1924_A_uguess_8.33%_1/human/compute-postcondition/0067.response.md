Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0, `cur` is 0, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the ASCII value of the character `ss` and subtracts the ASCII value of `'a'` from it. However, the initial value or specific value of `ss` is not provided, so `cur_ss` is expressed as the general formula given in the code. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
