Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `k`**:
   - `i` is initially set to the length of the input string `s`.
   - `k` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < k`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be less than `k`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `t` is `t - 3` (this does not affect the loop).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `cnt` is less than `n`.
- `cur` is 0.
- `tmp` is an empty string.
- `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)` repeated `cnt` times.

We only need to adjust the states related to the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `i` must be less than `k`.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` must be less than `k`**
