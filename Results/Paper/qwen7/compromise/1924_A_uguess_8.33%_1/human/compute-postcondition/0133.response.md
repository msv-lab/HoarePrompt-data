Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 9` or `t - 15` depending on the value of `cnt` relative to `n`, `n` is the input integer from the first input split, `k` is the input integer from the second input split, `m` is the input integer from the third input split, `cnt` is 2, `cur` remains unchanged, `ss` is the next character in the string `s`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`, `(cur & 1 << cur_ss)` will evaluate to 0 if the bit corresponding to `cur_ss` is not set in `cur`.**

Explanation: The given code snippet updates the variable `cnt` by incrementing it by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 1. After executing `cnt += 1`, the new value of `cnt` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them in the provided code snippet.
