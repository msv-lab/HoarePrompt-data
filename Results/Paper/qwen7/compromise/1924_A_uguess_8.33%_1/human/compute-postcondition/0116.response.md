Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i = ord('a') + k - 1`: This means `i` is the ASCII value of 'a' plus `k` minus 1. Since the ASCII value of 'a' is 97, `i` would be `97 + k - 1 = 96 + k`.
   - `k` remains the same as the initial input.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `tmp` is an empty string.
   - `ans` is equal to `ans + 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`. However, since `ans` is not initialized in the given state, it must be an empty string initially. Also, `cnt` is not mentioned, so let's assume `cnt` is 0 for simplicity (since no other information is provided).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(ans)`.
   - Given the initial state, `ans` is an empty string because it hasn't been modified yet.

Therefore, the print statement will output an empty string.

Output: **''**
