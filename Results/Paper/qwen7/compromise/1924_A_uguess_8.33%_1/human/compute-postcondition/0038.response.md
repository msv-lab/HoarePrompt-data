Based on the initial state described:

- `cur` is either \((1 << k) - 1\) or 0.
- `cnt` is incremented by 1 each time `cur` equals \((1 << k) - 1\).
- `i` is equal to the length of the original string `s`.
- `t` remains at least 1.
- `n`, `k`, and `m` retain their initial values.
- The current value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
