Output State: **`i` is the length of the input string `s`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 2, `cur` is `cur + 1 << cur_ss`, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of the character `ss` minus the ASCII value of 'a'**.

This means that the value of `cur` has been updated by adding `1` shifted left by the value of `cur_ss`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
