Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes exactly `k` times, `i` will be equal to `k + 1`.
- `cur` will always be 0.
- `tmp` will hold the character 'a'.
- `ans` will contain the character 'a' added `n - cnt - 1` times.

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the `ans` variable since it's the only one mentioned in the `print` statement.

Given that `ans` contains the character 'a' added `n - cnt - 1` times, and considering the context, `cnt` must be 0 because `cur` is always 0 and there's no other information suggesting otherwise. Therefore, `ans` will contain the character 'a' added `n - 0 - 1 = n - 1` times.

So, the output will be a string consisting of the character 'a' repeated `n - 1` times.

Output: **'a' * (n - 1)**
