Output State: **`i` is `length(s) + 2`, `cur` is such that when shifted left by `(length(s) + 2)` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0, and `tmp` is the character 'b'**.

Explanation: 
- The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by the code. It is still `length(s) + 2`.
- The variable `cur` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by the code. It is defined such that when shifted left by `(length(s) + 2)` bits and bitwise ANDed with 1, the result is 0.
- The variable `tmp` is reassigned to the character corresponding to the integer `ord('a') + i`. Since `i` is `length(s) + 2`, `tmp` becomes the character corresponding to `ord('a') + (length(s) + 2)`, which is `'b'` (since `ord('a')` is 97 and adding 2 gives 99, which corresponds to 'b').
