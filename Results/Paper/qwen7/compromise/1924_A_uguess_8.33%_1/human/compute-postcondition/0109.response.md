Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < k`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 1` and is now equal to `ord('a') + i`.
   - `tmp` is a character where its ASCII value is `ord('a') + i`.
   - The condition `cur & 1 << i == 0` determines if `i` remains unchanged.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - If `cur & 1 << i == 0`, then `i` and `tmp` remain unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `i` would be incremented by 1 (which is already handled by the loop increment).

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, regardless of the condition, `i` will be `ord('a') + i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `ord('a') + i + 1`.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - `tmp` will be a character with an ASCII value of `ord('a') + i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `ord('a') + i + 1`, `k` is the same, `tmp` is a character where its ASCII value is `ord('a') + i + 1`**
