Postcondition: **All characters in the string `s` have been processed; `cur` is either \((1 << k) - 1\) or 0; `cnt` is incremented by 1 each time `cur` equals \((1 << k) - 1\); `i` is equal to the length of the original string `s`; `t` remains at least 1; `n`, `k`, and `m` retain their initial values; if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` remains equal to the length of the original string `s`. Otherwise, after all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k + 1`, `cur` will always be 0, `tmp` will hold the character 'a', and `ans` will contain the character 'a' added `n - cnt - 1` times.**
