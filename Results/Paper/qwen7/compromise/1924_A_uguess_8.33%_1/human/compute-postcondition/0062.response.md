Output State: **`i` remains the same (length of the original string `s`), `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`. It does not affect the values of `i` or `t`. The variable `t` is mentioned to decrease by 1 in the initial state description, which is not directly modified by the given code but is noted as being decremented.
