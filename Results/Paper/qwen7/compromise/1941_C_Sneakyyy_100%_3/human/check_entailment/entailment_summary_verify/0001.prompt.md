You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

    pppiepieeee

Output

    2
    0
    2
    6
    0
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it counts the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the string `s`. The function then prints the total count of these occurrences for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of deletions needed.
   - It also initializes an index `i` to 0, which will be used to traverse the string.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`. This ensures that we do not go out of bounds when checking substrings of length 3.
   - Inside the loop, it extracts a substring `s` of length 3 starting from index `i`.
   - If `s` is either "map" or "pie", it increments `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1, effectively skipping the next 3 characters.
   - If `s` is neither "map" nor "pie", it simply increments `i` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

### Testing with Examples:

Let's test the program with the provided examples to see if it behaves as expected.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `"mmapnapie"`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: Deleting the 4th and 9th characters results in "mmnapie", which is beautiful.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `"azabazapi"`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Explanation: The string is already beautiful.

#### Example 3:
- Input: `"mappppie"`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: Deleting the 4th and 9th characters results in "mpppie", which is beautiful.

#### Example 4:
- Input: `"mapmapmapmapmapmap"`
- Expected Output: `6`
- Explanation: Deleting every instance of "map" results in an empty string, which is beautiful.

#### Example 5:
- Input: `"p"`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Explanation: The string is already beautiful.

#### Example 6:
- Input: `"pppiepieeee"`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: Deleting the 4th and 9th characters results in "pppiepee", which is beautiful.

### Conclusion:

After testing the program with the provided examples, it appears that the program correctly identifies the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. The logic is sound and handles all the test cases appropriately.
