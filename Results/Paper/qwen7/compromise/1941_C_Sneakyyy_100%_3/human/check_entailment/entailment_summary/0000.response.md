Reasoning:
- The provided program aims to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful by removing all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".
- The program iterates through the string and checks every three consecutive characters.
- If "map" or "pie" is found, it increments the counter and skips ahead by three positions.
- If no such substrings are found, it simply moves to the next character.
- The logic correctly identifies and removes the minimum number of characters needed to eliminate all instances of "map" and "pie".

Given the execution summary, the program processes each test case correctly by counting the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and prints the result. Since the logic matches the problem requirements and the execution summary confirms the expected behavior, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
