Postcondition: **`i` is either 2, 4, or 6; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with its length greater than 5; `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` (starting from index 0 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1; `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3.**
