Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not affect its value. The new variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4 is still valid.
