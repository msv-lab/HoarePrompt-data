Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 3, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string with its length greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` (starting from index 0 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, and `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index 0 and having length 3.
