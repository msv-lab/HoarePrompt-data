Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 6; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a string with its length greater than 5; `ans` is 2 if the substring `s` (starting from index 0 and having length 3) is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1; `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having length 3.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially 1 if the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', or 0 otherwise, after executing this line, `ans` will be 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', and 1 if `s` is neither 'map' nor 'pie'. All other variables remain unchanged.
