Postcondition: **`i` is either 2, 4, or 6, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` is 2 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 1, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the index `i` and having a length of 3, unless the index `i + 2` is out of bounds, in which case `s` will be shorter or non-existent, and the number of iterations left is \(N - k\).**
