Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and s is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) - 2:
        s = a[i:i + 3]
        if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
            i += 3
            ans += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations will have the following characteristics:

- `i` will be equal to the length of the string `a` minus 2, because the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 2, and it increments `i` by 1 or 3 each time.
- `t` will remain a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` will remain an input integer, unchanged by the loop.
- `a` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `ans` will be the total count of occurrences where the substring `s` (of length 3) starting from index `i` is either 'map' or 'pie'. This count is incremented each time such a condition is met during the loop's iterations.
- `s` will be the substring of `a` starting from the last possible index (length of `a` minus 2) and having a length of 3, unless the last possible index does not form a complete substring of length 3, in which case `s` will be shorter or non-existent.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` remains unchanged, `ans` is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from the index `i` and having a length of 3 (unless the index `i + 2` is out of bounds, in which case `s` will be shorter or non-existent), and the number of iterations left is 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the string `a`, indicating that the loop has processed all possible substrings of length 3 in `a`. The variable `ans` will hold the total count of how many times the substrings 'map' or 'pie' appeared in `a`. The variable `s` will either be the last possible substring of length 3 in `a` or will be empty if there are no more substrings of length 3 left to process.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop continues to increment `i` and update `ans` based on the condition that the substring `s` of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 (unless the index 2 is out of bounds) is either 'map' or 'pie'. 

After all iterations of the loop, the final state will be:
- `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 2`, as the loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches this value.
- `ans` will be the total count of occurrences where the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie'.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `s` will be the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 (or shorter if the end of the string is reached).

In summary, `i` will be `len(a) - 2`, `ans` will hold the total count of 'map' or 'pie' substrings found in `a`, and the other variables (`n`, `a`, `t`, and `s`) will retain their initial or last updated values accordingly.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
