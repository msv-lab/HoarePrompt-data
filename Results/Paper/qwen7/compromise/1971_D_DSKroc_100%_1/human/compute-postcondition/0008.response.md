Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `count` is either 0 or 1, `s` is a non-empty string, `flag` is 1, `i` is 0.

Explanation: If the condition `int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1])` is true, then `count` is incremented to 1 and `flag` is set to 1. If the condition is false, `count` remains 0 and `flag` is still set to 1. Therefore, the final value of `count` will be either 0 or 1, depending on whether the characters at positions `i` and `i+1` in the string `s` are different.
