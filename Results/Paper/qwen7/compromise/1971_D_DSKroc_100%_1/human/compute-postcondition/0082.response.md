Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `q` is 2, `count` is 0, `s` is an input string, `flag` is 0, `i` is equal to `len(s) - 2` after the input is taken, the length of `s` is at least 2, and the current value of `s[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s[i + 1]`.
