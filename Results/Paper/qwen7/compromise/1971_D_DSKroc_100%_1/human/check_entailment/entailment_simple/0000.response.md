Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
2. The provided solution iterates through the string and counts the number of transitions from '0' to '1'. If there are no such transitions, it means the string is already sorted, and we need to count the number of segments plus one (since an entire string is considered one segment).
3. If there is at least one transition, the number of pieces required is simply the number of transitions counted.
4. The logic in the code correctly implements this approach:
   - `flag` is used to check if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'.
   - `count` keeps track of the number of transitions.
   - Based on the value of `flag`, the appropriate number of pieces is printed (`count + 1` if `flag` is 0, otherwise `count`).

Given the explanation and the logic implemented in the code, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
