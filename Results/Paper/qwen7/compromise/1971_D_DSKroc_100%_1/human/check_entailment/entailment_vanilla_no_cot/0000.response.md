Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Counting of Cuts**: The logic for counting cuts is flawed. The current implementation counts every transition between different characters (0 to 1 or 1 to 0), which is not always the optimal way to split the string. For example, in the string "1001", the current code would count two transitions (between '1' and '0', and between '0' and '1'), but the optimal split would be just one piece: "10" and "01".

2. **Handling Sorted Strings**: The flag variable is used to check if the string is already sorted. However, this approach is incomplete. If the string is sorted, it should be considered as needing zero cuts, but the current logic might still count cuts incorrectly.

3. **Optimal Splitting Strategy**: The optimal strategy is to split the string at the last occurrence of '0' (if any) and then at the first occurrence of '1' (if any). This ensures that the left part contains all '0's and the right part contains all '1's.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        # Find the last position of '0' and the first position of '1'
        last_zero = s.rfind('0')
        first_one = s.find('1')
        
        # If there are no '0's or no '1's, the string is already sorted
        if last_zero == -1 or first_one == -1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # Calculate the number of pieces needed
            pieces_needed = 1 + (first_one > last_zero)
            print(pieces_needed)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution correctly identifies the minimum number of pieces needed to split the string into sorted parts.
