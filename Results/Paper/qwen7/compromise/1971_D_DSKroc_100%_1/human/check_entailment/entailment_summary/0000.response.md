Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify whether it correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Let's break down the logic and compare it with the requirements:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The goal is to find the minimum number of pieces to cut the binary string into so that the pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. A sorted binary string means all '0's come before all '1's.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the string to count the number of changes in consecutive characters.
   - If there are no instances where a character is less than its next character (`int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`), it implies the string is already sorted. In this case, the minimum number of pieces required is 1.
   - Otherwise, the program prints the count of changes in consecutive characters.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The logic of counting changes in consecutive characters is correct. This count gives us the number of boundaries where the string transitions from '0' to '1'.
   - However, the logic for determining the minimum number of pieces is flawed. The program should consider the following:
     - If the string is already sorted, it needs 1 piece.
     - If the string is not sorted, the number of pieces required is one more than the number of transitions because each transition indicates a change in the order of '0's and '1's, requiring an additional piece to separate these segments.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - If the string is sorted, the answer is 1.
   - If the string is not sorted, the answer is the count of transitions plus 1.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution. It simply prints the count of transitions without adding 1 when the string is not sorted.

Correctness: **False**
