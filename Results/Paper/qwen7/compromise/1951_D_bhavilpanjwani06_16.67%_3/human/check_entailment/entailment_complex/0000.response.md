Reasoning:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The program only calls `func_1()` without handling multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement. The problem requires processing multiple test cases, but the code only processes one test case and then exits.

2. **Logic for Determining 'YES' or 'NO'**: The logic inside `func_1()` does not fully address the problem requirements. Specifically:
   - If `n < k`, it correctly prints 'NO'.
   - If `n == k`, it prints 'YES', 1, and `n`. This is correct.
   - If `n > k` and `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it prints 'YES', 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1. This is also correct.
   - However, if `n > k` and `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`, it incorrectly prints 'NO'. According to the problem, in this case, Bob should still be able to set up stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Stall Setup Logic**: The program does not provide the necessary logic to set up the stalls and prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels when `n > k` and `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`.

Given these issues, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
