### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Basic Cases**:
   - If `n < k`, Alice cannot buy `k` jewels because she doesn't have enough coins. Therefore, the output should be "NO". This part is correct.
   - If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by spending all her coins at one stall. Therefore, the output should be "YES" with 1 stall and the price equal to `n`. This part is also correct.
3. **Intermediate Case**:
   - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it means Alice can buy `k-1` jewels at the first stall and then use the remaining coins to buy 1 jewel at another stall. This ensures she buys exactly `k` jewels. Therefore, the output should be "YES" with 2 stalls, where the first stall has a price of `n - k + 1` and the second stall has a price of 1. This part is correct.

However, the original assessment misses a critical point in the general case:

4. **General Case**:
   - The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is not always sufficient to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Specifically, if `n - k + 1` is too large, Alice might still be able to buy more than `k` jewels even after the first stall. For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the condition `3 < 6` is satisfied, but setting the first stall price to `6` would allow Alice to buy 6 jewels, which is more than `k`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the remaining coins after the first stall are not enough to buy additional jewels. The correct approach would be to check if the remaining coins after buying `k-1` jewels from the first stall are less than the price of the next stall.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    elif n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(n)
    elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(n - k + 1, 1)
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        print([1] * k)
```

In this corrected version:
- If `n - k + 1` is too large, we set up `k` stalls, each priced at 1 coin. This ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Correctness:
The original assessment missed the critical point in the general case, leading to an incorrect solution. The corrected version ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels in all cases.

**Final: False**
