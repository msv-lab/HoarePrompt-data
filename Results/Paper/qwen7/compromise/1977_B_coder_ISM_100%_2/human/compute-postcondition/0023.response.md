Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 29, `s` is a list of length 59 (since the loop runs 30 times and starts with a length of 30, making the final length 30 + 29 = 59), and each element in `s` is either '1' or '0' based on whether `x & pow(2, i)` is true or false for each iteration from 0 to 29.
