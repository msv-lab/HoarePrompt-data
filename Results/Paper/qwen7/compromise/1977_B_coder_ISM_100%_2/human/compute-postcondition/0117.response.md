Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `nalla`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nalla` is 30.
   - `t` must be greater than 30 (though this variable is not directly involved in the loop).
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list with length 30.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 29` (inclusive), as specified by `range(30)`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was 29 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 30 at the start of the next iteration.
   - However, since the loop range is `range(30)`, the loop will stop when `i` reaches 30, meaning the loop will not execute again.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 30 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `nalla` remains 30.
   - `t` must still be greater than 30.
   - `x` remains an input integer.
   - `s` remains a list with length 30.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`nalla` is 30, `t` must be greater than 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with length 30**.
