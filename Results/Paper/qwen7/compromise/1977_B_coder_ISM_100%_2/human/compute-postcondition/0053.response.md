Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is either 0 or 1, the character at index 0 of string `s` is '-', and if `flag` is 1, the character at index 1 of string `s` is not '0'. If `flag` is 0, the character at index 1 of string `s` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the character at index `i` of string `s` to `'-'`. Since `i` is 1, the character at index 1 of string `s` is now `'-'`. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged, and the condition regarding the character at index 1 of string `s` based on the value of `flag` also remains valid.
