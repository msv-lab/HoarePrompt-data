Output State: **`i` is 2; `length` is 30; `s[2]` is '0'**

The code `s[i] = '0'` assigns the value `'0'` to the index `i` in the list `s`. Given that `i` is 2, the element at index 2 of the list `s` is now `'0'`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and the value of `length` also remains unchanged at 30.
