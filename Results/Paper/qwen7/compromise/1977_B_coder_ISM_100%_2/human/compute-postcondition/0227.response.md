Output State: After the loop executes all 30 iterations, `i` will be 29, `length` is 30, and the list `s` will contain 30 elements. Each element in `s` will be '1' if the corresponding bit (from 0 to 29) of `x` is set to 1, and '0' otherwise.

In other words, `s` will represent the binary representation of the integer `x`, with the most significant bit (MSB) at index 29 and the least significant bit (LSB) at index 0.
