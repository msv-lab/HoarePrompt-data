Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < length`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `length`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 2.
   - `length` is at least 29.
   - The postcondition specifies that if `s[1]` is '-1' and `s[0]` is '1', then the program continues without any change to the variables.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, `i` will become 3 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which will be 3) must still be less than `length`.
   - Given that `length` is at least 29, it will still satisfy the condition `i < length` even after `i` becomes 3.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `length` remains at least 29.
   - The postcondition related to `s[0]` and `s[1]` does not affect the loop continuation condition and remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `length` is at least 29**.
