Output State: **`i` is 2, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[2]` is '0', and `s[3]` is '0' if `flag` is 0, and equal to `s[2]` which is '0' otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '0'` changes the value of `s[2]` to '0' since `i` is 2. The value of `flag` remains either 0 or 1, and based on the value of `flag`, `s[3]` is updated to '0' if `flag` is 0, or remains equal to `s[2]` which is now '0'.
