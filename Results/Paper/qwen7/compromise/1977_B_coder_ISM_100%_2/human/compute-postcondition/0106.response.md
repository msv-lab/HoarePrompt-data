Output State: **`nalla` is 30, `t` must be greater than 30, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The values of `nalla` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet. The condition for `t` to be greater than 30 still holds true.
