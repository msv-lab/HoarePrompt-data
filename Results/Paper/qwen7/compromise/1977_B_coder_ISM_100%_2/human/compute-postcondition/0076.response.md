Output State: **`i` is 28; `flag` is either 0 or 1; the character at index 0 of string `s` is '1'; the characters at indices 1 through 28 of string `s` are either '0' or '-1' depending on the value of `flag`; the character at index 29 of string `s` is '1'.**

The code `s[29] = '1'` changes the character at index 29 of string `s` from '0' to '1'. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
