Output State: **After all iterations, `i` is 28, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[28]` is '0', and `s[29]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 28` (inclusive), meaning it executes 29 times. After each iteration, `i` increments by 1. Therefore, after the last iteration, `i` will be 28. The value of `flag` remains either 0 or 1 as no condition changes its value beyond these two states. The loop sets `s[i]` to '0' when `flag` is 1, which happens when `s[i]` and `s[i+1]` are both '1'. Since the loop processes each index from 0 to 27, by the end, `s[28]` and `s[29]` are both set to '0'.
