Output State: **`flag` is 1, the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is '1', and the character at index `i` of string `s` is '-1', and either the character at index `i + 2` is not '1' or `s[i + 2]` does not exist.**

Explanation: The variable `flag` is assigned the value 1, while the characters at indices `i`, `i + 1`, and `i + 2` of string `s` remain unchanged. The condition about the character at index `i + 2` not being '1' or not existing also remains valid.
