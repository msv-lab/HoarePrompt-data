Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `length` is at least 29.
   - If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` remains '-1'. Otherwise, `s[i]` is '0'.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `length`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `length` must remain at least 29 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `length` must still be at least 29.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `length` is at least 29**
