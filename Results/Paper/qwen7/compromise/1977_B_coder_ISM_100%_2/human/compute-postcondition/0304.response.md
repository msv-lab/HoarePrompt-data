Based on the initial state provided:

- `flag` is 0
- `i` is 30
- `length` is 31
- The string `s` has been processed such that every instance of '-1' followed by '1' has been removed, and no further changes can be made.

The `print(length)` statement will print the value of the variable `length`.

Output: **31**
