Output State: **`i` is 2, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[2]` is '1', `s[3]` is equal to `s[2]`**.

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '1'` changes the value of `s[2]` to '1' since `i` is 2. The value of `flag` remains unchanged, and the condition for setting `s[3]` is no longer applicable because `s[3]` is now explicitly set to be equal to `s[2]`, which is '1'.
