Output State: **`i` is 28, `flag` is 1, the character at index 0 of string `s` is '1', and the characters at indices 1 through 28 of string `s` are '-1', and the character at index 29 of string `s` is '0', and the length of string `s` is 30; length is 31**.

The code `length += 1` increments the value of `length` by 1. Since the initial value of `length` was not specified, we assume it was 30 (as given by the length of string `s`). After executing the code, `length` becomes 31. All other variables remain unchanged.
