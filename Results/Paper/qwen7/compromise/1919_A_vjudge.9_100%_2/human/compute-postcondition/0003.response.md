Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each containing either "Bob" or "Alice", depending on the input values for `a` and `b` in each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each iteration `i` from `0` to `t-1`, if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the line will contain "Bob"; otherwise, it will contain "Alice". The values of `a` and `b` for each iteration are provided as input to the loop.
