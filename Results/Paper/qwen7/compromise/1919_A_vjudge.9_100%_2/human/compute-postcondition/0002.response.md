Output State: The output state will consist of 'Bob' or 'Alice' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the condition `if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' will be printed; otherwise, 'Alice' will be printed. The exact sequence of 'Bob' and 'Alice' depends on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.
