Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules. According to the problem description, the game continues until a player cannot make a valid move. The program incorrectly determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`, which does not account for the sequence of moves and the ability to swap wallets.

For example, consider the test case `(a=1, b=4)`:
- Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with 4 coins.
- Alice can choose to swap wallets or not. If she swaps, she gets 4 coins, and Bob gets 1 coin.
- Bob then has the option to swap back or not. If he swaps back, the game state reverts to the original, and Alice can again choose to swap or not.

This example shows that the program does not handle the game logic correctly, as it fails to account for the sequence of moves and the ability to swap wallets dynamically. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
