### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code against the problem description and the example given.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob take turns playing, starting with Alice.
- Each player can either swap wallets or keep them.
- After each turn, a player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
- It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even.
- If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
- Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

#### Example Analysis:
Let's use the example provided to understand why the program is incorrect.

1. **Test Case (1, 1):**
   - Alice has 1 coin, Bob has 1 coin.
   - Alice can choose not to swap, leaving her with 0 coins.
   - Bob must then choose not to swap, leaving him with 0 coins.
   - Alice loses because she cannot make a move.

2. **Test Case (1, 4):**
   - Alice has 1 coin, Bob has 4 coins.
   - Alice can swap wallets, getting 4 coins, and Bob gets 1 coin.
   - Bob can now choose not to swap, leaving Alice with 4 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
