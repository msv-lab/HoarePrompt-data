### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing one coin from their current wallet. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the game essentially boils down to the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because:
   - If the difference is even, the player whose turn it is can always force the difference to become odd by swapping wallets and removing a coin.
   - If the difference is odd, the player whose turn it is will eventually be left with an even difference, allowing the opponent to force the difference back to odd.

3. **Implementation Check**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.
   - If the absolute difference is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - Based on the parity of the difference, the program correctly determines the winner according to the game rules.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
