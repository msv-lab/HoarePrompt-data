Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively.
3. **Determining the Winner**:
   - The program checks whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the absolute difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the absolute difference is odd, it prints "Alice".
4. **Game Logic**:
   - The key observation here is that the game essentially boils down to the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have.
   - If the difference is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he wins.
   - If the difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that changes the difference to even, ensuring she wins.

Given these points, the program accurately reflects the optimal strategy for both players and correctly outputs the winner for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
