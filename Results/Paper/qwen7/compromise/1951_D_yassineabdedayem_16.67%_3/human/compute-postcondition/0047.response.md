Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is 60.
- `number` is non-zero.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times.

The print statement is `print(i, end=' ')`.

However, there is no variable `i` defined in the initial state. Since `i` is not explicitly defined and no operation is performed that would assign a value to `i`, `i` remains undefined.

Given this, the print statement will attempt to print an undefined variable `i` followed by a space (`end=' '`).

Output: **i **
