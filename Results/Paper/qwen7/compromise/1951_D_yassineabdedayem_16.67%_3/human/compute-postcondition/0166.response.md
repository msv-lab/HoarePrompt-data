Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `tab`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `tab`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is the second-to-last element in the list `tab`
   - `n` is 0
   - `k` is 0
   - `rep` is 60
   - `Min` is 0
   - `Max` is 0
   - `number` is 0
   - `tab` is a list that must have at least two elements

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second-to-last element in `tab`, the next value of `i` will be the last element in `tab`.
   - For the loop to continue, `tab` must still have at least one element (since it had at least two elements initially and we just used the second-to-last element).

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will now be the last element in `tab`.
   - `tab` must still have at least one element.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is a list that must have at least one element**
