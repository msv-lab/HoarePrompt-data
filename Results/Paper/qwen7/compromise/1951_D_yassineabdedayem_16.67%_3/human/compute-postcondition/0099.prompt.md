Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rep` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the input, `k` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the input, `t` is an integer between 0 and 999 inclusive, `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))` is calculated using the new value of `n` and `k`, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the final iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the final iteration, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k` for the final iteration.
Code of the loop:
while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
    Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)
    if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
        number = Min
        k = k - Max
    else:
        number = Max
        k = k - Min
    tab.append(str(number))
    n -= Min * Max
    rep += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rep` is 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is adjusted based on the if-else condition, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is either `Min` or `Max` depending on the condition evaluated in the if-else block, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `rep` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min`, `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the new value of `k`, and `number` is added to the list `tab` as a string.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `rep` is `rep + 1`, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is updated to either `k - 2*Max` or `k - Min`, `Min` is updated to `min(n // (k - Max), k - Max)` or `min(n // (k + Min), k + Min)`, `Max` is updated to `max(int(n / (k - Max)), k - Max)` or `max(int(n / (k + Min)), k + Min)`, `number` is updated to either `Min` or `Max`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `n` is further updated to `n - Min * Max


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
