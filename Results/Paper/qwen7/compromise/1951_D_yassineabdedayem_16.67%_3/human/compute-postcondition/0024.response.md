Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**.

Explanation: The line `number = Max` simply reassigns the variable `number` to the current value of `Max`. Since `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` now holds this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
