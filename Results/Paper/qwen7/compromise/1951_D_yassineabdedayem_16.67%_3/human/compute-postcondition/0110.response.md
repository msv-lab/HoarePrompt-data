Output State: `rep` is 0, `k` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `tab` must have at least as many elements as there are iterations of the loop.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will hold the value of the last element in the list `tab`. The variables `rep` and `k` remain unchanged at 0 since they are not modified within the loop. The list `tab` must contain at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop (which is the length of the list).
