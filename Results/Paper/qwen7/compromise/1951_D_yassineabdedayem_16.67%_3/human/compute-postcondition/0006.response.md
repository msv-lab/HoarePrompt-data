Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k)`.

2. **Analyze each part of the loop condition**:
   - `n != 0`: This ensures that `n` is not zero.
   - `k > 0`: This ensures that `k` is positive.
   - `rep < 60`: This ensures that `rep` is less than 60.
   - `n >= k`: This ensures that `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `n` is an integer read from input.
   - `k` is an integer read from input.
   - `rep` is 0.
   - `number` is 0.
   - `tab` is an empty list.

4. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - Since `rep` is currently 0, it automatically satisfies `rep < 60`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is not zero, `k` is positive, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `n` must be non-zero.
   - `k` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Given these conditions, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n` must be non-zero; `k` must be greater than 0; `rep` is 0; `number` is 0; `tab` is an empty list.**
