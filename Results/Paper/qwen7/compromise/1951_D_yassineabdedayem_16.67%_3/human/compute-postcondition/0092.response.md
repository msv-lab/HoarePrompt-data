Output State: **`rep` is less than 60, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Max`**

Explanation: The line `number = Max` assigns the value of `Max` to the variable `number`. The values of `rep`, `n`, `k`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged from their previous states.
