Output State: **`rep` is 2, `k` is `k - Max`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`**

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Max` from its current value. Here, `Max` is not explicitly defined, but it is implied to be the maximum of `n // k` and `k`. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `Min` and `number` remain unchanged as they are both equal to `min(n // k, k)`. The precondition that `k` must be greater than 0 still holds, but since `k` is updated, we express it as `k` is `k - Max`.
