Output State: `total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)` (though these will be 0 since `n` and `k` are 0), and `tab` is a list containing up to 60 elements, each being the string representation of `number` determined in each iteration.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`. Given that the output state after 3 iterations shows `n` and `k` being adjusted accordingly, and considering the loop's termination conditions, the loop will continue until `n` becomes 0 or `rep` reaches 60. Since `n` is reduced by `Min * Max` in each iteration and `k` is reduced by either `Max` or `Min`, eventually `n` will reach 0, causing the loop to terminate. At this point, `rep` will be 60 because the loop runs up to 60 iterations, and `k` will also be 0. The variable `number` will be 0 in the final iteration since both `n` and `k` are 0. Therefore, `Min` and `Max` will also be 0.
