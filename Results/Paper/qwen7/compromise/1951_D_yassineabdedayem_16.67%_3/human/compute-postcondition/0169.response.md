Output State: `total` is 0, `i` is the first element in the list `tab`, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, and `tab` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the list `tab`. After all iterations, `i` will be the first element in the list (since the loop processes each element from the last to the first), and the list `tab` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The other variables (`total`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop body.
