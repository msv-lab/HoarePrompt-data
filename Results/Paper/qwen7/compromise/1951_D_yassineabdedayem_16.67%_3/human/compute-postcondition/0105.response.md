Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `tab`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `tab`.
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `tab`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `rep` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `i` is the first element in the list `tab`.
   - `tab` must have at least one element.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the first element in `tab`, the next element in `tab` will be the second element.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must still have at least one element remaining. However, since `i` is now the first element, `tab` must have at least two elements to ensure there is another element to iterate over.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `rep` remains 0 because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `k` remains 0 because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` becomes the second element in `tab`.
   - `tab` must have at least two elements to ensure the loop can execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`rep` is 0, `k` is 0, `i` is the second element in the list `tab`, `tab` must have at least two elements**
