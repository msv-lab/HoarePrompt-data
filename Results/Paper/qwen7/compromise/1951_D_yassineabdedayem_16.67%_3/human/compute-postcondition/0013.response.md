Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `Max` (which is `max(int(n / k), k)`) to the variable `number`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
