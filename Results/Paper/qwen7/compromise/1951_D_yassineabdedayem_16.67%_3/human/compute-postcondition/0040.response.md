Output State: **`rep` is 3, `k` is either `k - Max` (if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`) or `k - min(n // k, k)`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` (if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`) or `max(int(n / k), k)` (otherwise), `tab` is a list with one additional element which is the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The value of `rep` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `k`, `n`, `Min`, `number`, and `tab` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them within the given code snippet.
