Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Min` (where `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`) or decreased by `Min`, `rep` is 1, `number` is either `Min` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The line `rep += 1` increments the value of `rep` by 1. Initially, `rep` is 0, so after executing this line, `rep` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
