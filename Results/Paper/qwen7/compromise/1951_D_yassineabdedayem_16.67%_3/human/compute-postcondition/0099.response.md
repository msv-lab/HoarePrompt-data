Output State: **rep** is 60, **n** is 0, **k** is 0, **Min** is 0, **Max** is 0, **number** is 0, **tab** is a list containing the string representations of numbers from each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all 60 iterations (since `rep < 60` and the loop increments `rep` by 1 each time it runs), both `n` and `k` will be reduced to 0 because `n` is subtracted by `Min * Max` in each iteration and `k` is adjusted accordingly within the loop's conditions. The variable `Min` and `Max` will also be 0 since they are recalculated based on the new values of `n` and `k` which eventually become 0. The variable `number` will be 0 as well since the loop's logic will no longer satisfy its conditions to change its value. Finally, `tab` will contain the string representations of the `number` values determined in each iteration of the loop, which will be appended to the list in each iteration until `n` becomes 0.
