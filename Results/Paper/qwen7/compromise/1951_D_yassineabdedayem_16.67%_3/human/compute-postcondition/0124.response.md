Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and the current value of `Max` is `k` and the current value of `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code `number = Min` assigns the value of `Min` to `number`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, `number` now holds this value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
