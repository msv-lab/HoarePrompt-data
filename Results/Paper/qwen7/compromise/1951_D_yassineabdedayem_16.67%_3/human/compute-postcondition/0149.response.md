Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - Max`, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Max` from it. The value of `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - max(int(n / k), k)`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
