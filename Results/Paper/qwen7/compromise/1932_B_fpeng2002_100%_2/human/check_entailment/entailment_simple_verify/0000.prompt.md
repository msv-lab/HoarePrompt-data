You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        print(start_year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: Output State: `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `start_year` is the result of applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x-1] + 1) * nums[x-1]` for each `x` from 0 to the length of `nums` minus one, iteratively.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_tests` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and `x` will be equal to the length of `nums`. The variable `start_year` will be the final value obtained by successively applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x-1] + 1) * nums[x-1]` to each element in the `nums` list, starting from an initial `start_year` of 0 and iterating over all elements in the list.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Specifically, the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities directly, rather than finding the cumulative effect of each sign occurring one after another.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  2 3 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The first sign occurs in year 2.
  - The second sign occurs in year 5 (2 + 3).
  - The third sign occurs in year 11 (5 + 6).

- Actual Output:
  - The program incorrectly calculates the LCM of 2, 3, and 6, which is 6. Thus, it outputs 6 instead of 11.

This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the sequential nature of the signs occurring. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
