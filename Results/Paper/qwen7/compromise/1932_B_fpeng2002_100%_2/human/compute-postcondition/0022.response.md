Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is 0, `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `start_year` based on the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Since `x` is 0, `nums[x]` refers to the first element of the list `nums`. However, the initial value of `start_year` is not specified, so we keep it as `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
