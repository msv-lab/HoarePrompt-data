Output State: `x` is equal to the length of `nums`; `start_year` is the result of applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` from 0 to the length of `nums` minus one, iteratively.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list, and `start_year` will be the final value obtained by repeatedly updating it according to the given formula for each element in the `nums` list.
