Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is `nums[x]`, `x` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates `start_year` to `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given the initial state, `start_year` is 0 and `x` is 0. Therefore, `start_year` becomes `(0 // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`. Since `nums[0]` is an integer from the list `nums`, and assuming `nums[0]` is not zero (as division by zero would raise an error), the expression simplifies to `nums[0]` because `0 // nums[0]` is 0, and `0 + 1` is 1, so `1 * nums[0]` is `nums[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
