Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is 2, `start_year` is updated to `(start_year // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `start_year` to `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given that `x` is 2, the code becomes `start_year = (start_year // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`. The other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, and `nums`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value for `start_year` based on its previous value and the value of `nums[2]`.
