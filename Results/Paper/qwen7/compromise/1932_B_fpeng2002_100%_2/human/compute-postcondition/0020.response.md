Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`. The variables involved here are `x`, `len(nums)`, and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` is the loop variable, and it starts at 0.
   - `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `len(nums)` is at least 1 (since `x` starts at 0).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `num_tests` and `start_year` are not directly related to the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.
   - `n` is not used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted.
   - `x` starts at 0, so no adjustment is needed for `x`.
   - `len(nums)` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, and `nums` must be a non-empty list.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `nums` must be a non-empty list.
- `len(nums)` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `len(nums)` must be at least 1, `start_year` is 0**
