Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in range(0, len(nums))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element.
   - `start_year` is `nums[x]`.
   - `x` is 0.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `x` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `x` must be less than `len(nums)`. Given that `x` is currently 0, the condition `x < len(nums)` is already satisfied, and the list `nums` has at least 1 element, so `len(nums)` is at least 1.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `num_tests` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `nums` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `start_year` will now be `nums[1]` because `x` will be incremented to 1.
   - `x` will be updated to 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is `nums[1]`, `x` is 1**
