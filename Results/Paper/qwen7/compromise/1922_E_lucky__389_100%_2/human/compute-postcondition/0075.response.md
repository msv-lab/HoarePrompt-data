Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state defines that `i` is 5.
2. `ansv` is a list containing the elements `[3, 4, 5, 5, 6]`.
3. The `print` statement accesses the element at index `i` in the list `ansv` and prints it with a space as the end character.

Given that `i` is 5, we need to access the element at index 5 in the list `ansv`. In Python, list indices start from 0, so the element at index 5 would actually be out of bounds since the list only has 5 elements (indices 0 through 4).

However, if we assume the list is zero-indexed and we still try to access it, the element at index 5 would be `None` because the list does not have an element at that position.

Therefore, the output will be `None`.

Output: **None**
