Postcondition: **`mx` is 4, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is 4, `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3], `i` is 5.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. Since the condition `i == 0` is false, the else part is executed, setting `mx` to 4, `x` to 4, `subseq_lens` to a list containing [3], and `i` to 5.
