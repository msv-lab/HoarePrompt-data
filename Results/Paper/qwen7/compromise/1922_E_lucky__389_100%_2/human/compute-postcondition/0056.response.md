Output State: **`mx` is either 4 or 6, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` must be 4, `subseq_lens` is a list containing [3, 4, i - 1], `i` is at least 5**

Explanation: The code appends `i - 1` to the list `subseq_lens`. Given that `i` is at least 5, `i - 1` will be at least 4. Since `subseq_lens` initially contains `[3]` or `[3, 4]`, after appending `i - 1`, it will become `[3, 4, i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
