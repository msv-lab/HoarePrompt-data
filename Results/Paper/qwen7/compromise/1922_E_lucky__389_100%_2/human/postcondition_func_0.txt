The function processes an input integer \( x \) and calculates a sequence of subsequence lengths based on powers of 2. It then constructs a list `ansv` containing these lengths and prints the length of this list followed by its elements. The function does not return any value and is designed to handle inputs \( x \) within the range 2 to \( 10^{18} \).
