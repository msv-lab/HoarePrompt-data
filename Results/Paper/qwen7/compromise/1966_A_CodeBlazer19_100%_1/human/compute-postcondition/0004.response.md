Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a test case defined by an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500). For each test case, it takes two integers n and k (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100) and a list of n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100 for each i). The function returns a result based on the given test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer t, followed by processing specific values n, k, and a list of integers c. The exact nature of the return value is not specified in the problem statement, so the focus is on the structure and input requirements of the function.
