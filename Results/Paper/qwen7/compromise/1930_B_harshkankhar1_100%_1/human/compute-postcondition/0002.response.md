Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers from 1 to \(n\) inclusive.
   - The elements at even indices of `a` are reversed.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*a)
   ```

Given these conditions, let's consider the list `a` more closely:
- Since `a` contains integers from 1 to \(n\) inclusive, it looks like this: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., n-1, n]`.
- The elements at even indices are reversed. This means that the elements at positions 2, 4, 6, ..., \(2k\) (where \(k\) is the largest integer such that \(2k \leq n\)) are swapped with their corresponding elements from the end of the list.

For example, if \(n = 6\), the list `a` would initially be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`. After reversing the even indices, it becomes `[1, 6, 3, 4, 5, 2]`.

Now, let's generalize this:
- The list `a` will have the form `[1, n, 3, n-1, 5, n-3, ..., (n-1) if n is odd, 2 if n is even]`.

When we print `*a`, it will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be the list `a` with the even-indexed elements reversed.

Output: **1 [n] 3 [n-1] 5 [n-3] ... [(n-1) if n is odd, 2 if n is even]**
