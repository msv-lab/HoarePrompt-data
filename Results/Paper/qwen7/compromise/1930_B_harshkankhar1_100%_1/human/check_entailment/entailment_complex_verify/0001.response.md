### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - Inside the loop for each test case, the function `func_1()` is called.
   - `func_1()` generates a list `a` containing integers from `1` to `n`.
   - It then reverses every other element in the list. Specifically, `a[::2]` selects every second element starting from index `0`, and `[::-1]` reverses these selected elements.

3. **Output**:
   - The reversed list `a` is printed using `print(*a)`.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- **Permutation Validity**:
  - The generated list `a` is indeed a permutation of integers from `1` to `n` because it contains each integer exactly once.
  - The key point is to verify if the generated permutation satisfies the condition that there do not exist two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

### Detailed Analysis

Let's consider the generated list `a` after reversing every other element:
- If `n` is even, the list will look like: `[n, 2, n-1, 4, ..., 3, 1]`.
- If `n` is odd, the list will look like: `[n, 2, n-1, 4, ..., 3, 1, n-2]`.

#### Case 1: \(n\) is Even
- Example: \(n = 4\)
  - Original list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Reversed every other element: `[4, 2, 3, 1]`
  - Check pairs:
    - \( (4, 2) \): 4 does not divide 2.
    - \( (2, 3) \): 2 does not divide 3.
    - \( (3, 1) \): 3 does not divide 1.
    - \( (1, 4) \): 1 does not divide 4.
  - All pairs satisfy the condition.

#### Case 2: \(n\) is Odd
- Example: \(n = 5\)
  - Original list: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Reversed every other element: `[5, 2, 4, 3, 1]`
  - Check pairs:
    - \( (5, 2) \): 5 does not divide 2.
    - \( (2, 4) \): 2 does not divide 4.
    - \( (4, 3) \): 4 does not divide 3.
    - \( (3, 1) \): 3 does not divide 1.
    - \( (1, 5) \): 1 does not divide 5.
  - All pairs satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion

The program correctly generates a valid permutation for each test case according to the problem description. The permutation ensures that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) exist such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).
