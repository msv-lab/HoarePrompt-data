Functionality: **The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as input, where both strings consist of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length. It modifies these strings such that for the first half of the string, each character in `x` becomes the maximum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`, and each character in `y` becomes the minimum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`. For the second half of the string, this process is reversed: each character in `x` becomes the minimum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`, and each character in `y` becomes the maximum of the corresponding characters in the original `x` and `y`. After modifying the strings, the function prints the modified `x` and `y` strings. The function does not return any value.**
