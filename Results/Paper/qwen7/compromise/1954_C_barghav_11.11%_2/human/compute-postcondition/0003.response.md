Output State: `x` and `y` are strings where for each character position `i` (0 â‰¤ `i` < length of `x`), if `i` is less than or equal to half the length of `x` - 1, then the `i`-th character of `x` is the maximum of the original `i`-th characters of `x` and `y`, and the `i`-th character of `y` is the minimum of the original `i`-th characters of `x` and `y`. If `i` is greater than half the length of `x` - 1, then the `i`-th character of `x` is the minimum of the original `i`-th characters of `x` and `y`, and the `i`-th character of `y` is the maximum of the original `i`-th characters of `x` and `y`.
