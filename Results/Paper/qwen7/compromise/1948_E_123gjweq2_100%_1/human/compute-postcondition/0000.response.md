Output State: **`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left < right`, and `small_element` is `left + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `left + 1` to the variable `small_element`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `left` and `right` are still integers such that `left < right`, and `small_element` is updated to be `left + 1`.
