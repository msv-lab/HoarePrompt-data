Output State: **`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left < right`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`**.

This means that `mid` is calculated as `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `(right - left + 1) // 2`. The values of `left`, `right`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged from their initial states.
