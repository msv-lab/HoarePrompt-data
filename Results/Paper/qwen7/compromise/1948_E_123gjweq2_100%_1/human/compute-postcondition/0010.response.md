The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. Both `left` and `right` are integers such that `left < right` and they are within the range [0, n-1], where n is the length of the array `arr`. The parameter `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier. The function does not explicitly return any value based on the given information, but rather seems to modify or create an array based on the provided indices and clique identifier.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`, where `left` and `right` are integers within a specific range and `clique` is an integer. It modifies or creates an array based on these parameters.**
