### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the example test cases.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculates the minimum number of cliques needed.
   - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These initialize the arrays to store the assigned values and clique identifiers.

2. **Loop through `cliques`:**
   - For each `i` from `0` to `cliques - 1`, the function `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)` is called.
   - `make_array` fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` based on the specified range and clique index.

#### Function `make_array`:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `small_element = left + 1` and `big_element = right + 1`: These define the smallest and largest elements to be used in the current range.
   - `mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2` and `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`: These calculate the middle and non-middle parts of the range.

2. **Filling the array:**
   - The first half of the range (`left` to `left + mid - 1`) is filled with increasing values starting from `small_element`.
   - The second half of the range (`left + mid` to `right`) is filled with decreasing values starting from `big_element`.

3. **Clique assignment:**
   - Elements in the first half are assigned the current clique index.
   - Elements in the second half are also assigned the current clique index.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the example test case `n = 5`, `k = 4`:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2`
   - `arr = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - `cliquess = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

2. **First Iteration (i = 0):**
   - `make_array(0, 3, 1)`
   - `small_element = 1`, `big_element = 4`
   - `mid = 2`, `not_mid = 2`
   - `arr[0:2] = [1, 2]` and `cliquess[0:2] = [1, 1]`
   - `arr[2:4] = [4, 3]` and `cliquess[2:4] = [1, 1]`

3. **Second Iteration (i = 1):**
   - `make_array(4, 4, 2)`
   - `small_element = 5`, `big_element = 5`
   - `mid = 1`, `not_mid = 0`
   - `arr[4:5] = [5]` and `cliquess[4:5] = [2]`

4. **Final Arrays:**
   - `arr = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`
   - `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2]`

5. **Output:**
   - `print(*arr)` prints `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`
   - `print(cliques)` prints `2`
   - `print(*cliquess)` prints `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]`

This output is correct because:
- The graph can be partitioned into 2 cliques.
- The values in `arr` are distinct and within the range `[1, 5]`.
- The edges between vertices are added based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.

#### Verification:
- The program correctly assigns values to vertices and partitions them into the minimum number of cliques.
- The logic in `make_array` ensures that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
