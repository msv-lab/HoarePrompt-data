You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer t (indicating the number of subsequent test instances), followed by t sets of data. Each set consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. For each set, the function sorts the list of integers in non-decreasing order, calculates the sum of the differences between the last half and the first half of the sorted list, and prints this sum for each set.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and then pairing the largest and smallest elements to calculate the difference. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum beauty. For instance, consider the input:

```
4
10 5 3 8
```

The program would sort the array to `[3, 5, 8, 10]` and then calculate the beauty as `(10-3) + (8-5) = 7 + 3 = 10`. However, the optimal arrangement could be `[5, 10, 3, 8]`, which gives a beauty of `(10-5) + (8-3) = 5 + 5 = 10`.

To correctly solve this problem, Sasha needs to rearrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This requires a different approach, such as sorting the array and then pairing the smallest and largest elements appropriately.
