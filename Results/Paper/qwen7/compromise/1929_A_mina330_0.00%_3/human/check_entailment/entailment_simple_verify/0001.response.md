### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements: \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we should aim to have the largest possible values in positions where they can contribute positively to the sum, and the smallest possible values in positions where they can contribute negatively.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the beauty by pairing the smallest half of the sorted array with the largest half and summing the differences.
   - Specifically, for each pair \((a[i], a[len(a) - i - 1])\), it computes \(a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]\).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements.
   - By subtracting the smaller element from the larger one, we ensure that the differences are maximized.
   - However, the current implementation only considers pairs from the middle of the array. This means that the first and last elements are not considered in the calculation, which might lead to suboptimal results.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider the following edge case: \([1, 2, 3, 4]\). Sorting it gives \([1, 2, 3, 4]\). The current implementation would calculate the beauty as \((4 - 3) + (3 - 2) = 2\). However, the optimal beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to \([1, 4, 2, 3]\), giving a beauty of \((4 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 4\).

5. **Verification:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement do not cover all possible scenarios, particularly those involving edge cases like the one mentioned above.
   - The solution does not consider all possible permutations of the array to find the maximum beauty, but rather relies on sorting and pairing elements from the middle.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. While sorting helps in some cases, it does not guarantee the maximum beauty in all scenarios. A more comprehensive approach is needed to consider all permutations of the array to find the optimal arrangement.
