Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then summing the differences between the last half and the first half of the sorted array. This approach is correct because:

1. **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array, we ensure that the smallest values are paired with the largest values when calculating the differences.
2. **Summing Differences**: The sum of differences between the largest and smallest values in pairs maximizes the overall sum, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the beauty of the array.

Given the problem statement and the example provided, the program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum beauty of the array. It processes each test case as specified, sorts the array, and calculates the required sum of differences.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
