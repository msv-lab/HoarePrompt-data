Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of subsequent test instances, followed by t sets of data. Each set contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each set, the function returns a specific output based on the given data.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases where each case starts with an integer t indicating how many sub-cases follow, each sub-case involving an integer n and a list of n integers. The function processes these inputs and produces an output for each sub-case without accepting any parameters directly.
