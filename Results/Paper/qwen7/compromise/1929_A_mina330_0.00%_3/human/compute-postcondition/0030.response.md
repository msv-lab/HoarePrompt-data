Based on the initial state provided:

- `ntest` is an input integer.
- `itest` is equal to `ntest`.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `kq` is the sum of the elements at even indices subtracted from the sum of the elements at odd indices in the list `a`.
- `i` is the length of the list `a`.

The `print(kq)` statement will print the value of `kq`, which is the difference between the sum of elements at odd indices and the sum of elements at even indices in the list `a`.

Output: **kq (where kq is the sum of elements at odd indices in the list a minus the sum of elements at even indices in the list a)**
