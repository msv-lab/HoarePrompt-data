Output State: **ntest is an input integer, and t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**

Explanation: The code `ntest = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `ntest`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 500.
