Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ntest is an input integer, and t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    kq = 0
    for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
        kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
    print(kq)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `ntest` is an input integer, `itest` must be between 0 and `ntest`-1 inclusive, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1`, `len(a)` must be at least 2.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `kq` will hold the sum of the differences between the last half and the first half of the list `a`. Specifically, `kq` will be the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for each `i` from 0 up to `len(a) // 2 - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is `ntest`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `kq` is the sum of the elements at even indices subtracted from the sum of the elements at odd indices in the list `a`, `i` is `len(a)`.

In Natural Language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is such that `ntest` remains the same as the initial input integer, `itest` remains the same as `ntest`, `t` remains a positive integer within the range of 1 to 500, `n` remains the same as the initial input integer, `a` remains a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `kq` is calculated as the difference between the sum of elements at odd indices and the sum of elements at even indices in the list `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a` after the loop completes all its iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a) // 2`, `kq` is the sum of the elements at even indices subtracted from the sum of the elements at odd indices in the list `a`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the first half of the list `a`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. In each iteration, it updates `kq` by adding the difference between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the list. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to half the length of the list (rounded down if the length is odd), and `kq` will be the final result of the calculation described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
