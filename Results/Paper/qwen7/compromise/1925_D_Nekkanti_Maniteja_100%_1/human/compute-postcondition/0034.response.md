Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < m`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `m - 1`
   - `m` is `k`
   - `u` is an input integer (not part of the loop head)
   - `v` is an input integer (not part of the loop head)
   - `f` is an input integer (not part of the loop head)
   - `a` is `a + f` (not part of the loop head)

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `m`.
   - Since `m` is `k`, `i` must become `k`.
   - The condition `i < m` must still hold true, but since `i` is now `k` and `m` is `k`, the condition becomes `k < k`, which is false. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**Final State**:
- `i` must be `k`
- `m` must remain `k`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `k`, `m` is `k`**
