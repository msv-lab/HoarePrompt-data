The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `m` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.

Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must become 1. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to 1. The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

State: **`i` is 1, `m` is a positive integer**
