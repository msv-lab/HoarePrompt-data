Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is 2 * (c * i * c * k + c * a) + c * i * c * m + c * a**

Explanation: The variable `s` was initially defined as `2 * (c * i * c * k + c * a)`. After executing the line `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, the new value of `s` is updated to include the additional term `c * i * c * m + c * a`. Since the values of `i`, `k`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state, the updated expression for `s` is as given above.
