Output State: **`i` is `m`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is `m * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`**.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the same value as `m`, which is the total number of iterations the loop ran. The variable `k` will also be equal to `m`, indicating the loop completed `m` times. The variable `s` will be the sum of the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration, repeated `m` times. Therefore, `s` will be equal to `m * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`.
