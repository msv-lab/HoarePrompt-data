Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0.**

The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `a`. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, and `s` remain unchanged.
