Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * k + c * a` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=k-1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `n`, `m`, and `k` are now assigned the values of the input integers. However, the value of `i` remains `k`, and the calculation of `s` is not performed because the code snippet only reads input values and does not execute the summation logic. Therefore, the precondition that `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * k + c * a` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=k-1` is still valid, but the actual value of `s` is not computed yet.
