Output State: **`i` is `m`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is `4 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`**

Explanation: The initial state is given as `i` is `m`, `k` is equal to `m`, and `s` is `2 * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`. The code snippet updates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Since `i` is `m`, we substitute `m` for `i` in the expression. Thus, the new value of `s` becomes `2 * (c * m * c * m + c * a) + (c * m * c * m + c * a)`, which simplifies to `4 * (c * m * c * m + c * a)`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
