Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(m)`.
   - The variable `i` is being initialized and incremented within the loop.
   - The variable `m` is used as the upper bound for the range function.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `m + 1`.
   - `m` is set to `k`, where `k` is equal to `m`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`.
   - Since `i` starts at `m + 1`, the loop will not execute because `m + 1` is not less than `m`.

4. **Adjust the states to allow the loop to execute**:
   - To make the loop execute, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to a value less than `m`.

5. **Final state after adjustment**:
   - `i` should be set to a value less than `m`.
   - `m` remains unchanged since it is used as the upper bound for the range function.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**State:**
- `i` is `m + 1` (needs to be adjusted to a value less than `m`).
- `m` is `k` (remains unchanged).

To ensure the loop executes, let's assume `i` is set to `m - 1` (the largest possible value less than `m`).

**Final State:**
- `i` is `m - 1`.
- `m` is `k`.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is `m - 1`, `m` is `k`**.
