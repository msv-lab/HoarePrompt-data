Output State: **`i` is `m`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Since `i` is `m` and `k` must be equal to `m`, their values remain unchanged. The updated value of `s` is expressed as the original value of `s` plus the calculated expression.
