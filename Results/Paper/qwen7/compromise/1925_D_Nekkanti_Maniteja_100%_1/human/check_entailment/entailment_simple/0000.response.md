Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly initializes variables and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading `n`, `m`, and `k` for each case, which is correct.

2. **Modulo Operation and Inverse Calculation**:
   - The modulo constant `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\) is calculated using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`. This step is necessary because we need to use the inverse later in the calculation to avoid division issues in modular arithmetic.

3. **Sum Initialization**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 0, which will store the sum of friendship values after all excursions.

4. **Friendship Value Sum Calculation**:
   - The variable `a` is used to accumulate the sum of all friendship values `f_i` from the input. This is done correctly within the loop that processes each pair of friends.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values is calculated using the formula \(s = k \cdot c \cdot (k-1) \cdot c \cdot m + k \cdot c \cdot a\).
     - Here, `c` is the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
     - The term \(k \cdot c \cdot (k-1) \cdot c \cdot m\) accounts for the expected increase in friendship values due to the probability of choosing a friend pair.
     - The term \(k \cdot c \cdot a\) accounts for the initial friendship values being chosen at least once.
   - The result is taken modulo \(M\) to ensure it fits within the required constraints.

6. **Output**:
   - The result is printed correctly for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent errors in the code that would cause it to produce incorrect results based on the provided problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
