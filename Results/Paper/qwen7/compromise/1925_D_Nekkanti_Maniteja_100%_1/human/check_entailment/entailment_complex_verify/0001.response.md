### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program, particularly with the formula used to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Let's re-evaluate the program and the correct approach step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then processes `m` lines of input, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Calculation of Combinations**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children (`n * (n - 1) // 2`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`, which is correct.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The variable `a` accumulates the sum of all friendship values `f_i` for the pairs of friends.
   - This part is also correct.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The loop iterates `k` times, updating the sum `s` with the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - This formula is incorrect. The correct expected value for each pair of friends being chosen in any excursion is \(\frac{k}{\text{total pairs}}\), and the expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends over `k` excursions is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\).

5. **Final Output**:
   - The output is correctly taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correct Solution Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. The expected value for each pair of friends being chosen in any excursion is \(\frac{k}{\text{total pairs}}\), and the expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends over `k` excursions is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\).

The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values after `k` excursions is:
\[ \text{Expected Sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot f_i \right) \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ \text{Expected Sum} = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \]

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        expected_sum = (k * (k + 1) // 2) * a
        print(expected_sum % M)
```

### Conclusion:

The original program uses an incorrect formula to calculate the expected value, leading to an incorrect solution. The corrected program uses the correct formula to compute the expected sum of friendship values.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
