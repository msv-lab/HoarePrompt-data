The function processes a test case defined by three values: `t` (an integer between 1 and 5000), `n` (an integer between 2 and 50), and `p` (a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` and not equal to its index). Depending on the value of `n`, the function either prints `2` if a specific condition involving the list `v` is met, or prints `3` if no such condition is met. The function does not return any value but modifies a list `v` based on the input `p`.
