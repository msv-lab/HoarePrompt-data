Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the special case when \( n = 2 \) by printing 2 directly, as both friends would attend if invited.
- For \( n > 2 \), the program constructs a list `v` where `v[i]` represents the best friend of the friend indexed by `i`. This is done correctly by converting the input list `p` into the `v` list.
- The program then checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends' best friends. If such a pair is found (`v[v[v[i]]] == i`), it prints 2 because inviting these two friends will ensure both attend the party.
- If no such pair exists, the program prints 3, indicating that inviting three friends is necessary to ensure at least two friends attend the party.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
