### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step.

#### Problem Description and Input/Output:
- We need to determine the minimum number of invitations required so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
- For each test case, we read `n` (number of friends) and a list `p` where `p[i]` is the best friend of the `i`-th friend.
- If both the `i`-th friend and their best friend (`p[i]`) receive invitations, the `i`-th friend will come to the party.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1()` processes a single test case.
- It initializes a list `v` with zeros and updates it based on the input `p`.
- If `n == 2`, it prints `2`.
- Otherwise, it checks if there exists a pair `(i, p[i])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a pair exists, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints `3`.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   v = [0] * (n + 1)
   v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   This part correctly initializes the list `v` and reads the input for the current test case.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   ```python
   if n == 2:
       print(2)
   ```
   This handles the special case where `n == 2`. In this case, the program correctly prints `2`.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   ```python
   else:
       for i in range(1, n + 1):
           if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
               print(2)
               return
       print(3)
   ```
   This loop checks if there exists a pair `(i, p[i])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns. Otherwise, it prints `3`.

#### Evaluation Based on Function Summary:
- The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_1()`.
- The program correctly identifies the special case when `n == 2` and prints `2`.
- The general case logic correctly checks for the existence of a valid pair and prints `2` if such a pair exists. If no valid pair exists, it prints `3`.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:**
  ```plaintext
  5
  3 1 2 5 4
  ```
  - Friends: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  - Best friends: [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]
  - Valid pairs: (4, 5) -> Both 4 and 5 will come if invited.
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  ```plaintext
  4
  2 3 4 1
  ```
  - Friends: [1, 2, 3, 4]
  - Best friends: [2, 3, 4, 1]
  - No valid pairs: (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1) -> None of these pairs can both come.
  - Output: `3`

- **Test Case 3:**
  ```plaintext
  2
  2 1
  ```
  - Friends: [1, 2]
  - Best friends: [2, 1]
  - Valid pairs: (1, 2) -> Both 1 and 2 will come if invited.
  - Output: `2`

The program correctly handles all cases as described by the function summary.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided function summary.
