You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; p is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.

        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0 except the first element which is 0, and if `n == 2`, then `v` is a list of length 3 with the first element as 0 and the rest as integers converted from the input split. If `n != 2`, then the loop has been executed but no condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` was met for any i in the range 1 to n, so nothing was printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where no pair of friends can both receive invitations such that they both come to the party. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
4
2 3 4 1
```

In this case, if Monocarp sends invitations to friends 1 and 2, only friend 1 will come because friend 2's best friend (friend 3) did not receive an invitation. Similarly, sending invitations to friends 2 and 3 would result in only friend 2 coming. Sending invitations to friends 3 and 4 would result in only friend 3 coming. Therefore, it is impossible to have at least two friends come to the party with only three invitations.

The program incorrectly prints `3` in this scenario, which is not the minimum number of invitations needed. The correct output should be `3`, but the logic in the program does not account for the possibility that no valid pairs exist, leading to an incorrect solution.
