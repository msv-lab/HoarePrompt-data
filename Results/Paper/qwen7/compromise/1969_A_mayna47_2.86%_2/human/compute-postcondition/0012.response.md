Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0 except the first element which is 0, and if `n == 2`, then `v` is a list of length 3 with the first element as 0 and the rest as integers converted from the input split. If `n != 2`, then the loop has been executed but no condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` was met for any i in the range 1 to n, so nothing was printed.
