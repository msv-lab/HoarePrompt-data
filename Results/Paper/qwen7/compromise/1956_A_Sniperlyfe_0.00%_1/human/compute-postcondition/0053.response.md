Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` and `q` are positive integers, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the final input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the final input string and converted to integers, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the final `qs`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged. The list `p` will be updated based on the final input string, and `qs` will also be updated based on the final input string. The list `res` will contain the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the final `qs`, meaning it will have processed all elements in the final `qs`.
