Output State: **`qs` must have at least zero elements, `n` is the next element in `qs` if `qs` still has elements, otherwise `n` is undefined, `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the result of the function call `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. The values of `qs` and `p` remain unchanged. The variable `n` is set to the next element in `qs` if `qs` still has elements, otherwise `n` remains undefined. The function `func_1(n, p)` is called with the current value of `n` and `p`, and its return value is appended to the list `res`.
