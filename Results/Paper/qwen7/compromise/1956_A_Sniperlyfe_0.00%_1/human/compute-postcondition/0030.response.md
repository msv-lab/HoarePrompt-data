Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `qs` must have at least zero elements.
- `n` is the next element in `qs` if `qs` still has elements, otherwise `n` is undefined.
- `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

### Loop Head:
```
for n in qs:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is derived from `qs`.
   - If `qs` is not empty, `n` is the next element in `qs`.
   - If `qs` is empty, `n` is undefined.

2. **Variable `qs`:**
   - `qs` is the collection from which `n` is taken.
   - After each iteration, `qs` is expected to lose its first element (if it had one).

3. **Variable `res`:**
   - `res` is a list that gets updated with the result of `func_1(n, p)` after each iteration.
   - The state of `res` does not depend on the loop head but rather on the loop body, so it doesn't need to be adjusted here.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- Since `n` is derived from `qs`, and `qs` loses its first element after each iteration, `n` will be the next element in `qs` if `qs` still has elements.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least one element left.

### New State:
- `qs` must have at least one element.
- `n` is the next element in `qs` (the first element of `qs`).
- `res` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

### Final State:
State: **`qs` must have at least one element, `n` is the first element in `qs`, `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**
