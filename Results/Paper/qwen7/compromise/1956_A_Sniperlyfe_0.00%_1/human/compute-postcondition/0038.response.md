Output State: **`qs` is a list of integers from the new input string, `n` is the second element of `qs` (or undefined if `qs` has fewer than 2 elements), `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to the first element of `qs`, `k` and `q` are lists of integers from the input split, `p` is a list of integers from the new input split.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input string, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `p`. The other variables (`qs`, `n`, `res`, `k`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
