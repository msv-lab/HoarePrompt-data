Output State: **`qs` is updated to a list of integers from the new input string, `n` is the second element of `qs` (or undefined if `qs` has fewer than 2 elements), `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to the first element of `qs`, `k` and `q` are lists of integers from the input split, `p` is a list of integers from the new input split.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns this list to `qs`. This updates the value of `qs` to a list of integers from the new input string. The value of `n` remains as the second element of `qs` (or undefined if `qs` has fewer than 2 elements). The value of `res` remains unchanged as it was defined before this code. The values of `k` and `q` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this code. The value of `p` is updated to a list of integers from the new input split.
