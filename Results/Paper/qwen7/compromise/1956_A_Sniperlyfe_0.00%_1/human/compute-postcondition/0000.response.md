Output State: **`k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100; `p` is a list of k positive integers representing the sequence a where 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100; `qs` is a list of q positive integers representing n_i where 1 <= n_i <= 100; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.**

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is an integer) to the variable `t`. Since the initial state of `n` was a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and the input can also be any integer within this range, we rename `n` to `t` to reflect the new assignment. All other variables remain unchanged.
