Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `n`.
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `qs`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - `qs` must have at least two elements.
   - `n` is the second element of `qs`.
   - `res` now contains the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `k` and `q` are lists of integers from the input split.
   - `p` is a list of integers from the new input split.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be the next element in `qs` after the current `n`.
   - Since `n` was the second element, the next element in `qs` would be the third element.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - `n` will now be the third element of `qs`.
   - `res` will contain the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` after the next iteration.
   - `qs` must still have at least two elements (since it needs to have at least three elements to continue the loop).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`qs` must have at least three elements, `n` is the third element of `qs`, `res` now contains the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `k` and `q` are lists of integers from the input split, `p` is a list of integers from the new input split**
