Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100; `p` is a list of k positive integers representing the sequence a where 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100; `qs` is a list of q positive integers representing n_i where 1 <= n_i <= 100; `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = []
    for n in qs:
        res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (with all elements removed), `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, and `func_1(n, p)` has been appended to `res` for every element in `qs`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged. The list `p` and `qs` will be empty since all elements have been processed. The list `res` will contain the result of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in the original `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `qs` is a list of integers from the new input string, `n` is the first element of `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element of `qs`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `qs` will still hold the list of integers from the new input string, `n` will be the first element of `qs` (or undefined if `qs` is empty), and `res` will be a list where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, p)` for every `n` in `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `res` now contains the values returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, `n` is the last element of `qs`, and `qs` still has at least two elements.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `res` will be a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to every element `n` in `qs`. The loop continues until all elements in `qs` have been processed, with `n` taking on each successive element of `qs`. The other variables (`k`, `q`, and `p`) remain in their initial or previously unchanged states.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
