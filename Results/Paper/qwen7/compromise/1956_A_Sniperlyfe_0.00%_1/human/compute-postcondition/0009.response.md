Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for n in qs:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` is the first element in `qs`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `qs`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` was the first element in `qs`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `n` was the first element in `qs` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `n` will be the second element in `qs`.
   - All other variables (`t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, `res`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (with the first element used in the previous iteration), `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` (where `n` was the first element in `qs`), `n` is the second element in `qs`.**
