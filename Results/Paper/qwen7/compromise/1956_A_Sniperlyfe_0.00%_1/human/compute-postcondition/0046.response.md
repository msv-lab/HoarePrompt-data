Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `res` contains the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` is the third element of `qs`.
   - `qs` still has at least two elements.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - `res` is a result from the function call `func_1(n, p)`. Since `res` is not explicitly defined, we need to infer its nature based on the context.
   - `n` is the third element of `qs`, so if `qs` is a list, `n = qs[2]`.
   - `map(str, res)` applies the `str` function to each element in `res`, converting each element to a string.
   - `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these string representations with a space character.

Given that `res` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, and without knowing the exact nature of `res` (whether it's a list, tuple, or other iterable), we can assume that `res` is an iterable of some kind. Let's denote the elements of `res` as `r1, r2, ..., rn`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will join the string representations of the elements in `res` with spaces.

Therefore, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `res`.

Output: **' '.join(map(str, res)) (where res is the result of func_1(n, p) and n is the third element of qs)**
