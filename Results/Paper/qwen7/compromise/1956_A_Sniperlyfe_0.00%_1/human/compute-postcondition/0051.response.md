Output State: `res` now contains the values returned by `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, `n` is the last element of `qs`, and `qs` still has at least two elements.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `res` will be a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to every element `n` in `qs`. The loop continues until all elements in `qs` have been processed, with `n` taking on each successive element of `qs`. The other variables (`k`, `q`, and `p`) remain in their initial or previously unchanged states.
