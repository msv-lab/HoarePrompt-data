The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of positive integers `p`. It repeatedly decreases `n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`. After the loop terminates, it returns `n`, which is a non-negative integer strictly less than the minimum value in `p`.
