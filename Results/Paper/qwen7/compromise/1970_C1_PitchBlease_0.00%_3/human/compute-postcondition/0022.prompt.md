Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the next node and its distance, `current` is the start node, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`. The current node is not equal to the target.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `queue` is a deque containing at least one tuple (neighbor, dist + 1), `current` is start, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the elements `start` and `neighbor`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `queue` is a deque containing at least one tuple (neighbor_last, dist + 1) and an additional tuple (neighbor, dist + 1), `current` is `neighbor_last`, `dist` is 0, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `neighbor_last`, and `neighbor`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `queue` is a deque containing at least one tuple (neighbor_last, dist + 1), an additional tuple (next_neighbor, dist + 1), and a new tuple (neighbor, dist + 1); `current` is the next neighbor in the tree; `dist` is 0; `start` is an integer representing the starting node; `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree; `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `neighbor_last`, `neighbor`, and `neighbor_last` is added to `visited` if `neighbor` is not already in `visited`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
