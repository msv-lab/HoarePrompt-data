Output State: All neighbors of the nodes starting from the initial node have been visited, and the `queue` contains tuples of all unvisited neighbors along with their distances from the initial node. The `visited` set includes all nodes that have been processed, ensuring no node is visited more than once. The `current` variable holds the last node that was processed before the loop terminated, which could be the target node or any other node that has all its neighbors visited.

This means that the algorithm (likely a breadth-first search) has explored as far as possible from the initial node, and the `queue` now contains information about the shortest path distances to all reachable nodes.
