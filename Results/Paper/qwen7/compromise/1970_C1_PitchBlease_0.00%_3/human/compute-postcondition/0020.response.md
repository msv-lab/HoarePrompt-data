Output State: **`queue` is now a deque containing at least one tuple (neighbor_last, dist + 1), an additional tuple (next_neighbor, dist + 1), and a new tuple (neighbor, dist + 1); `current` is the next neighbor in the tree; `dist` is 0; `start` is an integer representing the starting node; `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree; `visited` is a set containing the elements `start`, `neighbor_last`, `neighbor`, and `neighbor`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` to the `queue`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
