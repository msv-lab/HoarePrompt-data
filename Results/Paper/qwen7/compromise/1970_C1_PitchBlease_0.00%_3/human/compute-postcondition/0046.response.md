The loop condition is `while queue:`. This means the loop continues as long as the `queue` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the `queue` is empty, indicating that all nodes have been processed. Therefore, the loop cannot execute one more time because the condition `queue` is not satisfied.

Since the loop cannot execute one more time, no adjustments are needed for the states of the objects in the loop head.

State: **`current` will be the last node that was dequeued from the queue, `visited` will contain all nodes that were visited during the entire execution of the loop, `queue` will be empty, and `dist` value will represent the shortest distance from the initial node to the `current` node.**
