Output State: **`visited` contains the `neighbor` element; `queue` contains a tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple containing the `neighbor` and `dist + 1` to the `queue`. The `visited` list remains unchanged and still contains the `neighbor` element. The `queue` now includes the new tuple.
