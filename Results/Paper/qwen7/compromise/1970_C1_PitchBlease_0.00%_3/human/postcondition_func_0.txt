The function accepts an integer `n`, a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of a tree with exactly two leaves, and an integer `start` as the starting node. It constructs an undirected graph representation of the tree, identifies the two leaves, calculates the shortest path distances from the start node to each leaf using Breadth-First Search (BFS), and determines the winner of the game based on these distances. If either distance is even, the function returns "Ron"; otherwise, it returns "Hermione".
