Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, `val` is an empty list, `m` is equal to 2, `a3` is the first integer input, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers input, the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l1` is a list with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
