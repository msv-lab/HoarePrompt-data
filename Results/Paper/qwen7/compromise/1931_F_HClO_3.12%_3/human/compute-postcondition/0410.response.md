Output State: **`m` is 4, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, ..., or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The variable `m` is decremented by 1, making it 4 since it was at least 5 initially. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the operation `m -= 1`.
