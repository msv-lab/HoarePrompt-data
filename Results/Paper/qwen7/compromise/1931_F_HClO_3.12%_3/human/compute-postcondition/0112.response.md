Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, `val` is an empty list, `m` is equal to 2, `a3` is the first integer input, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers input, `l2` has had the element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the element `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, `m`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged from their initial states.
