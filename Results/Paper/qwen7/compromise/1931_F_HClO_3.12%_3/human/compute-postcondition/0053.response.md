Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 1 and 0 respectively, or 0 and 1 respectively; `idx1` and `idx2` are either `i` and -1, or -1 and `i` respectively; `n` is greater than 1; the value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`; `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`; both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified, the `break` statement simply exits the current context, which could be a loop or an if-else block. The values of the variables `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `n`, `i`, and the conditions involving `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged.
