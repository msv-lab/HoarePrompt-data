Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(a3, l3)` which is unpacked from `val`. Therefore, the variables involved are `a3` and `l3`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `l3` contains at least one element. If `l3` becomes empty, the loop will terminate.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer.
   - `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `l3` must still contain at least one element.
   - `a3` remains the same since it is derived from the initial input and does not change within the loop.
   - `l3` will be the list of the remaining integers after removing the first element (which was `a3`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, and `l3` must have at least one element.**
