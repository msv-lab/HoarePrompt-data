Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is either `-1` or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `idx1 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. The other variables (`m`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
