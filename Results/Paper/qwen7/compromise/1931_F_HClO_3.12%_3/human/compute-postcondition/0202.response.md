Output State: **`idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `i` is 1**.

Explanation: The code sets `idx1` and `idx2` both equal to the current value of `i`, which is 1. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, and `i` are updated, while the other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t`) retain their original values.
