Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable involved here is `m`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `m - 2` is a positive integer, meaning `m` must be at least 3.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Based on the given postconditions, we know:
   - If `idx1 < idx2`, then `val` is an empty list, `l` references a list `l2` with an element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `m` must be at least 3.
   - If `idx1 >= idx2`, then `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` references a list `l1` with an element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `m` must be at least 3.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 3 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m` being at least 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be at least 3**
