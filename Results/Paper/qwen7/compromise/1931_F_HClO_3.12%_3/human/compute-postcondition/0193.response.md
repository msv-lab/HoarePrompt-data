Postcondition: **`idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, and `i` is 0. If the condition `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
