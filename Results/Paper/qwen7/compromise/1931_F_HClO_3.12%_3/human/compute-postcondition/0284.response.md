Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(a3, l3)` in the `for` loop. This means the variables `a3` and `l3` are the only ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as the condition `l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]` holds true. This means that `l3` should not be equal to the list comprehension that filters out `a3` from `l`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer.
   - `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to continue, `l3` must not be equal to the filtered list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`.
   - If `l3` is already equal to the filtered list, the loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `a3` remains the same in each iteration (it is the first integer from the input), it does not change.
   - `l3` needs to be adjusted such that it is not equal to the filtered list comprehension. To ensure the loop continues, `l3` should contain at least one element that is equal to `a3`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `l3` contains at least one element that is equal to `a3`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers that includes at least one element equal to `a3`**.
