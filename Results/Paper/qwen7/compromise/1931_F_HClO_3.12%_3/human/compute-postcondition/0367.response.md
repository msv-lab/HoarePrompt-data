Postcondition: `m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]` or `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
