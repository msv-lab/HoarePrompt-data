Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is at least 5.
- `a3` is the first integer from the first input converted to `int`.
- `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input converted to `int`.
- The current list `l3` is not equal to a new list created by taking all elements from `l` except those equal to `a3`.

The `print('no')` statement simply prints the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
