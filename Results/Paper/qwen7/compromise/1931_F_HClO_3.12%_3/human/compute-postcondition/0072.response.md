Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` are either `i` and `i`, or `i+1` and `i`, or `i` and `i+1`.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the loop.
   - `l1[i + 1 + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + 1 + p2]`.
   - If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is true, then the condition remains unchanged.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i` in `range(n - 1)`. This means `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-2`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n-2`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n-1`.

5. **Adjust the other variables**:
   - `p1` and `p2` remain the same as they were not modified within the loop.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` depend on `i` and `max(p1, p2)`. Since `i` changes to `n-1`, `idx1` and `idx2` will change accordingly.
   - `n` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
   - The conditions `l1[i + 1 + p1] != l2[i + 1 + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop.

6. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` changes to `n-1`.
   - `idx1` and `idx2` change based on the new value of `i` and `max(p1, p2)`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` and `n-1`, or `n` and `n-1`, or `n-1` and `n`; `n` is greater than 1; if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `l1[i + 1 + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + 1 + p2]`, and if the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is true, then the condition remains unchanged.**
