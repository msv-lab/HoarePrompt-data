Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i` or `i+1` or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1` or `i` or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in.
