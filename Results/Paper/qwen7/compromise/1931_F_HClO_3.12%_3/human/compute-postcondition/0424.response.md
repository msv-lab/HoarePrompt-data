Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input split, `val` is a list containing three tuples `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3), (a3, l3)], `m` is equal to 4**.

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` adds a new tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `val` originally contained two tuples, after appending another tuple, it now contains three tuples. All other variables remain unchanged.
