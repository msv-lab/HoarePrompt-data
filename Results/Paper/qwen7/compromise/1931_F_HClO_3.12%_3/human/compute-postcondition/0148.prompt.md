Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from each of the inputs converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input converted to int, `val` is a list containing five tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the second tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the third tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the fourth tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the fifth tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input converted to int. If the current list `l3` is not equal to a new list created by taking all elements from `l` except those equal to `a3`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input converted to int, and the next pair `(a4, l4)` is valid where `l4` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input, excluding those equal to `a4`. If `l3` is not a list of integers excluding `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the second integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input, excluding those equal to `a4`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of remaining integers from the first input excluding those equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part specified, so the postcondition remains as described in the if part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
