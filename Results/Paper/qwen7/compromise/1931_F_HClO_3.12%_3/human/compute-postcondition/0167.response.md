Output State: `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, input has been taken 3 times but not stored or used.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is `m-2` times), the value of `m` must still be greater than or equal to 3, as it was after each iteration up to the third. Additionally, the input has been requested 3 times during these iterations, but the inputs themselves are not stored or used within the loop.
