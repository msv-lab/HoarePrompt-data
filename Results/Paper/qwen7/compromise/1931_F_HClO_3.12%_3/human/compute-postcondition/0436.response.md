Output State: **`a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, and `m` is equal to 4. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `a3`, `l3`, `val`, or `m`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block we are currently inside. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values remain unchanged.
