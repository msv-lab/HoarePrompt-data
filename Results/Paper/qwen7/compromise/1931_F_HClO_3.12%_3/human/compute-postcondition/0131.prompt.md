Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, `val` is a list. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then `val` is an empty list, `l` references a list `l2` with an element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`. Otherwise, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)` or `l` references a list `l1` with an element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `m` is equal to 1, where `a3` is the first integer input and `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers input.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` must be at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input, `val` is a list containing one tuple (a3, l3)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be at least 4, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`), and the third tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
