Output State: **`m` must be at least 4, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `val` is a list containing one tuple: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts using `map(int, input().split())`. The first part is assigned to `a3`, and the rest is unpacked into `l3`. The original conditions and values of `m` and `val` remain unchanged, but now `a3` and `l3` have specific values based on the input.
