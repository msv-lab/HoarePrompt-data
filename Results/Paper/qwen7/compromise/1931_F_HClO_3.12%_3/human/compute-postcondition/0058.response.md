Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either `i+1` and `-1`, `-1` and `i+1`, or `i+1` and `i+1`; `n` is greater than 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `l1[i + 1 + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + 1 + p2]`**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the conditions specified within that loop or if statement are no longer being checked. However, the values of the variables `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `n`, and the condition involving `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
