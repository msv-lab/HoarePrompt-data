Postcondition: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either `i` and `-1`, `-1` and `i`, or `i` and `i`; `n` is greater than 1; the value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`; `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`; if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
