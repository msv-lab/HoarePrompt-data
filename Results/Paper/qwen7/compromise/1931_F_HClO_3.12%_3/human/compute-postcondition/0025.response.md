Output State: **`a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `m`, `n` retain their original values; `idx1` is -1; `idx2` is -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, both to -1. This assignment does not affect the values of `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `m`, and `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values.
