Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is explicitly given as 2.
- `idx1` and `idx2` are defined such that `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, ..., or `-1`, and `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`. Given that `i = n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` can take values within this range.
- `p1` and `p2` are either 1 or 0.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as `n - 2`.
- `val` is an empty list.
- `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`.

The print statement in question is simply:

```python
print('yes')
```

This statement will print the string `'yes'` directly without any reference to the variables `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, `i`, or `val`.

Output: **yes**
