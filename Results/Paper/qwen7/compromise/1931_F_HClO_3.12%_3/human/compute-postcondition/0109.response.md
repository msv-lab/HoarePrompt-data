Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, `val` is an empty list, `m` is equal to 2, `a3` is the first integer input, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers input, the index of `a3` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `l1` is a list with `a3` inserted at position `idx2`, `l` is `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` simply assigns the value of `l1` to `l`. Since `l1` was defined as a list with `a3` inserted at position `idx2`, `l` now holds the same list. All other variables remain unchanged.
