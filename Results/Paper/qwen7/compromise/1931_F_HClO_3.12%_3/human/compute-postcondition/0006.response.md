Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is 1, and we continue the loop or process.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The program continues waiting for user input, but the specific nature of the input is not specified in the given code snippet.
