Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are both `i`; `n` is greater than 1; if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `l1[i + 1 + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + 1 + p2]; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or if statement it is within. All the conditions and states of the variables before the `break` statement remain the same.
