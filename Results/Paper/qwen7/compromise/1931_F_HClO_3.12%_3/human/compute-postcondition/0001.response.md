State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` used in the range function.
2. For the loop to execute, the range function needs a positive integer as its argument.
3. The initial state of `t` being an input integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute.
4. Therefore, `t` must be adjusted to be greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

Thus, the state needs to be modified to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
