Postcondition: `a3` is the first element of the second tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the second tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, and `m` is equal to 4. If `l3` is not a list where all elements are not equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
