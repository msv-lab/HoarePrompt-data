Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m - 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `m` and the range calculation `m - 2`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `m - 2` is greater than or equal to 1 (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the stop value).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be at least 4.
   - `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int.
   - `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int.
   - `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on `m - 2`, we need to ensure that `m - 2` is still greater than or equal to 1.
   - Given that `m` must be at least 4, let's assume `m` is currently 4 (the minimum value). After the current iteration, `m` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify `m` directly.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 5 (so that `m - 2` is at least 3).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`m` must be at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from input converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input converted to int, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`).**
