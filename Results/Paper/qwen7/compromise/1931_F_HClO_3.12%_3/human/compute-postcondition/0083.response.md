Postcondition: `p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` and `n-1`, or `n` and `n-1`, or `n-1` and `n`; `n` is greater than 1; if `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` and `idx2` are negative, no action is taken and the original values of `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `n` are retained.
