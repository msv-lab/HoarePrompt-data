Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the last integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is an empty list, and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from the first input converted to int, `m` is the second integer from the first input converted to int.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. The first integer becomes `n`, and the second integer becomes `m`. The other variables (`a3`, `l3`, and `t`) remain unchanged according to their initial states.
