Postcondition: `p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either both `i`, or `n-1` and `n-1`, or `n` and `n-1`, or `n-1` and `n`; `n` is greater than 1. If the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
