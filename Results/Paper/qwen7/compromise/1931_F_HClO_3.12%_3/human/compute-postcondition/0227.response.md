Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block mentioned, it implies that the `break` statement is breaking out of the context where these assignments were made. Given the conditions:

- If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` remains 2 and `p1` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `p2` is set to 1.

Since the `break` statement is executed, the conditions for setting `p1` and `p2` are irrelevant, and the `break` statement itself does not change the values of `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, or `i`. Therefore, the values remain as specified in the conditions before the `break` statement was executed.
