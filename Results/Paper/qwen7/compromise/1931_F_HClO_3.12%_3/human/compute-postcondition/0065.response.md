Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are `i+1` and `i`; `n` is greater than 1; `p2` is 1; `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1` leads to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement; `l1[i + 1 + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + 1 + p2]`.**

Explanation: The code sets `p2` to 1. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `p2` is now explicitly set to 1, while `p1` can still be 0 or 1, and the rest of the conditions and variables remain as stated in the initial condition.
