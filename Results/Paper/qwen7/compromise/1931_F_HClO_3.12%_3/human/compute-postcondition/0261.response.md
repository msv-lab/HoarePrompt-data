Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer entered, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers entered, `m` retains its original value, `t` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `m`, and `t` remain unchanged. `val` now contains one tuple with `a3` as the first element and `l3` as the second element.
