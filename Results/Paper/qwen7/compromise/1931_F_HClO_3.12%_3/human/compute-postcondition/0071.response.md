Postcondition: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either `i` and `i`, or `i+1` and `i`, or `i` and `i+1`; `n` is greater than 1; if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `l1[i + 1 + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + 1 + p2]`, and if the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is true, then the condition remains unchanged.**
