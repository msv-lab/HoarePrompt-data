Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable here is `m`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `m`**: From the given state, `m` is initially set to 1.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop `for _ in range(m - 2)` will execute if `m - 2` is greater than or equal to 0. Given that `m` is 1, `m - 2` equals -1, which means the loop will not execute because the range function will generate an empty sequence (no iterations).

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will not execute due to the current value of `m`, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can potentially execute. This means we need to increase `m` so that `m - 2` is non-negative.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to be greater than 2.

**Final State**:
State: **`m` must be greater than 2**
