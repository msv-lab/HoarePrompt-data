Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` is `i`; `idx2` is either `i+1` and `-1`, `-1` and `i+1`, or `i+1` and `i+1`; `n` is greater than 1; if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `l1[i + 1 + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + 1 + p2]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`, changing its value but not affecting the values of `p1`, `p2`, `idx2`, `n`, the condition for breaking out of the loop, or the comparison between `l1[i + 1 + p1]` and `l2[i + 1 + p2]`.
