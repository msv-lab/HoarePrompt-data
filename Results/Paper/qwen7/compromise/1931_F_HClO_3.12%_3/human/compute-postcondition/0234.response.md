Output State: `idx1` and `idx2` are both 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, and `i` is `n-2`.

**Explanation**: After the loop executes all its iterations (from `i=0` to `i=n-2`), the conditions inside the loop ensure that `idx1` and `idx2` are set to 2 if the specific conditions are met within the loop. The values of `p1` and `p2` will depend on whether the conditions inside the nested if statements are satisfied during the loop's execution. Since the loop breaks when the conditions `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]` are met, and given that the loop runs from `i=0` to `i=n-2`, `i` will be `n-2` at the end of the loop. All other variables (`a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
