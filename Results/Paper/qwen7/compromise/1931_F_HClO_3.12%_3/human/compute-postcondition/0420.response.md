Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input split, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `m` must be greater than 3**.

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`. The original list `l3` and the tuple in `val` remain unchanged. The condition that `m` must be greater than 3 is not affected by this code.
