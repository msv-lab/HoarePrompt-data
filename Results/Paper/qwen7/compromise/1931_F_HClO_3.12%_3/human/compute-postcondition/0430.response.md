Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`.
- `m` is equal to 4.
- The current value of `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension of all elements in `l` excluding `a3`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'no'` without any dependency on the values of `a3`, `l3`, `val`, `m`, or any other variables. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
