Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input split, `val` is a list containing two tuples `[(a3, l3), (a3, l3)]`, `m` must be greater than 3**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `val` originally contained one tuple, after appending another tuple with the same elements, `val` now contains two identical tuples. All other variables remain unchanged.
