Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` is `i`; `idx2` is either `n-1` and `n-1`, or `n` and `n-1`, or `n-1` and `n`; `n` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `idx1 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `idx2`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` remains unexecuted because the code only updates `idx1`.
