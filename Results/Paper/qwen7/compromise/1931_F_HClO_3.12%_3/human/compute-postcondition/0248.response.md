Based on the initial state provided:

- `idx1` and `idx2` are both 2.
- `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `val` is an empty list.
- `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values.
- `m` is equal to 2.

The print statement is simply `print('yes')`.

Since the print statement is explicitly printing the string `'yes'`, the output will be:

Output: **yes**
