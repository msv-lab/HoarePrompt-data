Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the last integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is an empty list, and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from the first input converted to int, `m` is the second integer from the first input converted to int, and we continue the loop or process.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the values of `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The precondition that an input prompt is shown to the user also remains valid.
