Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, ..., or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split and converted to integers, `l2` has had the element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l` is a reference to `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` simply assigns `l2` to `l`. This does not change the contents of `l2`, nor does it affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, `i`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, and the relationship between `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged. The only change is that `l` now references the same list as `l2`.
