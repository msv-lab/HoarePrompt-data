Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, or `-1`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
