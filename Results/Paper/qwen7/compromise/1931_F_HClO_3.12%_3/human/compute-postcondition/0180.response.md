Output State: **`idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `a1` is `l2[i + p2]`, `a2` is `l1[i + p1]`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `idx1 = idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to both `idx1` and `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
