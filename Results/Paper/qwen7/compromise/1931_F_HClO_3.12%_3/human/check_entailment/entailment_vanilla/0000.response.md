Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` (number of participants and number of screenshots).
   - It then processes each screenshot.

2. **Single Screenshot Case (`m == 1`):**
   - If only one screenshot is provided, the program prints 'yes' immediately.
   - This part seems correct because if there's only one screenshot, the order must match the participant's view.

3. **Multiple Screenshots Case (`m > 1`):**
   - The program compares the first two screenshots.
   - It removes the author from both lists and checks if the remaining lists are equal.
     - If they are not equal, it prints 'no' and moves to the next test case.
   - If they are equal, it proceeds to check further screenshots.

4. **Index Comparison:**
   - The program tries to find the indices where the author of the screenshot appears in the other list.
   - If found, it inserts the author back into the list at the appropriate position.
   - If not found, it handles the case with more than two screenshots by comparing the third screenshot and adjusting the list accordingly.

5. **Validation of Remaining Screenshots:**
   - After processing the initial comparisons, the program validates the remaining screenshots against the constructed list.
   - If any screenshot does not match the expected order, it prints 'no'.
   - If all screenshots match, it prints 'yes'.

### Key Points to Verify:
- **Handling Single Screenshot:** Correctly identified as 'yes'.
- **Equal Remaining Lists:** Correctly identified as 'no' when lists do not match.
- **Index Matching and Insertion:** Logic to insert authors back into the list seems correct.
- **Validation of Remaining Screenshots:** Ensures all subsequent screenshots match the constructed list.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if there is a consistent order of participants across all screenshots. The steps are logically sound and handle the given constraints appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
