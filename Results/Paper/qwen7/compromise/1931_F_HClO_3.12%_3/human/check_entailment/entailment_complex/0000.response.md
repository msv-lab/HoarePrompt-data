### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It then processes `m` screenshots, where each screenshot is represented as a list of `n` distinct integers.

2. **Initial Checks**: The function handles the case when `m == 1` by simply printing 'yes' and continuing to the next test case. This is correct because if only one screenshot is provided, it's trivially possible that all participants see the same order.

3. **Comparing Screenshot Orders**: The function compares the orders of the first two screenshots (`a1` and `a2`). It removes the author from both lists and checks if the remaining lists are equal. If they are not equal, it prints 'no' and continues to the next test case. This step ensures that the initial comparison is done correctly.

4. **Finding Insertion Points**: The function attempts to find the correct insertion points for the author of the first screenshot in the second screenshot's list or vice versa. This is done by iterating through the lists and identifying the positions where the author appears. If the author is found in the wrong position, it calculates the correct insertion point and inserts the author accordingly.

5. **Handling Multiple Screenshots**: After handling the first two screenshots, the function processes the remaining screenshots. It checks if the remaining lists match the modified list by removing the current author. If any of the remaining lists do not match, it prints 'no'.

6. **Final Output**: The function prints 'yes' only if all screenshots can be aligned with the same order, or 'no' if any of the comparisons fail.

Given the detailed steps and the logical flow, the annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the function is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
