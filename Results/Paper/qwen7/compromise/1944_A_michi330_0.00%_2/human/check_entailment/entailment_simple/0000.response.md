Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most `k` bridges. Let's analyze the logic of the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
2. **Condition Check**: 
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the program prints `1`. This means that if Dominater can destroy at least `n - 1` bridges, Everule will only be able to stay on island 1 because destroying `n - 1` bridges would disconnect island 1 from all other islands.
   - Otherwise, the program prints `n - 1`. This implies that if `k` is less than `n - 1`, Everule can still visit all other islands except possibly island 1, depending on which bridges are destroyed.

Given the constraints and the logic:
- When `k >= n - 1`, the program correctly outputs `1` because destroying `n - 1` bridges ensures that island 1 is disconnected from all other islands.
- When `k < n - 1`, the program also correctly outputs `n - 1` because even with `k` bridges destroyed, Everule can still potentially visit all other islands.

This logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
