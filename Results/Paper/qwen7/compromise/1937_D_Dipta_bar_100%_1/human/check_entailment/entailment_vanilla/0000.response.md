Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to compute the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - However, the logic implemented in `func_1` is flawed and does not accurately simulate the pinball movement as described in the problem statement.

3. **Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function attempts to precompute times for pinballs starting from the left and right ends of the grid, but it does not correctly handle the inversion of directions and the actual movement of the pinball.
   - The variables `A` and `B` are intended to store these precomputed times, but they are not filled correctly.
   - The logic to update `A` and `B` based on the direction of the pinball is incorrect and does not account for the inversion rule properly.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main loop in the `for` block after `func_1` tries to use the precomputed values to determine the time for each pinball starting position.
   - However, this approach is fundamentally flawed because the precomputed values do not reflect the actual movement of the pinball due to the inversion rule.

### Detailed Issues:
- **Incorrect Precomputation:**
  - The `A` and `B` arrays are meant to store the time taken for pinballs starting from the left and right ends, respectively. However, the logic to fill these arrays is incorrect and does not follow the problem's rules.
- **Inversion Rule Not Properly Handled:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the inversion of directions when the pinball moves. Each time the pinball moves, the direction should be reversed, but this is not done in the current implementation.
- **Complexity and Edge Cases:**
  - The solution attempts to handle complex cases with precomputation, but this approach is overly complicated and does not work as expected.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in the logic and the precomputation, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
