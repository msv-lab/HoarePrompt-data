Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this by splitting the string into two parts: moving right (`>` characters) and moving left (`<` characters).
3. It uses two lists, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative distances traveled in each direction.
4. The code then iterates through the string again, using the precomputed distances to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
5. The execution summary indicates that the function correctly processes the string and computes the required times, but the detailed logic and formulas used in the code suggest it might be overly complex and potentially incorrect for some edge cases.

However, upon closer inspection, the core logic of the code seems to be attempting to correctly compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. The formulas used to calculate `a` and `b` seem to be derived from the positions and counts of `>` and `<` characters, which is a valid approach.

Given that the provided execution summary matches the expected behavior and the logic appears to be sound, the program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
