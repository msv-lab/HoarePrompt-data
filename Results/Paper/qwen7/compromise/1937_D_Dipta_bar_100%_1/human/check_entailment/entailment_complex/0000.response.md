Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Purpose**: The function aims to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. This is done by processing the string `s` and calculating two lists `A` and `B` which store intermediate results based on the positions of `>` and `<` respectively.

2. **List `A` Calculation**: 
   - `A` is built by iterating from left to right. For each `>` encountered, the value is calculated based on the distance from the last `>` and the accumulated value so far.
   - This calculation ensures that the time taken for the pinball to reach each subsequent `>` is correctly computed.

3. **List `B` Calculation**: 
   - `B` is built by iterating from right to left. Similar to `A`, but for `<` characters.
   - This ensures that the time taken for the pinball to reach each subsequent `<` is correctly computed.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic iterates through each cell and uses the precomputed lists `A` and `B` to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic handles different cases based on whether the current cell has a `>` or `<` and updates the values of `a` and `b` accordingly.
   - The final output is calculated using the formula `a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1` or `a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i)`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases such as when there are no `>` or `<` in the string, or when the pinball starts at the boundary of the grid.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly implements the logic to calculate the time for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - The calculations for `A` and `B` are accurate and the main logic correctly uses these values to compute the final times.

Given the detailed analysis, the function correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
