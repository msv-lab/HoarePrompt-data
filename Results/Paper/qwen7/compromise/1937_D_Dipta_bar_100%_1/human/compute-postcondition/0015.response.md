Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and returns the count of balanced pairs of angle brackets in the string.**

This means the function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input, where `s` contains only the characters '<' and '>'. The functionality of the function is to count and return the number of balanced pairs of angle brackets (i.e., "<>" pairs) within the string.
