Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over `range(0, n)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, the initial value of `i` should be set to 0.

3. **Determine the value of `n`**: The value of `n` is not explicitly given in the initial state, but it is derived from the length of `B`, which is stored in the variable `r`. Therefore, `n` must be equal to `r`.

4. **Check other variables**: The variables `l`, `idx_B`, and `B` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. They remain unchanged during the loop execution.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should be 0 and `n` should be equal to `r`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is equal to `r`**
