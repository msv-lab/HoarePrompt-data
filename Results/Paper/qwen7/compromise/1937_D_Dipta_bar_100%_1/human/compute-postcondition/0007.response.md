Output State: **`idx_B` is an empty list, `s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list containing integers calculated based on positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` is a list of indices where '>' appears in `s`.**

The code `idx_B = []` initializes `idx_B` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `s`, `A`, or `idx_A`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
