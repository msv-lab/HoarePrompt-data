#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100. a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        b = list(map(int, a.split()))
        
        o = input().split()
        
        n = b[0]
        
        f = b[1]
        
        k = b[2]
        
        if k == n:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        fav = o[f - 1]
        
        dic = {i: o.count(i) for i in o}
        
        o.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if o.index(fav) > k - 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        l = sorted(list(set(o)), reverse=True)
        
        for i in range(len(l)):
            if fav != l[i]:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k <= 0:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k < 0:
                    print('MAYBE')
                    break
                else:
                    print('YES')
                    break
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` is equal to the length of the list `l`. The variable `k` is updated based on the conditions within the loop. If `k` is greater than 0 after all iterations, the final output will be 'YES'. If `k` becomes 0, the output will be 'MAYBE'. If `k` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the output will be 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a`, and three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`. For each test case, it checks if a specific element in the list can be moved up to `k` positions while maintaining a certain order condition. Based on the outcome, it prints either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results directly.
