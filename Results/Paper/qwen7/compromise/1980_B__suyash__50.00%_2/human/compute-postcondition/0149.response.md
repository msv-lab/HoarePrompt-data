Output State: **`a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` by spaces and converting each part to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split(), `n` is the first element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `b` to the variable `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The first element of `b` is an integer because `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the string `a` by spaces and converting each part to an integer.
