Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string from the user, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in `a.split()` to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split(), `n` is the first element of the list `b`, `f` is the second element of the list `b`, `k` is the third element of the list `b`.**

The code assigns the third element of the list `b` to the variable `k`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, and `f` remain unchanged.
