Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of the list `l`, `k` is in its final state, `fav`, `l`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `dic`, and `l` are in their final states after the loop has executed, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element of `a.split()` to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, a.split()))` takes the input string `a`, splits it into a list of strings using the `split()` method, and then converts each string in the list to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `b`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `k`, `fav`, `l`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `dic`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their final states after the loop.
