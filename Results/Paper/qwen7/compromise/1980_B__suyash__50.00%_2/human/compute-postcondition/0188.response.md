Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= dic[l[i]]` decrements the value of `k` by the value of `dic[l[i]]`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in the previous step, `i` now points to the next element in the list `l`. The length of the list `l` remains the same, and the value of `dic` also remains unchanged.
