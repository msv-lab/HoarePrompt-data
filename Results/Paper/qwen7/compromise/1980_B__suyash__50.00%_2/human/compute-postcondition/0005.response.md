Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string from the user, `b` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element in `a.split()` to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split(), `n` is the first element of the list `b`.**
