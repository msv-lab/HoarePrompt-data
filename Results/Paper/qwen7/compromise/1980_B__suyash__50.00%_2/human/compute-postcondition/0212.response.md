Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final state of `k` determines the output. If `k` is greater than 0 after all iterations, the output is 'YES'. If `k` becomes 0 exactly when the loop ends, the output is 'MAYBE'. If `k` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the output is 'NO'.

This means that after executing the loop as many times as specified by `t`, the final value of `k` will dictate whether the output is 'YES', 'MAYBE', or 'NO'.
