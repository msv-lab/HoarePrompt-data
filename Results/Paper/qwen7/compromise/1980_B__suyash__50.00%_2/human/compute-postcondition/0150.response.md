Output State: **`a` is an input string, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` by spaces and converting each part to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained from input().split(), `n` is the first element of list `b`, `f` is the second element of list `b`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the second element of list `b` to variable `f`. The values of `a`, `b`, `o`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
