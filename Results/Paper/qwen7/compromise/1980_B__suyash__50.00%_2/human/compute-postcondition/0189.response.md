Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[i]]`.

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'MAYBE'`. There is no need to determine the exact values of `i`, `k`, or `dic[l[i]]` because the print statement does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **MAYBE**
