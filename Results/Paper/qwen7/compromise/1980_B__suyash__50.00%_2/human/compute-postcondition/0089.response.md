Postcondition: **`dic` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `o` and its value is the count of that element in `o`; `i` is equal to the length of the list `l`; `k` is equal to `b[2]`; `fav` is equal to `o[f - 1]`; `l`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `dic`, and `l` are in their final states after the loop has executed; `a` is the input string from the user; `b` is a list containing the first element of the list `o`; `f` is equal to `b[1]`; `o` is sorted in descending order. If `o.index(fav) > k - 1`, the index of `fav` in `o` is greater than `k - 1`. Otherwise, no additional information about the values of `o`, `k`, or `fav` is provided.**
