Postcondition: **`i` is equal to the length of the list `l`, `k` is equal to `b[2]`, `fav`, `l`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `dic`, and `l` are in their final states after the loop has executed, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is a list containing the first element of the list `o`, `f` is equal to `b[1]`, and if `k == n`, the loop continues to the next iteration.**
