Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than `x // 2`. In such cases, the program may not find the correct maximum balance. For example, consider the test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  7 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program might output a value other than 1 because it does not correctly handle the scenario where the optimal balance is 1 when `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than `x // 2`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly handles cases where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than `x // 2`, ensuring the maximum balance is 1.
