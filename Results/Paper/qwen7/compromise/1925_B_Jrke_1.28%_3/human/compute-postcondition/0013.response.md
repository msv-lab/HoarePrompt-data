Output State: **`x` is an integer, and there exists an integer `i` such that `x` is divisible by `i` and `i` is less than or equal to `k`; `l` is a list containing two elements: 'ans' and `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains one element 'ans'. After appending `i`, `l` will contain two elements: 'ans' and `i`. The conditions regarding `x` and `i` remain unchanged.
