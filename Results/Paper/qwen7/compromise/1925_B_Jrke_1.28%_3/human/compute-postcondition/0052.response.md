The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables directly. The values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer obtained from the first input, `n` is an integer obtained from the second input, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains all such divisors, and the input to `range()` must be a positive integer greater than 0.**
