Output State: **`l` is a list containing `ans`, and `i` is the previous value of `i` + 2; `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = max(l)` assigns the maximum value from the list `l` to the variable `ans`. The list `l` contains `ans` and possibly the result of `x // i` if the condition `x // i <= k` was met. The value of `i` is updated to the previous value of `i` plus 2. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
