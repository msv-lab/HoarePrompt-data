Output State: **`x` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and any integer `i` such that `x` is divisible by `i`, and `l` is a list containing `[ans, i]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains `[ans]`. After appending `i`, `l` becomes `[ans, i]`. The values of `x` and `ans` remain unchanged.
