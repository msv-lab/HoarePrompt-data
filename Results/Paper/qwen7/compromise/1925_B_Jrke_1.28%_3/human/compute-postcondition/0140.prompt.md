Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is `x // n`, `l` contains the maximum divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, and `ans` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1 or 2, `x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `l` is a list containing three elements which are `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. If `x % i == 0` and `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the current value of `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in list `l`. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `l` is a list where the second element is 3 and the third element is the maximum of the second element (3), and `ans` is 3, if `x % 3 == 0`. Otherwise, `i` remains 3, `l` remains unchanged, and `ans` remains 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 5, `l` is a list where the second element is 3 and the third element is the maximum of the second element (3), and `ans` is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i` (which is 5), then `l` is updated to [3, 5, 0, 0] and `ans` is set to 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
