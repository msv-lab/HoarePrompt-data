Output State: **`ans` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `x // n`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `1` to the variable `ans`. The values of `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The output state includes the updated value of `ans` and retains the initial states of `x`, `n`, and `k`.
