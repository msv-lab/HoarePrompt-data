Postcondition: `i` is 5, `l` is a list containing elements [3, 5, 0], `ans` is 3. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then the condition is true and the if part is executed, leaving `l` as [3, 5, 0] and `ans` as 3. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the if condition's outcome.
