Output State: **`i` is 5, `l` is a list containing elements [3, 5], `ans` is 3**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 5) to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains only the element 3. After appending 5 to `l`, `l` becomes `[3, 5]`. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged.
