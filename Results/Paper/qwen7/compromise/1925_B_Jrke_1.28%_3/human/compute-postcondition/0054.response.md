Postcondition: **`x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains all such divisors, and the input to `range()` must be a positive integer greater than 0. If `k == 1`, then `ans` is 1 and `l` is a list containing 1. Otherwise, the values of `ans` and `l` remain unchanged.**
