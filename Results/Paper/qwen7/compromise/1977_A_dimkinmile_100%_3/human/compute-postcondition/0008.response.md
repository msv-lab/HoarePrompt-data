Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes two positive integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (t being a positive integer). It does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

However, based on typical problem structures, it seems the function might be expected to perform some operation with n, m, and t. Since the exact operation isn't specified, we can only describe the parameters and their constraints.
