Reasoning:
The annotated program describes a function `func_1()` that correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program splits the input into `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It then checks if `(n - m)` is non-negative and even using the condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

3. **Postconditions**:
   - The postconditions mentioned in the annotation match the expected behavior of the function.
   - The function correctly handles all the constraints specified in the problem statement.

Given that the logic implemented in `func_1()` accurately reflects the requirements of the problem and the annotations correctly describe the behavior of the function, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
