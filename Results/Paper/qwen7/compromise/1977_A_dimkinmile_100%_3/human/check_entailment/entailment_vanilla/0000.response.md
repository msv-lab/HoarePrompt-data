Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop that runs `kreker` times.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not implemented. This is problematic because the function is called inside the for loop without any implementation.

3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - It checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. If both conditions are true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

Now, let's evaluate the correctness of the logic:

- The logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves is correct. The key points are:
  - Each move either adds 1 cube or removes 1 cube.
  - Therefore, the difference between the final number of cubes and the initial number of cubes (`n - m`) must be even (since every addition and removal cancels out in pairs).
  - Additionally, `n - m` must be non-negative (since you cannot have a negative number of moves).

Given this analysis, the logic in `func_1()` is correct. However, the program fails because it calls `func_1()` without defining its body.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we need to define the function `func_1()` properly:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    def func_1():
        if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
    func_1()
```

### Conclusion:
Since the logic in `func_1()` is correct but the function needs to be defined before being called, the original program is **incorrect** due to the missing function definition.

Correctness: **False**
