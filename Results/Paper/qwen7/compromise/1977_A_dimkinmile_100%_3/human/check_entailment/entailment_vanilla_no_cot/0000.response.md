Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. **Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called without passing any arguments inside the loop.
2. **Logic for Determining Possibility**: The logic in `func_1()` checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. This condition is not sufficient to determine whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. 

To correctly solve the problem, the logic should check if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` because every move either adds or removes exactly one cube. Therefore, the total number of cubes `m` must be less than or equal to the total number of moves `n`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version directly compares `n` and `m` and prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and 'No' otherwise.
