Output State: `total` is 45, `numbers` is a list of `t` integers (unchanged), `values` is a list of 11 integers `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 45]`, `sum_values` is a list of 11 integers `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 90]`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the `numbers` list. However, since the loop does not modify any of the lists (`values` or `sum_values`) and only prints the `sum_values[n]` for each `n` in `numbers`, the contents of `values` and `sum_values` remain unchanged. The loop simply prints the existing values in `sum_values` corresponding to each element in `numbers`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
