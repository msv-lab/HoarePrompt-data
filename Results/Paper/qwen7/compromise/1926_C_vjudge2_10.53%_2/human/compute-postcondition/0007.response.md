Output State: **`total` is 0, `numbers` is a list of `t` integers where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `values` is a list of `max(numbers) + 1` zeros, `sum_values` is a list of `max(numbers) + 1` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `total` to 0. This does not affect the lists `numbers`, `values`, and `sum_values`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
