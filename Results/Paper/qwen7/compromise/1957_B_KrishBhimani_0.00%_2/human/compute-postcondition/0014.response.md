Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is half of its original value (k0 >> 1) and k0 must be at least 2, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0 and 1, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is initially 1) to the list `arr`. After appending, `arr` contains the integers 0 and 1. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
