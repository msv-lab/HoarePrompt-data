Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is the second integer from `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5**.

Explanation: The code `k0 = k` simply assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. Since the value of `k` is the second integer from `l1`, `k0` now holds the same value as `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
