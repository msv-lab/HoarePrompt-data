Output State: **`i` is 16, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191], `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ans` and does not perform any operations on the existing variables. Since the loop condition is based on `k` being non-zero, and `k` was reduced to 0 after 14 iterations, the loop terminates. Therefore, `i` remains 16, `k` becomes 0, and all other variables retain their previous values.
