Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is half of its original value (k0 >> 1), `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integer 0, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 0. After executing the code, `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
