Output State: **`i` is 0 (or 1, 3, or 4), `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is equal to 4, `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4], `ans` is a list containing the integer 4, `c` is 0, and the current value of `c` is equal to `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` is an empty list, so `sum(ans)` is 0. Given that `k0` is 4, `k0 - sum(ans)` evaluates to 4. Thus, `ans` now contains the integer 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
