Output State: **`k` is an odd integer, arr is a list containing the integer `i`.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `k` was initially an odd integer and no changes were made to its value, `k` remains an odd integer. The list `arr` now contains the integer `i` as its first (and only) element.
