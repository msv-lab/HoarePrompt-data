Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `arr` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string
   - `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`
   - `k` is 1
   - `k0` is equal to 4
   - `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4]
   - `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2]
   - `c` is 2

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be the next element in `arr` after 1. The next element in `arr` is 3.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: The loop will continue if `i` is still within the bounds of `arr`. Since `i` is now 3 and `arr` contains [0, 1, 3, 4], the loop can still execute.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`. The other variables (`t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `arr`, `ans`, `c`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is equal to 4, `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4], `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2], `c` is 2**
