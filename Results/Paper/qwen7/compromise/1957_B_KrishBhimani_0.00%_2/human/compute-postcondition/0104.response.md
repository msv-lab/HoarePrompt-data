Output State: `i` is 7, `c` is 13, `ans` is a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1, 1, k0 - 3, 2, k0 - 7, 8, k0 - 15, 16, k0 - 31, 32, k0 - 63, 64, k0 - 127, 128]`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each value in the list `arr` which contains the integers [0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191]. The loop will execute 14 times since there are 14 elements in `arr`. After each iteration, `i` takes on the next value from `arr`, `c` increments by 1, and `1 << i` is appended to `ans`. The loop does not break because `c` never equals `n-1` (which would be 13 in this case) during the iterations. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be the last value in `arr`, which is 7, `c` will be 14 (13 + 1), and `ans` will contain the sequence described above.
