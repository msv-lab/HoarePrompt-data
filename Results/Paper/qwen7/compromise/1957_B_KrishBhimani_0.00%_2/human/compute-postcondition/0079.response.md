Output State: `i` is 16, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split, `n` is the first integer from `l1`, `k` is equal to the original value of `k0` right-shifted by the number of iterations (which is 14), `k0` is equal to the original value of `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191, `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5.

This output state is calculated based on the fact that the loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero. Given that `k` starts as a positive integer up to \(10^4\) and is halved each iteration, it will take 14 iterations to reduce `k` to 0. During these iterations, the variable `i` increments by 1 each time, reaching 16 after 14 iterations. The list `arr` collects the values of `i` where `k & 1 == 1`, which corresponds to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of `k`. After 14 iterations, `k` becomes 0, ending the loop.
