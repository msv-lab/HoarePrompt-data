Output State: **`k` must be non-zero, `arr` contains the integers `i`, `i+1`, and `i+1`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains `i` and `i+1`. After appending `i`, `arr` now contains `i`, `i+1`, and `i` again (since `i` is increased by 1 before the append operation). The value of `k` remains non-zero, and `i` is increased by 1.
