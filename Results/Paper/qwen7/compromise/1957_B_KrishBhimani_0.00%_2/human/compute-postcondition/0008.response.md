Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is non-zero and its current value is odd, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is a list containing the integer 0, `i` is 0**.

The code appends the value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged.
