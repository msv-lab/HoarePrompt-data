Output State: **`i` is 2, `c` is the previous value of `c` + 2, `ans` is a list with elements `[1, k0 - 1, 1, k0 - 3, 2]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1 << i` (which is `1` left-shifted by `i` positions) to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `1 << i` equals `2`. Therefore, `2` is appended to the list `ans`, which previously contained `[1, k0 - 1, 1, k0 - 3]`. The values of `i` and `c` are updated according to their respective definitions, and the list `ans` is updated with the new element.
