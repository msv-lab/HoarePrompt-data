Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input split, `n` is 4, `k` is 1, `k0` is equal to 4, `arr` is a list containing the integers [0, 1, 3, 4], `ans` is a list containing the integers [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 16], `c` is 5, `l1` is updated to a list of strings from the input split.**

The code `l1 = input().split()` takes the input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
