Output State: **`k` is 0, `arr` contains [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `i` must be one of the elements in `arr`, `c` is 0, `ans` contains [-k0]**

Explanation: The code appends `-k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Since `k0` is not defined and there are no previous values given for `ans`, we assume `k0` is `k` (which is 0) and `sum(ans)` is initially 0 (as `ans` is empty). Therefore, the first element appended to `ans` is `-0 - 0 = 0`. The values of `k`, `arr`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged.
