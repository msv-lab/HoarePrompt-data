Output State: `k` is 0, `arr` contains the integers from 0 to 15 (inclusive), and `i` is 16.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is non-zero. Each iteration of the loop performs a bitwise right shift on `k`, effectively dividing it by 2, and appends the current value of `i` to `arr`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Given that `k0` was initially set to `k` and the loop runs until `k` becomes 0, the loop will run exactly `log2(k0)` times, which in this case is 4 times since `k0` is 14 (which has 4 bits). Therefore, `arr` will contain the integers from 0 to 15, and `i` will be 16 after the loop completes.
