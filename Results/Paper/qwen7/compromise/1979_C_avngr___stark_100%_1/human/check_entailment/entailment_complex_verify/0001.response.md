### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect because it misinterprets the problem and the solution approach. Let's break down the problem and the given solution step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, we receive \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) coins.
   - We need to find a distribution of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - `func_2(numbers)` computes the LCM of a list of numbers using `func_1`.

3. **Key Insight:**
   - The problem requires us to find a distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome.
   - A simple approach would be to set each \(x_i\) to a value that satisfies the inequality \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\).

4. **Implementation Check:**
   - The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are used to compute the LCM, which is not directly relevant to solving the problem as described.
   - The logic in the main part of the program should compute the LCM of the multipliers \(k_i\) and then distribute the coins accordingly.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The given solution uses `func_2` to compute the LCM of the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - After computing the LCM, the program divides the LCM by each \(k_i\) to get the corresponding bet \(x_i\).
   - The sum of these bets is compared with the LCM, and if the sum is less than the LCM, the bets are printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed.

6. **Detailed Analysis of the Given Solution:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers \(k_i\) ensures that the total bet is a common multiple of all \(k_i\).
   - Dividing the LCM by each \(k_i\) gives a bet \(x_i\) such that \(x_i < k_i \times x_i\).
   - Summing these bets ensures that the total bet is less than the LCM, which is strictly less than \(k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem by using the LCM to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program is incorrect because it did not use a simple approach of setting each \(x_i\) to 1. However, the given solution is correct and meets the problem requirements.

**Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
