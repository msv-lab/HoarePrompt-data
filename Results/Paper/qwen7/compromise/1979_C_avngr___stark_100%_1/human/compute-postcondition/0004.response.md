Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(result, num)`, and `num` is the third element of `numbers`.**

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(result, num)` updates the value of `result` by calling the function `func_1` with `result` and `num` as arguments. Since `num` is the third element of the list `numbers`, its value remains unchanged. The function call returns a new value for `result`, which is then assigned back to `result`. The list `numbers` and the fact that `num` is its third element remain unchanged.
