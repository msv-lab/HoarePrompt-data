#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 2 <= a, b <= 20.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of a and b divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd), where a and b are integers between 2 and 20 inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both within the range of 2 to 20 inclusive. It calculates the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd) and returns this value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where each integer represents the multiplier \(k_i\) for the i-th outcome, and the length of the list is \(n\) (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), with each \(k_i\) satisfying 2 ≤ \(k_i\) ≤ 20.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: Output State: The `result` variable will be the value returned by `func_1(func_1(func_1(initial_result, numbers[1]), numbers[2]), numbers[3])`, assuming `numbers` has at least 4 elements. In this final state, `numbers` is a list of integers with a length equal to or greater than 4, and `result` is the cumulative result of applying the `func_1` function successively to the initial `result` and each subsequent element in the `numbers` list.
    return result
    #The program returns the result of applying the `func_1` function three times successively to the initial `result` and the first four elements of the `numbers` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers named `numbers`, where each integer represents a multiplier \(k_i\). It returns the result of applying the `func_1` function three times successively to the initial `result` (which is set to the first element of `numbers`) and the next three elements of the list. If `numbers` has fewer than four elements, the function still returns the cumulative result of applying `func_1` up to the available elements.
