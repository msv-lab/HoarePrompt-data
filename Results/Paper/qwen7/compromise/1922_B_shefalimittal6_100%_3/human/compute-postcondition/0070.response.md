Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`.
   - The only variable directly involved in the loop condition is `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

3. **Analyze the Given States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `v[x]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `n` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure it meets the condition for the next iteration.
   - `idx` and `v[x]` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop condition.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - To allow the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `idx` and `v[x]` retain their values from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `idx` is increased by 1; `v[x]` is incremented by 1.**
