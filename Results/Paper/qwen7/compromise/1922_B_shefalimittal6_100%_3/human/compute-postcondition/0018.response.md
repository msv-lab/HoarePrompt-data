Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(n)` function. This means the loop variable is `_` (a placeholder), and the loop will iterate `n` times. The key variables here are `n` and `_`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` was greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - Since `_` is a placeholder, it does not affect the loop continuation condition.
   - `idx` is increased by 1, but it is not part of the loop head.
   - `v[x]` is increased by 1, but it is not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
