Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable mentioned here is `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: According to the provided information, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`.

3. **Check the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since the problem already states that `t` must be greater than 0, and there is no direct dependency on `t` in this loop, we focus on `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other relevant states**: The other variables (`data`, `t`, `idx`, `results`, and `v`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution based on the given code snippet.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
