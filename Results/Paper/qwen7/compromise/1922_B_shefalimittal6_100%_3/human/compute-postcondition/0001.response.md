Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input using `sys.stdin.read` (which is stored in the variable `input`) and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The original values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
