Output State: `idx` is increased by `n`; `v[x]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `x` is assigned the value of `data[idx-1]` and `n` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations (`n` in the final iteration).

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `idx` will be equal to the initial value of `idx` plus `n`, meaning it will have moved through the data list `n` times. The list `v` will have been updated such that each index up to `n` (inclusive) reflects how many times the corresponding value from the data list was encountered. The variable `n` will still hold its original value, which must have been at least as large as the actual number of iterations performed.
