Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1 if it was greater than 0; `n` is an integer from `data[idx]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[idx])` assigns the value of `data[idx]` (converted to an integer) to `n`. The other variables (`ans`, `cnt`, `idx`, `i`, and `results`) remain unchanged. Additionally, if `t` was greater than 0 before this line of code, it is decremented by 1.
