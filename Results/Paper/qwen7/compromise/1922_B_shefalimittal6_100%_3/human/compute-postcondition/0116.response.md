Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n)`. The key variables here are `n` and `_`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `idx` is increased by 1 (though `idx` is not part of the loop head).
   - `v[x]` is incremented by 1 (though `v[x]` is not part of the loop head).

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since the loop depends on `n` being greater than 0, we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.
   - The variable `idx` and `v[x]` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
