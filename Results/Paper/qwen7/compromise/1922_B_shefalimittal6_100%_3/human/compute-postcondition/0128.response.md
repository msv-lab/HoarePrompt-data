Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable that will take values from `0` to `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` will start at `0` because the `range(n + 1)` function generates values from `0` to `n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

3. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` will start at `0`, we need to ensure that `i` is `0` at the beginning of the loop.
   - The value of `n` should remain as it is since it is not modified within the loop head.
   - The other variables (`cnt`, `idx`, `v`, `t`, and `results`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution condition.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be `0`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` remains unchanged**.
