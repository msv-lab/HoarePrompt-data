Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`**.

This means that the value of `n` is now the integer version of the third element (index 2) in the list `data`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
