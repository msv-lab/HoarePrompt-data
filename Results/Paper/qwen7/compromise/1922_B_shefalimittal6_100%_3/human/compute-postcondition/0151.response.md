Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `ans` is increased by `v[4] * (v[4] - 1) * (v[4] - 2) // 6`, `v[i]` is `v[4]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to it, where `i` is 4. Since `v[i]` (which is `v[4]`) is not checked for being greater than or equal to 2, the condition specified in the postcondition does not apply here. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was only mentioned in the postcondition but not used in the code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `ans` value and retains the original conditions for `i` and `n`.
