Output State: **`ans` is 0, `idx` is 3 + n, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. The values of `idx` and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states because they are not affected by this assignment. The initial conditions that `n` must be greater than 0 and that each element `v[x]` in the list `v` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` as it was updated in each iteration of the loop also remain valid.
