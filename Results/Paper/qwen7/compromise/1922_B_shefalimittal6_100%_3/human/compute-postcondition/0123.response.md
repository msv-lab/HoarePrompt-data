Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1; `v[x]` is incremented by 1**

The code `v[x] += 1` increments the value of `v[x]` by 1. However, the initial values or expressions for `v`, `x`, and the updated value of `v[x]` are not provided. Therefore, we only know that `v[x]` has been incremented by 1. The conditions and changes for `n` and `idx` remain as stated in the initial state.
