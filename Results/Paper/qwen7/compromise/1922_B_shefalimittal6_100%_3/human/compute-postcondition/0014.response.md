Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `n`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `idx` is increased by 1.
   - `v[x]` is increased by 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue, and it was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be greater than 0 for the next iteration unless explicitly changed.
   - `idx` and `v[x]` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `n`, and it must remain greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
