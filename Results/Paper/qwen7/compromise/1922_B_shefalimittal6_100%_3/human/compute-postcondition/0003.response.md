Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `idx` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of the first element in the list `data` (which is at index `idx`) to the variable `t`. Since `idx` is initially 0, `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]`. After this assignment, `idx` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
