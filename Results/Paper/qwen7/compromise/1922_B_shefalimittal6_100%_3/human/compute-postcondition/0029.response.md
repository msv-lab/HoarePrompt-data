Output State: **`ans` is `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2`, `idx` is 3 + n, `cnt` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, and the current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The line `ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to its current value. Given the initial conditions, `cnt` is 0, so `ans` remains 0. The values of `idx`, `cnt`, `n`, `i`, and `v[i]` remain unchanged.
