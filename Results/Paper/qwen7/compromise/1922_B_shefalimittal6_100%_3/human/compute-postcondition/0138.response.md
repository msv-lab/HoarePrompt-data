Output State: **`i` is 2, `cnt` is the sum of `v[1]` and `v[0]`, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += v[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by `v[i]`. Given that `i` was initially 1 and the postcondition specifies that `i` remains 1 after the code execution, `i` becomes 2 after this line of code. The value of `cnt` is updated to be the sum of `v[1]` and `v[0]`. The value of `ans` does not change because no operation directly modifies `ans` in this line of code.
