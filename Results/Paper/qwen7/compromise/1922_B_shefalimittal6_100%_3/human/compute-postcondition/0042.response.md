Output State: **`ans` is `cnt * v[0] * (v[0] - 1) // 2 + v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6 + cnt * v[3] * (v[3] - 1) // 2 + v[3] * (v[3] - 1) * (v[3] - 2) // 6`, `idx` is 3 + n, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, if `v[3]` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code adds `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to `ans`. Since `i` is 3, it adds `v[3] * (v[3] - 1) * (v[3] - 2) // 6` to `ans`. The other variables (`idx`, `cnt`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The condition for `v[3]` being greater than or equal to 2 remains the same.
