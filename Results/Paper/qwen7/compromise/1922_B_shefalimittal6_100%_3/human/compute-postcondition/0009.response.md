Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `v` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `v` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. Here, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
