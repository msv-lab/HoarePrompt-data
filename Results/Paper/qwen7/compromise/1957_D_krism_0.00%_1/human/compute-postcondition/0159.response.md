Output State: **`j` is 32, `c` remains as it was initially set, `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` reflect the count of 0s and 1s respectively up to that bit position, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` reflect the count of 0s and 1s from that bit position to the end of the integer `c`, and `y` is equal to `arr[i - 1]`.**

The code `y = arr[i - 1]` assigns the value of `arr[i - 1]` to the variable `y`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `arr[i - 1]`, we cannot specify the exact value of `y`. However, we know that `y` now holds the value of `arr[i - 1]`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
