Output State: **`prefix` is now `[0, v ^ 0, v ^ v, v ^ (v ^ v)]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (excluding the first element), `v` is the third element of `arr`**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the `prefix` list. This new value is calculated as `v ^ prefix[-1]`, where `prefix[-1]` refers to the last element of the `prefix` list, which is `v ^ v`. Therefore, the new element appended to `prefix` is `v ^ (v ^ v)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
