Output State: `i` is 31, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 31, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31, if `cur >> j & 1` was true for any iteration, `suf[j][1]` is the count of such occurrences, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is the count.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations (from `j=0` to `j=31`), the variable `j` will be 31. The `suf` matrix will contain counts for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, indicating how many times the corresponding bit in `cur` was 1 or 0 across all iterations of the loop.
