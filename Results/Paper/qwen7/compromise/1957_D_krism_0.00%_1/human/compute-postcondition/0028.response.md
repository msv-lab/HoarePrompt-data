Output State: **`i` is 31, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 0, `suf[0][1]` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 32, and the current value of `(cur >> j & 1)` is true**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, `suf[0][1]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
