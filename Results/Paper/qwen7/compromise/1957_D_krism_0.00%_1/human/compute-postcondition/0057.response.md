Postcondition: `i` is 30, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, and `j` is either 1 or 2. `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31:
- If `j` is 1, `suf[j][0]` is the count of occurrences where `prefix[30] >> j & 1` was false for all iterations, and `suf[0][0]` is incremented by 1.
- If `j` is 2, `suf[j][1]` is the count of such occurrences plus 1 if `prefix[30] >> j & 1` is true, otherwise `suf[j][0]` remains the same, and `cur >> j & 1` is false.
