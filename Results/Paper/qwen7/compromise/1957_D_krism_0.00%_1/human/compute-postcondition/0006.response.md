Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `v` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `arr` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `prefix` is a list containing `[0, v ^ 0]`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `arr` must have at least one element.
   - `v` is the first element of `arr`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `arr`, at the end of the previous iteration, `v` would be the current element being processed.
   - For the next iteration, `v` will be the next element in `arr`.
   - The list `arr` will be reduced by removing the first element (which was `v`).

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:
- `prefix` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `arr` is now a list without the first element (which was `v`).
- `v` is now the next element in `arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`prefix` is a list containing `[0, v ^ 0]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (excluding the first element), `v` is the second element of `arr`**
