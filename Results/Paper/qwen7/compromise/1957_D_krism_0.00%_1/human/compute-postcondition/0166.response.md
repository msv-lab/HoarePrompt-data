Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1, `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code decrements the second element of the list `suf[j]` by 1. The first element of `pre[j]` is increased by 1 as per the initial state. The values of `c` and `j` remain unchanged.
