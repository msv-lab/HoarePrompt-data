Output State: **`j` is 32; `c` is an integer where the bit at position 31 is 0 or `suf[31][1]` is decremented by 1, `pre[31][0]` is 1, and `pre[31][1]` is 0, and `suf[31][0]` is -1 and `suf[31][1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 32, `pre[32][0]` is updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
