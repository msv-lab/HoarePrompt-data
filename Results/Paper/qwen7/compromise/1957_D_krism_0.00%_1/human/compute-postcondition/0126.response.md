Output State: `i` is 2, `n` is 31, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `ans` + `pre[5][0] * suf[5][0] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 32, and both `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` are 0, while `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` are also 0.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j` = 0 to `j` = 31. For each iteration, the loop updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays based on the value of `c >> j & 1`. After 31 iterations, `j` becomes 32. Since the loop condition `j < 32` is no longer satisfied, the loop terminates. At this point, all bits of `c` have been processed, so `pre[32][0]` and `pre[32][1]` are both 0, and similarly, `suf[32][0]` and `suf[32][1]` are both 0.
