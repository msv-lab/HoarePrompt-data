State: **`i` is 31, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 32**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and goes up to 31 (inclusive). Therefore, before the loop starts, `j` must be 0.
- The loop condition is `range(32)`, which means the loop will run 32 times (from 0 to 31).
- The initial values of `i` and `n` are both 31, but the loop condition depends on the value of `n` being greater than or equal to 32 for the loop to execute. Since `n` is initially 31, it does not satisfy this condition, so `n` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 32.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
