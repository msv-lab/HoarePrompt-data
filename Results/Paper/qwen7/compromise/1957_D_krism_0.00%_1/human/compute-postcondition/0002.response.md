Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; arr is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int type, and stores them in a list named `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
