Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer t indicating the number of subsequent test cases, an integer n indicating the number of integers in the list, and a list of n integers. The function processes each test case individually and returns a result for each, adhering to the specified constraints.
