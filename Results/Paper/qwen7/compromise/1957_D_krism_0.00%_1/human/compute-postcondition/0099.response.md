Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 31, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `ans` + `pre[5][0] * suf[5][0] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` where `k` is 5. Since the exact values of `pre[5][0]`, `pre[5][1]`, `suf[5][0]`, and `suf[5][1]` are not provided, we express the updated value of `ans` in terms of these variables. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `y`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
