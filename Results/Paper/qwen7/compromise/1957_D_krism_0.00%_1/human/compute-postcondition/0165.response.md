Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of the j-th bit of `c` was 1, but this does not affect the value of `pre[j][1]`. The code increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. Therefore, the only change is that `pre[j][1]` has been increased by 1.
