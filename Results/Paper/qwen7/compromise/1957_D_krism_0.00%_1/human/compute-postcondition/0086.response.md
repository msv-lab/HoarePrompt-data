Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `suf` is a list where each element is a tuple `[int, int]` where each tuple's second element is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the second element of the tuple at index `j` in the list `suf` by 1. The first element of the tuple remains unchanged, and the values of `cur` and `j` (which was incremented previously) are not affected by this line of code.
