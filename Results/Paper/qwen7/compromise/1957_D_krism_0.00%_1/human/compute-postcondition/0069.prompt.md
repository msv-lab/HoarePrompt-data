Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 30; `n` is 31; `cur` is `prefix[30]`; `j` is 31; `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31, if `prefix[30] >> j & 1` was true for any iteration, `suf[j][1]` is the count of such occurrences, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is the count.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if cur >> j & 1:
        suf[j][1] += 1
    else:
        suf[j][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 30, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, and `j` is either 1 or 2. `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31:
- If `j` is 1, `suf[j][0]` is the count of occurrences where `prefix[30] >> j & 1` was false for all iterations, and `suf[0][0]` is incremented by 1.
- If `j` is 2, `suf[j][1]` is the count of such occurrences plus 1 if `prefix[30] >> j & 1` is true, otherwise `suf[j][0]` remains the same, and `cur >> j & 1` is false.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 30, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `j` is 0, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix. If the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, then `suf[0][1]` is 2. Otherwise, `suf[0][0]` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 30, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `j` is 1, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix. If the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, then `suf[1][1]` is 1. Otherwise, `suf[1][0]` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
