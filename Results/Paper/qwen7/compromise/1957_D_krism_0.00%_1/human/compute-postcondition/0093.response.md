Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is -1
- `n` is 31
- `cur` is `prefix[-1]`, but since `prefix` is not defined, and there is no other information about `prefix`, we cannot determine the value of `cur`.
- `j` is 32
- `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` is 32 and `suf[j][0]` is 32.

Given that `pre` is not defined in the initial state and there is no way to determine its value from the provided information, we cannot accurately determine what will be printed.

Output: **pre (where pre is undefined)**
