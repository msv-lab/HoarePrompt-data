Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in this case is `j`. The other variables mentioned in the postcondition (`cur` and `suf`) are not part of the loop head.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 32. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was an integer, and it was incremented by 1.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be set to its new value, which is `j + 1`.

Given that `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

**State:**
- `cur` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `j` is now `j + 1`.
- `suf` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the exact value of `j` was not provided in the initial state, we represent it symbolically as `j + 1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cur` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `suf` is a list where each element is a tuple `[int, int]`**
