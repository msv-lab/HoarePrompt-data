Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[-1]` (which is out of index), `j` is 32, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` is 32 and `suf[j][0]` is 32.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all 32 iterations, the variable `i` will have decremented below 0 and thus becomes -1. The variable `n` remains 31 as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `cur` would refer to `prefix[-1]`, but since this index is out of bounds, it is not meaningful. The `suf` matrix will have each entry set to `[32, 32]`, meaning that for every bit position `j` from 0 to 31, the bit was both 1 and 0 exactly 32 times across all iterations of the loop.
