Output State: **`i` is 30, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `j` is 1, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix, `suf[1][0]` is 1.**

The code `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the value at `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, the value at `suf[1][0]` is incremented by 1. Since `suf` is initially a 32x2 matrix and no other values are modified, the other elements remain unchanged.
