Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all keys initially point to an empty list.**

The code `nodes = defaultdict(list)` creates a new dictionary-like object where all keys initially map to an empty list. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `edges`, or `empty`.
