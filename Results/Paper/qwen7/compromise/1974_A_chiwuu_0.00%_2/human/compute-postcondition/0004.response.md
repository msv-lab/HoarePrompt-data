Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers t, x, and y, with t ranging from 1 to 10^4 and x, y ranging from 0 to 99. For each test case, the function returns information based on the values of x and y.**

However, since the specific return values or conditions based on x and y are not provided, the exact return value cannot be detailed. The function processes a series of test cases and returns different outputs for each based on the values of x and y within each test case.
