Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer after all iterations of the loop have executed.

In this output state, the value of `t` will be determined by the series of operations performed within the loop for each iteration from `i` in `range(n)`. The exact value of `t` will depend on the inputs provided for `a` and `b` in each iteration, but it will always be constrained between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The value of `n` will be the number of times the loop has iterated, which is specified as an input integer.
