The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( y \). For each test case, it calculates a value for \( t \) based on the given \( x \) and \( y \) values through a series of arithmetic operations. The final value of \( t \) is constrained between 1 and \( 10^4 \) inclusive and is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the calculated \( t \) for each test case.
