Output State: **`numbers` is an empty list, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.**

The code initializes an empty list named `numbers`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, or the list of starting nodes. Therefore, these variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
