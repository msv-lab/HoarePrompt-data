Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; the array a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6]; q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        *_, k = R()
        
        a = {*R()}
        
        b = {*R()}
        
        f = 1
        
        m = n = k // 2
        
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            u = i in a
            v = i in b
            f &= u | v
            m -= u & ~v
            n -= ~u & v
        
        print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
        
    #State: Output State: `f` is True if every integer `i` from 1 to `k` is found in either set `a` or set `b`, otherwise `f` is False. `i` is `k + 1`, `b` is a set containing all elements of the tuple returned by `R()`, `v` is a boolean indicating whether `i` is in `b`, `u` is a boolean indicating whether `i` is in `a`, `m` is `k // 2 - sum((u & ~v) for i in range(1, k + 1))`, `n` is `k // 2 - sum((~u & v) for i in range(1, k + 1))`.
    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, the final state of the variables can be described as follows:
    #- The variable `f` will be `True` if and only if every integer `i` from 1 to `k` is present in at least one of the sets `a` or `b`. Otherwise, `f` will be `False`.
    #- The variable `i` will be equal to `k + 1` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `k` and then exits.
    #- The set `b` will contain all elements of the tuple returned by `R()` after the loop has completed.
    #- The boolean `v` will indicate whether `i` (which is now `k + 1`) is in `b`, but since `i` exceeds the range of `b`, `v` will be `False`.
    #- The boolean `u` will indicate whether `i` (which is now `k + 1`) is in `a`, but since `i` exceeds the range of `a`, `u` will be `False`.
    #- The variable `m` will be calculated as `k // 2 - sum((u & ~v) for i in range(1, k + 1))`. Since `i` exceeds the range of both `a` and `b`, `u & ~v` will be `False` for all iterations, making `m` equal to `k // 2`.
    #- The variable `n` will be calculated as `k // 2 - sum((~u & v) for i in range(1, k + 1))`. Similarly, since `i` exceeds the range of both `a` and `b`, `~u & v` will be `False` for all iterations, making `n` equal to `k // 2`.
