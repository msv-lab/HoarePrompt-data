### Reasoning:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The function `func()` is designed to handle multiple test cases, but it incorrectly processes the input. Specifically, it expects the input to be structured in a way that doesn't align with the problem statement. The code reads `*_, k = R()` which implies that the last element of the input line should be `k`, but the problem statement suggests that `k` is the number of queries, and the input structure should be different.

2. **Set Initialization**: The code initializes `a` and `b` as sets using `{*R()}`. However, the problem requires handling ranges `[l, r]` for each query, not just a fixed set of numbers up to `k`.

3. **Logic Mismatch**: The logic inside the loop is checking if every integer from 1 to `k` is present in either set `a` or set `b`. This is not relevant to the problem requirements. The problem asks to find pairs of indices within the range `[l, r]` that have different elements.

4. **Output Format**: The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether every integer from 1 to `k` is found in either set `a` or set `b`, which is not aligned with the required output format. The correct output should provide pairs of indices `(i, j)` for each query where `a[i] != a[j]`, or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Given these issues, the provided code does not implement the correct solution for the problem.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: **False**
