Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The program attempts to check if every integer from 1 to k is present in at least one of two sets, `a` and `b`. However, the problem requires finding a pair of different elements within a specified subarray for each query, not checking the presence of integers in sets.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the input but does not correctly parse the queries. It reads three integers per query (which should be two integers `l` and `r`) and incorrectly uses them to form sets `a` and `b`.

2. **Set Construction**: The sets `a` and `b` are constructed using the second and third sets of integers read from the input, which do not correspond to the actual subarrays defined by the queries.

3. **Flag `f` Usage**: The flag `f` is used to check if every integer from 1 to k is present in at least one of the sets `a` and `b`. This is not relevant to the problem's requirements, which require finding a pair of different elements within the specified subarray.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints 'YNEOS' based on the value of `f`, which again does not match the required output format of printing pairs of indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Given these issues, the provided program does not solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
