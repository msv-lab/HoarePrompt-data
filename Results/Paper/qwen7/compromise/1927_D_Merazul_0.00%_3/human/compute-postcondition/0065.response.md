Output State: **`u` is a boolean value indicating whether `i` is in list `a`, `i` is a variable with its original value, and `a` is a list with its original values.**

Explanation: The code `u = i in a` checks if the variable `i` is present in the list `a`. It assigns the result (a boolean value) to the variable `u`. The values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
