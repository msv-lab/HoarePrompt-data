Output State: **`f` is False, `i` is 3, `k` is at least 3, `u` is False, `v` is False, `m` is 0, `n` is -1, `b` is not defined.**

Explanation: The expression `m -= u & ~v` updates `m` by subtracting the result of `u & ~v` from its current value. Given that `u` is `False` (which is equivalent to 0) and `v` is also `False` (which is equivalent to 0), `~v` evaluates to `-1` (since the bitwise NOT of 0 is -1). The bitwise AND of `u` (0) and `-1` is `0`. Therefore, `m` is updated to `1 - 0`, which results in `m` being `0`. All other variables remain unchanged.
