The loop condition is `while t:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` is `True`. Since no initial value or modification of `t` is provided, we cannot assume any specific value for `t`. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be `True`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is equal to `k`
- `u` is `False`
- `v` is `False`
- `f` is `False`
- `m` is `m - (k - 2)`
- `n` is `n - (k - 2)`

None of these variables directly affect the loop condition `t`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `t` itself.

State: **`t` must be `True`**
