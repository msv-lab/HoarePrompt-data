The function reads multiple integers `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 78) from the user, constructs a string `word` based on the value of `n`, and prints the resulting string. The function processes up to 100 test cases. After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of strings `word` generated according to specific rules based on the input values.
