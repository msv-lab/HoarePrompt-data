### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program takes an integer \( t \) as input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints \( y \).

3. **Key Consideration**:
   - The goal is to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
   - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \(\gcd(x, y)\) will be at most 1 because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers and thus coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1).
   - Therefore, \(\gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x\).

4. **Checking the Solution**:
   - The solution provided always sets \( y = x - 1 \).
   - This choice ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), making \(\gcd(x, y) + y = x\), which is indeed the maximum possible value since \(\gcd(x, y) \leq y < x\).

5. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 9 \) and \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 20 \) and \(\gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21\).
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 99 \) and \(\gcd(100, 99) + 99 = 1 + 99 = 100\).

However, let's consider another approach to verify if \( y = x - 1 \) is always the optimal choice:

- For \( x = 10 \):
  - \( y = 9 \) gives \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
  - But we should also check other potential values of \( y \):
    - \( y = 5 \) gives \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).
    - \( y = 2 \) gives \(\gcd(10, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4\).

From these examples, we see that \( y = 5 \) can give the same maximum value as \( y = 9 \). Therefore, setting \( y = x - 1 \) is not always the best choice.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumes that \( y = x - 1 \) is always the optimal choice without considering other potential values of \( y \) that might yield the same or higher \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
