Postcondition: `in_aa` and `out_aa` will take on new values from the `zip` function. `pairs_in_D` will be adjusted based on the conditions of `C[in_aa]` and `E[out_aa]`. Specifically, if `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and either `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 (if greater than 0) or `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 and `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. In both cases, `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1, and if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `out_aa` is decreased by 1.
