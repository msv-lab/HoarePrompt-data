Output State: **`D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input; `k` is an integer from the input; `aa` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string; `nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4; `bb` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in the list `bb`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`.**

Explanation: The code `E = cnt_aa - D` creates a new Counter object `E` which contains the elements that are in `cnt_aa` but not in `D`. The values of `D`, `cnt_aa`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `nabors`, `bb`, `cnt_bb`, and `pairs_in_D` remain unchanged from their initial states.
