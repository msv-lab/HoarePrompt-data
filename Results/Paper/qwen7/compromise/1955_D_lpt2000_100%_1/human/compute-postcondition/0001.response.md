State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `nabors`, which is used as the range parameter.
- For the loop to execute, `nabors` must be a positive integer because the `range()` function requires a non-negative integer as its argument.
- Additionally, since `nabors` is constrained by the condition \(1 \leq nabors \leq 10^4\), this constraint must be maintained.
- No other variables or states need to be adjusted as they are not involved in the loop head.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
