Output State: **`cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split by spaces; `aa` is a list of strings where each string is an element from the input split by spaces; `bb` is a list of strings from the new input split by spaces; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements of `bb`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new Counter object `cnt_bb` that counts the occurrences of elements in the list `bb`. The other variables (`cnt_aa`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
