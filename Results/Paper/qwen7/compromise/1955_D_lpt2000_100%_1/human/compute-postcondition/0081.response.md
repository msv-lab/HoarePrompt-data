Postcondition: **`D` is a Counter object, `E` is updated to be the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `m` is `m + 1`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` (sum of the values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k` else 0, `n` is the integer input, `in_aa` and `out_aa` are indices that must be within the bounds of `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` respectively, and both `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element, `aa` is a list of indices starting from index `m` to the end of the list, `bb` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `cnt_aa` is updated to be a Counter object of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object of the list `bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`. The current value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than or equal to 0 and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0**
