Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 2`, `fnd` is 0, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The initial state had `D[out_aa]` as `D[out_aa] - 1` and `fnd` as 0. The code `pairs_in_D -= 1` decreases the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. Since no other changes were made to `D[out_aa]` or `fnd`, these variables retain their initial values except for `pairs_in_D`, which is decreased by 1.
