Output State: **`E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

This means that the value of `C[in_aa]` has been decreased by 1, while the values of `E[out_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `pairs_in_D`, `C[out_aa]`, and `D[in_aa]` remain as they were before the operation, except for the change in `C[in_aa]`.
