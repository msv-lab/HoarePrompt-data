Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input; `k` is an integer from the input; `aa` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string; `nabors` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4; `bb` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in the list `bb`; `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` else `fnd` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `n` is an integer such that `n > m`; `m` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `aa` is a list of strings with length at least `n`; `nabors` is an integer such that `1 <= nabors <= 10^4`; `bb` is a list of strings; `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in the list `bb`; `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`; `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`; `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `m` is an integer and `m` is increased by 1; `k` is an integer; `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` (the sum of the values in `D` + 1 if `C[in_aa]` was positive, or just the sum of the values in `D` if `C[in_aa]` was not positive) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `out_aa`'s count in `D` is decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa] > 0` and `C[in_aa]` was positive, otherwise `out_aa`'s count in `E` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was positive; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was not positive; `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`; `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`; `m` is incremented by 1; `k` is an integer; `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D + 1` (if `C[in_aa]` was positive) or `pairs_in_D` (if `C[in_aa]` was not positive) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `out_aa`'s count in `D` is decreased by 1 if `D[out_aa] > 0` and `C[in_aa]` was positive, otherwise `out_aa`'s count in `E` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was positive; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was not positive; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa] > 0`; `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D + 1` (if `C[in_aa]` was positive) or `pairs_in_D` (if `C[in_aa]` was not positive) is greater than or equal to `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
