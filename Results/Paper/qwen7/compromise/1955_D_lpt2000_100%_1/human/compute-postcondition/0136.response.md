Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces; all other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. All other variables (`D`, `E`, `fnd`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `pairs_in_D`, `C`, and `nabors`) remain unchanged from their previous state.
