Postcondition: `E[out_aa]` is an integer, `D[out_aa]` is an integer, `pairs_in_D` is an integer, `C[out_aa]` is an integer. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.
