Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `2 * n + 1`, `ans_f` contains the last calculated `ans`, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, and `ans` is increased by the minimum value between the elements of `lst`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` has one element less and the first element at index 0 is removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is less than `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and if the length of `lst` is not 2, the second element of `lst` (index 1) is removed; otherwise, the value of `ans` is the original `ans` plus the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is less than `n * 2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`. If `lst` has more than 2 elements, the second element is removed, otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
