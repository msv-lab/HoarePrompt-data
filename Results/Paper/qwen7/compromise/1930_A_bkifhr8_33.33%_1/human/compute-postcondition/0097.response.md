Output State: **`i` is less than `n * 2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `lst` has at most 1 element, the first element of `lst` (if exists) is no longer the first element, `lst` now has no elements.**

Explanation: The code removes the second element from the list `lst`. Given that `lst` has at most one element initially, removing the second element means `lst` will now have no elements. All other conditions remain unchanged.
