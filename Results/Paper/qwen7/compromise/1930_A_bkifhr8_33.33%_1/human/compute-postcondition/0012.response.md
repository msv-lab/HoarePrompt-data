Output State: **`ans` is the minimum value between `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[1])` minus one, `i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer, and the length of `lst` is now length of `lst` minus one.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `1 * 2` (which is index 2) from the list `lst`. Since `lst` initially had a length that was not equal to 2, removing the element at index 2 reduces the length of `lst` by one. The value of `ans` remains the same as it was the minimum value between `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[1])`, which simplifies to just `int(lst[1])`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
