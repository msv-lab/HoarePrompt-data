Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is the sum of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` has had its second element removed at index 1.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index 1 from the list `lst`. Initially, `lst` had its first element removed, so now the second element (index 1) is being removed. The values of `i`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
