Output State: **`ans_f` contains the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs from the list `lst`, and `i` is equal to `n * 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. Since `ans` contains the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from the list `lst`, and `i` indicates that all iterations of the loop have been completed (i.e., `i` is equal to `n * 2`), the output state includes these updated values. The length of `lst` and its pairing status remain unchanged, and the value of `i` reflects the completion of the loop.
