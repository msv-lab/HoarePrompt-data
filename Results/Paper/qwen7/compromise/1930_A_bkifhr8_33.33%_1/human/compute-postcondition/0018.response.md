Postcondition: `ans` is either the minimum value between `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[1]) - 1`, or `0 + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, depending on whether the length of `lst` is not 2. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `i` remains 0 and `n` remains a positive integer. If the length of `lst` is 2, `i` remains 0 and `n` remains a positive integer, with `ans` being updated accordingly.
