Postcondition: `i` is less than or equal to `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` has one element less and the first element at index 0 is removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
