Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `t` used in the `range(t)` function.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 before entering the loop.
   - `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive).

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < t`. Therefore, the loop will run `t` times if `t` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, we need to ensure `t` is at least 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is at least 1.

**State:**
**`t` must be at least 1, ans_f is an empty list**
