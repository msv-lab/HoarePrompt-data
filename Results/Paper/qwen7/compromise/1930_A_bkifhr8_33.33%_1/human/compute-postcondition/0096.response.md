Output State: **`i` is less than `n * 2 - 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, `lst` has at most 1 element, the first element of `lst` (if exists) is no longer the first element.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which is the same as index `0`. After removing the first element from `lst`, `lst` now has at most 1 element left. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.
