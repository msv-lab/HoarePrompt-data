Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t)`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is `2 * n`
   - `ans_f` contains the last calculated `ans`
   - `ans` contains the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from the list `lst` until the list cannot be split into pairs or the loop has completed its iterations.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `2 * n` and the loop continues as long as `i < t`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `i`).
   - Therefore, `i` will be `2 * n + 1`.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` changes to `2 * n + 1`.
   - `ans_f` and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `ans_f` contains the last calculated `ans`, and `ans` contains the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from the list `lst` until the list cannot be split into pairs or the loop has completed its iterations.**
