Output State: **The final value of `ans` is the sum of all minimum values between pairs of elements taken from the list `lst`, until the list `lst` has less than 2 elements left or the loop completes all iterations.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will reach `n * 2`. The loop will keep removing elements from `lst` in pairs, updating `ans` with the minimum value of each pair, until `lst` has fewer than 2 elements remaining or the loop reaches its maximum iterations defined by `n * 2`. At the end, `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of these minimum values.
