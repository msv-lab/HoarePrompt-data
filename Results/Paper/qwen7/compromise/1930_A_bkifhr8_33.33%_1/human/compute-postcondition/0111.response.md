Output State: **`ans_f` must contain at least three elements, and `i` is equal to the last element in `ans_f`.**

Explanation: Given that the loop runs for exactly 3 iterations based on the provided information, `ans_f` must have at least three elements for the loop to complete its full execution. After 3 iterations, the variable `i` will take on the value of the last element added to `ans_f`, which is the third element since the loop iterates three times.
