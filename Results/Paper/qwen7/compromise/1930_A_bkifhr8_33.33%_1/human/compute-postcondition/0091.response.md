Output State: **`i` is less than `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and the value of `ans` is the original `ans` plus the minimum value between `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly mentioned, we assume it is part of an implicit loop or conditional structure. The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `ans`, or `lst`. It only indicates that the execution will exit the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the `break` statement is noted as having been executed.
