Output State: **`ans` is 0, `ans_f` contains the last computed value of `ans`, `ans` is the sum of all minimum values between pairs of elements taken from the list `lst`, until the list `lst` has less than 2 elements left or the loop completes all iterations, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `t` remains the same**.

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. All other variables (`ans_f`, `lst`, `i`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
