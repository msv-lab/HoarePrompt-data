Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n * 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `2 * n + 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`. 

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at `2 * n + 1`, it is already greater than `n * 2` (because `2 * n + 1 > n * 2` when `n > 0`). Therefore, the loop will not execute based on the given initial value of `i`.
   - To make the loop execute, `i` must be less than `n * 2` at the start of the loop. This means `i` should be adjusted to be less than or equal to `n * 2`.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `ans_f`, `ans`, `l`, and `lst` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop executes. They can remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be less than or equal to `n * 2`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` must be less than or equal to `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer**
