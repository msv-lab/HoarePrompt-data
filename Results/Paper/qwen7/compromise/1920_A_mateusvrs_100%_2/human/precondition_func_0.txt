t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, each test case contains an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each constraint, a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
