You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

If `bx` is greater than `ax`, then `r` is [0]. Otherwise, `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
    #- `t` is set to 0 since the initial value of `t` has been exhausted.
    #- `r` will contain either 0 or the calculated value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` based on the conditions inside the loop.
    #- `n` will be the total number of iterations that were executed.
    #- `cx` will contain all unique `x` values for which `a` was not 1.
    #- `ax` will be the smallest `x` value for which `a` was 2.
    #- `bx` will be the largest `x` value for which `a` was 1.
    #- `r` will be 0 if `bx` is greater than `ax`; otherwise, it will be `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` counts how many elements in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

    #This is printed: 0 or ax - bx + 1 - tmp (where ax is the minimum value of x where a was 2, bx is the maximum value of x where a was 1, and tmp is the count of elements in cx that are within the range [bx, ax])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a series of constraints involving integers `a` and `x`. For each constraint, it updates variables `ax` and `bx` based on the value of `a`. After processing all constraints for each test case, it calculates a result stored in a list `r` based on the values of `ax`, `bx`, and a set `cx`. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A set `cx` is used to store values that `k` should not be equal to.
   - Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to represent the upper and lower bounds of `k`, respectively. These are set to extreme values (`1000000007` and `-1`).

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - The program iterates over each constraint.
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Validity:**
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx > ax`. If true, it means there is no valid `k` that satisfies all constraints, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values between `bx` and `ax` that are not in the set `cx`.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Verification Against Example Cases

Let's verify the program with the example cases provided:

#### Test Case 1:
- Constraints: 
  - \(1 \geq 3\)
  - \(2 \leq 10\)
  - \(3 \neq 1\)
  - \(3 \neq 5\)

- `bx = 10`, `ax = 3`, `cx = {1, 5}`
- Since `bx > ax`, the result is `0`.

#### Test Case 2:
- Constraints:
  - \(1 \geq 5\)
  - \(2 \leq 4\)

- `bx = 4`, `ax = 5`, `cx = {}`
- Since `bx < ax`, the valid range is from `4` to `5` but there are no values in `cx` in this range. Thus, the result is `1`.

#### Test Case 3:
- Constraints:
  - \(3 \neq 6\)
  - \(3 \neq 7\)
  - \(1 \geq 2\)
  - \(1 \geq 7\)
  - \(3 \neq 100\)
  - \(3 \neq 44\)
  - \(2 \leq 100\)
  - \(2 \leq 98\)

- `bx = 98`, `ax = 2`, `cx = {6, 7, 100, 44}`
- Since `bx > ax`, the result is `0`.

#### Test Case 4:
- Constraints:
  - \(1 \geq 5\)
  - \(2 \leq 10\)
  - \(1 \geq 9\)
  - \(2 \leq 2\)
  - \(3 \neq 2\)
  - \(3 \neq 9\)

- `bx = 9`, `ax = 2`, `cx = {2, 9}`
- Since `bx > ax`, the result is `0`.

#### Test Case 5:
- Constraints:
  - \(1 \geq 1\)
  - \(2 \leq 2\)
  - \(3 \neq 1\)
  - \(3 \neq 2\)
  - \(3 \neq 3\)

- `bx = 2`, `ax = 1`, `cx = {1, 2, 3}`
- Since `bx > ax`, the result is `0`.

#### Test Case 6:
- Constraints:
  - \(1 \geq 10000\)
  - \(2 \leq 900000000\)
  - \(3 \neq 500000000\)
  - \(1 \geq 100000000\)
  - \(3 \neq 10000\)
  - \(3 \neq 900000001\)

- `bx = 100000000`, `ax = 900000000`, `cx = {500000000, 10000, 900000001}`
- The valid range is from `100000000` to `900000000` excluding the values in `cx`. The count of valid `k` is `800000000`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly processes the constraints and outputs the correct number of valid `k` values for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
