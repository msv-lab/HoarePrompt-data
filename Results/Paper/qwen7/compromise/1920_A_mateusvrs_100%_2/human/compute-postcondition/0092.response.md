Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the minimum of the first and second integers from the input, `x` is the second integer from the input**.

Explanation: The line `ax = min(x, ax)` updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. Since `ax` is the same as `a` in this context, `a` is updated to be the minimum of the first and second integers from the input. The value of `x` remains the second integer from the input, and `n` remains greater than 0 as no operation affects it.
