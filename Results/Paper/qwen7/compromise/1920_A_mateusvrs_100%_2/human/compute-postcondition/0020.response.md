Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is a set containing `x` or an empty set, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000000)`, `bx` is -1, `a` is either 2 or not 1, `x` is an input integer, `_` is 1.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If `a` equals 1, `bx` becomes the maximum of `x` and `-1`, and `cx` remains an empty set or contains `x`. If `a` is not 1, `cx` becomes a set containing `x` or remains empty, `ax` becomes `min(x, 1000000000)`, and `bx` remains `-1`.
