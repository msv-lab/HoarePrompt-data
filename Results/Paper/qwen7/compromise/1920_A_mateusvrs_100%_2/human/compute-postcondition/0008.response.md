Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000000, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `_` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `x`. The other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `cx`, `ax`, `bx`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The input integers are converted to integers using `map(int, ...)` and then unpacked into `a` and `x`.
