Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in cx`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `cx`. Each iteration takes an element `i` from `cx`.

3. **Postcondition analysis**: The postcondition states that `cx` must contain at least one element, and if the index `i` is within the range from `bx` to `ax` (inclusive), then `tmp` is increased by 1. If `i` is not within this range, `tmp` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **`cx`**: Since the loop continues as long as `cx` contains at least one element, we need to ensure that `cx` still has at least one element at the start of the next iteration.
   - **`i`**: The value of `i` changes with each iteration, but it does not affect the loop condition directly. We need to ensure that the next element in `cx` is processed.
   - **`tmp`**: The value of `tmp` is determined by whether `i` is within the range from `bx` to `ax`. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to specify the exact value of `tmp` unless it affects the loop condition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `cx` still contains at least one element, and `i` is set to the next element in `cx`.

**Answer**:
State: **`cx` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the next element in `cx`**
