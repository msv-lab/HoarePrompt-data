Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 1, `bx` remains unchanged. If `a` equals 2, `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and `ax`. Otherwise, `x` is added to the set `cx`, and `cx` contains the elements `{x}`.
