You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, each test case contains an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each constraint, a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        cx = set()
        
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        
        bx = -1
        
        for _ in range(n):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `r` is a list containing either one element which is 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, `n` is the total number of iterations executed, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1, and `r` is calculated based on whether `bx` is greater than `ax`. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, then `r` is [0]. Otherwise, `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
    #- `t` is set to 0 since the initial value of `t` has been exhausted.
    #- `r` will contain either 0 or the calculated value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` based on the conditions inside the loop.
    #- `n` will be the total number of iterations that were executed.
    #- `cx` will contain all unique `x` values for which `a` was not 1.
    #- `ax` will be the smallest `x` value for which `a` was 2.
    #- `bx` will be the largest `x` value for which `a` was 1.
    #- `r` will be 0 if `bx` is greater than `ax`; otherwise, it will be `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` counts how many elements in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: 0 or ax - bx + 1 - tmp (where ax is the minimum value of x where a was 2, bx is the maximum value of x where a was 1, and tmp is the count of elements in cx that are within the range [bx, ax])
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a result based on a series of constraints involving integers t, n, a, and x, where t ranges from 1 to 500, n ranges from 2 to 100, a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x ranges from 1 to 10^9. The function checks these constraints and returns a result according to the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
