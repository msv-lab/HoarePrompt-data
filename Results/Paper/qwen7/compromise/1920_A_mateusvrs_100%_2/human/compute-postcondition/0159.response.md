Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in cx:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the role of these objects**: 
   - `i` is the variable that will take on each value from the set `cx` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, `cx` must contain at least one element. If `cx` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The value of `i` will be an element from `cx` during each iteration, but we don't need to specify the exact value of `i` since it will vary depending on the contents of `cx`.

4. **Consider the given states**:
   - `n` must be equal to the total number of iterations executed.
   - `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` where `a` was 1.
   - `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1.
   - `r` could be 0 or any other value based on the conditions.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` where `a` was 2.
   - `a` is the last input integer.
   - `x` is the last input integer.
   - `bx` is not greater than `ax`.
   - `tmp` is 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `n` represents the total number of iterations, and the loop iterates over `cx`, `n` should be equal to the size of `cx`.
   - `cx` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `n` must be equal to the size of `cx`.
- `cx` must contain at least one element.

State: **`n` must be equal to the size of `cx`, `cx` must contain at least one element**
