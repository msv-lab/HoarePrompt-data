Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `r` is a list containing either [0] or [ax - bx + 1 - tmp], `n` is an input integer, `cx` contains all unique `x` values that were added to it during the loop, `ax` is the smallest `x` value among those for which `a` was 2, or remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided, `bx` is the largest `x` value among those for which `a` was 1, or remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided, and `_` reflects the total number of iterations, which is equal to the original value of `n`.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the input value to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
