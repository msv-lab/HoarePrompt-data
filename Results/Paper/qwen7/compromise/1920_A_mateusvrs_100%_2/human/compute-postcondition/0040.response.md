Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `r` is a list containing [0], `n` is 0, `cx` contains all unique `x` values that were added to it during the loop, `ax` is the smallest `x` value among those for which `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest `x` value among those for which `a` was 1, or remains -1 if no such `x` values were provided, and `_` reflects the total number of iterations, which is equal to the original value of `n`.**

The code `r.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `bx > ax` remains true.
