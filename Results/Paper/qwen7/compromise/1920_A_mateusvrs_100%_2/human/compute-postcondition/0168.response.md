Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in cx`.

2. **Determine the variables that can be adjusted**: The only variables directly involved in the loop head are `i` and `cx`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `cx`. After each iteration, `i` takes the next element from `cx`.

4. **Analyze the given postcondition**:
   - `n` is equal to the size of `cx`.
   - `cx` contains at least one element.
   - `i` is the next element in `cx`.
   - `tmp` is incremented by 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `cx`, after the current iteration, `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
   - `n` will be decremented by 1 because one element has been processed.
   - `cx` will have one less element (i.e., `cx` will be `cx[1:]`).

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `n` will be `n - 1`.
   - `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
   - `cx` will be `cx[1:]` (all elements except the first one).
   - `tmp` remains unchanged unless `i` meets the condition to increment it, but since we are adjusting the state for the next iteration, we don't know the exact value of `tmp` yet.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is equal to the size of `cx` minus 1, `cx` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is incremented by 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.**
