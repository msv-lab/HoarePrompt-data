Postcondition: `i` is a non-zero integer, `j` is `len(b)`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]`. If `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]`, then no change is made to `i` and `j`. Otherwise, if `dp[i][j]` does not equal `dp[i][j - 1]`, `i` is decremented by 1. If `i` is decremented by 1, `j` remains `len(b)`. If `i` is decremented by 3, `j` becomes `len(b) - 1`.
