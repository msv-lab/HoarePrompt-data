Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a string `a` and a list of integers `b`. It calculates the longest common subsequence between the string `a` and the list `b` converted to a string representation. The function then constructs this longest common subsequence and returns it as a string. If no common subsequence exists, it returns an empty string.**
