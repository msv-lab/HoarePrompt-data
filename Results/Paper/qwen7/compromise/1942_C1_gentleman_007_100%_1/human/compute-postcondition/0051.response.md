Postcondition: `ver` is the first element in `q` after applying `popleft()`, all nodes in the graph that are reachable from the starting node `ver` have been visited, and `q` contains the remaining elements (if any) after removing the first element, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is set to the first element in `graph[ver]`, and the node `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is False).
