Output State: **`q` now contains the elements `[ver, node]`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one unvisited neighbor, `node` is a neighbor of `ver` in the graph, and `vis[node]` is currently `True`.**

Explanation: The code `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of `vis[node]` to `1`, which is equivalent to setting it to `True` since `True` is often represented as `1` in many programming contexts. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
