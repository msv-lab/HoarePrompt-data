Postcondition: **`i` is a non-zero integer. If `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i - 1][j]`, then `i` remains unchanged and `j` stays as `len(b)`. Otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1 and `j` becomes `len(b)` if the decrement occurs due to the condition being true, or `j` remains as `len(b) - 1` if the decrement occurs due to the else condition.**
