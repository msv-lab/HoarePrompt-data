Output State: **`q` now contains the original elements plus `node`, `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is set to the first element in `graph[ver]`, and the node `node` has not been visited (`vis[node]` is False), `vis[node]` is now 1.**

Explanation: The code `vis[node] = 1` sets the value of `vis[node]` to 1, indicating that the node has been visited. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
