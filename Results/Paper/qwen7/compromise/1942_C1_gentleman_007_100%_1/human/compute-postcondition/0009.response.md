Output State: **`graph[ver]` must contain at least one element, `node` is not visited (`vis[node]` is False), `q` contains the node**.

Explanation: The code `q.append(node)` appends the `node` to the list `q`. The initial state indicates that `node` is not visited (`vis[node]` is False) and `graph[ver]` must contain at least one element. After executing the code, `node` is added to the list `q`, while the other conditions remain unchanged.
