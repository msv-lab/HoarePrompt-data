Output State: **`i` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `j` is `len(b)`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is an empty list, and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`**

Explanation: The code `j -= 1` decrements the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` was set to `len(b) + 1`. After decrementing, `j` becomes `len(b)`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
