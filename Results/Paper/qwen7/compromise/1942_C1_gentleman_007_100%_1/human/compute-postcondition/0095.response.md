Output State: **`i` is `i-1`, `j` is `len(b)-1`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is now a list containing `a[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` was either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]`. After appending `a[i]` to `l`, `l` becomes a list containing `a[i]` if it was initially empty, or it remains a list containing `a[i]` if it already had `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
