Output State: **`i` is a non-zero integer decreased by 1, `j` is `len(b) + 1`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is an empty list, and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`, and `dp[i][j]` is not equal to `dp[i - 1][j]`**.

This means that the value of `i` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged from their initial state.
