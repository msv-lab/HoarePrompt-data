Output State: **`i` must be greater than 0, `j` is `len(b) - 1`, the `dp` matrix contains the lengths of the longest common subsequences for all pairs `(a[k], b[l])` where `0 <= k < len(a)` and `0 <= l < len(b)`, `l` is either an empty list or a list containing `a[i]`**.

The code `j -= 1` decrements the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was originally equal to `len(b)`, after executing the code, `j` becomes `len(b) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
