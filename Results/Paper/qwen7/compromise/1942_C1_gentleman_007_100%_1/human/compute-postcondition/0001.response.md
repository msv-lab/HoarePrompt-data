Output State: **`q` is a deque() instance with `ver` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `q.append(ver)` appends the value `ver` to the deque `q`. Since `q` was initially a deque instance, after appending `ver`, `q` remains a deque instance but now contains `ver` as its first element (if it was empty before) or as the last element if it had other elements.
