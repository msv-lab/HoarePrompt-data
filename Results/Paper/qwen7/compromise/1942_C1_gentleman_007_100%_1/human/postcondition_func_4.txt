The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a list `l` where each element `l[y]` contains a list of all vertices `x` that are directly connected to vertex `y` through the function calls made during the loop's iterations. The function constructs this list by iterating `m` times, each time calling another function `func_1` to get two vertices `x` and `y`, and then adding `x` to the list of `y` and vice versa.
