### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the given vertices.
   - Any convex polygon can be divided into triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.
   - The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed in a convex polygon with \( n \) vertices is \( n - 2 \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Given \( y = 0 \), Bessie cannot choose any additional vertices.
   - The maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the \( x \) vertices Bessie has already chosen is \( x - 2 \) if \( x \geq 3 \). If \( x = 2 \), no triangles can be formed.

3. **Given Constraints**:
   - \( n \) (number of sides of the polygon) ranges from 4 to \( 10^9 \).
   - \( x \) (number of vertices already chosen by Bessie) ranges from 2 to \( \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) \).
   - \( y \) (maximum number of additional vertices you can choose) is 0 in this version of the problem.

4. **Solution Approach**:
   - Since \( y = 0 \), Bessie cannot choose any additional vertices.
   - The maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the \( x \) vertices Bessie has already chosen is \( x - 2 \) if \( x \geq 3 \). If \( x = 2 \), no triangles can be formed.

5. **Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code defines numerous utility functions that are not used in solving the specific problem at hand.
   - The relevant logic to determine the maximum number of triangles based on the given constraints is missing.
   - The code does not contain any function that computes the maximum number of triangles based on the number of chosen vertices \( x \).

6. **Relevant Functions**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads the input and returns a list of integers, which could be used to read the vertices Bessie has chosen.
   - The function `func_3()` creates a list of a given value repeated \( n \) times, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - The function `func_13()` performs prime factorization, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - The function `func_14()` calculates the sum of Euler's totient function, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - The function `func_25()` performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph, which is not relevant to the problem.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. It lacks the function to compute the maximum number of triangles based on the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given code does not correctly solve the problem as described. It lacks the necessary logic to determine the maximum number of triangles based on the given constraints.
