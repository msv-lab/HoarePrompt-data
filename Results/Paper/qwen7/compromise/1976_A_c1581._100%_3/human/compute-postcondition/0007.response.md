Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `digits`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 because `range(len(digits))` generates indices starting from 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `digits`. Therefore, `i` must be less than the length of `digits`.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant objects**:
   - `password`: This is not directly involved in the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for this object.
   - `digits`: We need to ensure that `digits` is a non-empty list since the loop should be able to iterate at least once.
   - `letters`: This is not directly involved in the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for this object.
   - `i`: We know `i` starts at 0.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed are:

- `i` is 0.
- `digits` must be a non-empty list (i.e., its length must be at least 1).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `digits` must have at least 1 element**
