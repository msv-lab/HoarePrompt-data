Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly separates the digits and letters from the input password.
2. It sorts both the digits and letters individually.
3. It then checks if the concatenated, sorted version of the digits and letters matches the original password.
4. The logic for checking if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order and if there are no digits coming after letters is correctly implemented.
5. The overall structure of the function ensures that the conditions specified in the problem statement are met.

Given the annotated program and the reasoning above, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required logic to verify if a password is strong according to the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
