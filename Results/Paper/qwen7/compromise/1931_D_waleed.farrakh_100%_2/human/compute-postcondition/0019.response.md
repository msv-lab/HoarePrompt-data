Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 2, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer, and `test_cases` has been appended with a new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`**

Explanation: The code `idx += 2` increments the value of `idx` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented `idx`, the unchanged `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `test_cases`.
