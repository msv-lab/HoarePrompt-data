Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `results`**: The problem statement mentions that `test_cases` is an empty list. However, the loop is iterating over `results`, not `test_cases`. Therefore, we need to determine what `results` contains.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `result`**: Since the loop is iterating over `results`, `result` will take on the values from `results` one by one during each iteration. Initially, `result` is not defined in the given state.

4. **Adjust the States**: For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. If `results` is empty, the loop will not execute. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 0
- `idx` is 4
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are as they were in the last iteration of the loop
- `test_cases` is an empty list

We need to ensure that `results` is not empty for the loop to execute.

**Final State Adjustment**:
State: **`t` is 0, `idx` is 4, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are as they were in the last iteration of the loop, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` must contain at least one element**
