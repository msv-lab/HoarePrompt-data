Output State: **`arr` is the fifth element of the next `test_case` and contains at least one element; `a` is the value of `arr`; `rx` is ((-a % x + x) % x); `ry` is a % y.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a` (which is the value of `arr`) to `ry`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the state of `arr`, `a`, and `rx` remains unchanged, and `ry` is now assigned the value of `a % y`.
