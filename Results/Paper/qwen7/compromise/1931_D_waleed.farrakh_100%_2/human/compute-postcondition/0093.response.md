Output State: **`arr` must not be empty, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `rx` using the formula `(-a % x + x) % x`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a` and `x`, `rx` is calculated based on these variables. The precondition that `arr` must not be empty remains unchanged.
