Output State: **`arr` must not be empty, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `count` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the tuple `(a % x, a % y)` to the variable `current_pair`. The values of `arr`, `rx`, `ry`, and `count` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `arr` must not be empty, `rx` remains as `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` remains as `a % y`, and `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`. The value of `count` remains unchanged.
