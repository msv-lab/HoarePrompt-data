Output State: **`arr` must not be empty, `a` is the next element in `arr`, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `count` is increased by `freq[current_pair]` if `current_pair` is in `freq`, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `freq[current_pair]` is 1**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `freq[current_pair]` to 1. This means that the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
