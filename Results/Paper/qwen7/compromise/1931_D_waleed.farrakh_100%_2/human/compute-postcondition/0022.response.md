Output State: **`t` is 0, `idx` is 4, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are as they were in the last iteration of the loop, `test_cases` is an empty list.**

Explanation: 
- `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop until it reaches 0, so `t` is now 0.
- `idx` starts at 4 (since `idx` is `2 * t` when `t` is 0) and increments by 2 in each iteration. Since `t` goes through 3 iterations (from 1 to 0), `idx` will be 4 after these iterations.
- The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from the last iteration of the loop.
- `test_cases` contains `t` tuples, and since `t` is now 0, `test_cases` is an empty list.
