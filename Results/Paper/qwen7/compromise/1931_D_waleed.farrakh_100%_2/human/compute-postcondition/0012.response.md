Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by splitting the string at `data[idx + 1]` and converting each resulting substring to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `t` is updated to `t - 1` as stated in the initial condition.
