Output State: **`arr` must not be empty, `a` is the next element in `arr`, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `count` remains unchanged, and `freq[current_pair]` is either incremented by 1 or remains 1; `rx` is updated to (-a % x + x) % x.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rx` to `(-a % x + x) % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
