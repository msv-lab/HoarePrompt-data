Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `idx` is 4
- `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are as they were in the last iteration of the loop
- `test_cases` is an empty list
- `results` must contain at least one element

The `print(result)` statement will print the value of the `results` variable, which contains at least one element from the last iteration of the loop. Since the exact value of `results` is not specified, we can only say that it contains at least one element.

Output: **result (where result contains at least one element from the last iteration of the loop)**
