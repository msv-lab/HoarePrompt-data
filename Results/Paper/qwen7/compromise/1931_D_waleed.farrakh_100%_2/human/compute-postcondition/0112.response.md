Output State: **`arr` must not be empty, `a` is the next element in `arr`, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `count` is incremented by `freq[rx, ry]`, and `freq[current_pair]` is either incremented by 1 or remains 1.**

Explanation: The line `count += freq[rx, ry]` increments the `count` variable by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. The values of `arr`, `a`, `rx`, `ry`, `current_pair`, and `freq[current_pair]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
