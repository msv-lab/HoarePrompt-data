Output State: `t` is 0, `idx` is 4, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are as they were in the last iteration of the loop, `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` contains at least 3 elements.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains 0, `idx` remains 4, and the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` retain their state from the last iteration of the loop. The `test_cases` list remains empty. Importantly, the `results` list now contains at least 3 elements, as it did after the first three iterations.
