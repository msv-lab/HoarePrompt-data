Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for a in arr:`. The objects involved here are `a` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `arr` is the next test case's array.
   - `a` is the variable that will take each element from `arr` in each iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `arr`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `arr` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `arr` is the only object that affects the loop's execution, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty.
   - The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `freq`, and `count` do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `arr` must not be empty.

**State: **`arr` must not be empty**
