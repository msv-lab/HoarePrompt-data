Output State: **`arr` must not be empty, `a` is the next element in `arr`, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x**.

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `rx` using the formula `(-a % x + x) % x`. Since `a` is the next element in `arr`, its value remains unchanged. The value of `rx` is determined by the given formula, but without specific values for `a` and `x`, we express `rx` in terms of these variables. The precondition that `arr` must not be empty also remains valid.
