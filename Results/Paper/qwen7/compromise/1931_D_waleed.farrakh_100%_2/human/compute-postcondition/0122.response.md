Output State: **`arr` must not be empty, `a` is the next element in `arr`, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y**

Explanation: The code assigns the remainder of `a` divided by `y` to `ry`. The value of `a` remains the same as the next element in `arr`, and `rx` also remains unchanged. The initial conditions for `arr`, `a`, and `rx` are still valid.
