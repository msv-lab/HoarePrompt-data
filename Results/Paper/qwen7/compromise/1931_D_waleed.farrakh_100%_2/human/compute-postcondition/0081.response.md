Output State: **`arr` is the fifth element of the next `test_case` and contains at least one element; `a` is the value of `arr`; `rx` is ((-a % x + x) % x); `ry` is a % y; `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y)**

Explanation: The code assigns the tuple `(a % x, a % y)` to the variable `current_pair`. The values of `arr`, `a`, `rx`, and `ry` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables along with the newly assigned `current_pair`.
