Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n-1`. For each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `q[w[j]]` will be incremented by 1.**

This means that if the loop runs `n` times (once for each value of `j` from 0 to `n-1`), the list `q` will have its elements at indices specified by the list `w` incremented by 1 for each occurrence of that index. The variable `j` will take on all integer values from 0 up to `n-1` as the loop iterates through all of its cycles.
