Output State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `n` is a positive integer, `q[j]` is a value greater than 0, `eta` is a list with the values `j`, `j + 1`, and `j + 2` appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Initially, `eta` contains `j` and `j + 1`. After appending `j` again, `eta` now contains `j`, `j + 1`, and `j + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
