Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is `j + 1` (meaning `j` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration).
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `q[j]` is a value greater than 0.
   - `eta` is a list with the value `j` appended.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, the new value of `j` is `j + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `j + 1` must be less than `n`, which implies `j < n - 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `q[j + 1]` must be a value greater than 0 because the loop continues based on this condition.
   - `eta` should now include the value `j + 1` appended to it.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` becomes `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `q[j + 1]` must be greater than 0.
   - `eta` must include the value `j + 1`.

Based on these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `j` is `j + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `q[j + 1]` is a value greater than 0, `eta` is a list with the values `j` and `j + 1` appended.**
