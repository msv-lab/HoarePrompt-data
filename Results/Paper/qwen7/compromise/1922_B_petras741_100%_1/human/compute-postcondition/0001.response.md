Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `buffer` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `buffer`. The value of `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). All other variables remain unchanged.
