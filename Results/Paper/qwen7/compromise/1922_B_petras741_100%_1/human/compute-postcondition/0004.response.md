Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `w`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The variable `buffer` is mentioned as an empty list in the initial state, but since no operation was performed on it within the given code, it remains an empty list. The variable `i` is also not affected by the code. The variable `n` is an input integer, which is used to split the input string, but its value is not stored anywhere in the given code.
