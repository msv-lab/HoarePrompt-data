Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is equal to `n + eta_ln`, `eta_ln` remains the same, `res` is updated according to the specified rules, and `rho` is updated accordingly. If `n` is less than 3, `i` remains 3, `n` remains the same, and `w` remains unchanged.**
