Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `q` is a list of `n+1` elements, all initialized to 0 except for the element at index `w[1]` which is now 1, `j` is 4, `q[w[j]]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Given that `j` is 4, `w[j]` is `w[4]`. Since `w[1]` was previously set to 1 and no other values in `w` are specified, we assume `w[4]` is not 1 and thus `q[w[4]]` is incremented by 1. As `q` is initialized to 0 for all indices except `w[1]` which is 1, `q[w[4]]` becomes 1.
