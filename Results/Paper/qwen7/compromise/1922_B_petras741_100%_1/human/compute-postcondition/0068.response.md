Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `q[w[2]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the code effectively becomes `q[w[2]] += 1`. Since no specific value for `w[2]` or `q` is provided, we only know that `q[w[2]]` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
