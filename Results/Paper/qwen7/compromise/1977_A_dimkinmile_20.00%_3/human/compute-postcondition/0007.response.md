Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. It returns a specific value based on the relationship between `n`, `m`, and `t`.**

Note: The actual processing logic based on `n`, `m`, and `t` is not described here as per the instruction to avoid detailing how the function operates.
