Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 100. The other variables (`n` and `m`) are now set to the integers input by the user.
