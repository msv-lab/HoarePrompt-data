### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the program. The function `func_1()` is defined but never called within the loop. Instead, the loop directly calls an undefined function, leading to a `NameError`.

The corrected version of the program should call `func_1()` inside the loop to process each test case. Here is the corrected version:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

In this corrected version, the loop correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1()` which reads `n` and `m` and prints the appropriate result based on the condition `n >= m`.

### Final Evaluation:

Since the original program does not correctly call the function `func_1()` within the loop, the provided program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
