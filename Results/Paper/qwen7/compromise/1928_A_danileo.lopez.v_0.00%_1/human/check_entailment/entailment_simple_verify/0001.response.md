### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can transform a given rectangle of dimensions \(a \times b\) into another rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - The key insight is that if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always achieve this transformation. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no such transformation is possible.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies when a transformation is possible based on the parity (odd/even nature) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - Specifically:
     - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and those smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form another rectangle.
     - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the only way to cut the rectangle would result in two smaller rectangles of odd dimensions, which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle of different dimensions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly as per the problem statement. For example:
     - \(1 \times 1\) (both dimensions are odd) → Output: "No"
     - \(2 \times 1\) (one dimension is even) → Output: "Yes"
     - \(2 \times 6\) (both dimensions are even) → Output: "Yes"
     - \(3 \times 2\) (one dimension is even) → Output: "Yes"
     - \(2 \times 2\) (both dimensions are even) → Output: "Yes"
     - \(2 \times 4\) (both dimensions are even) → Output: "Yes"
     - \(6 \times 3\) (both dimensions are even) → Output: "No"

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the expected output based on the input values of \(a\) and \(b\).

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the program and the annotated code, we confirm that the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given dimensions. The program accurately handles all edge cases and follows the specified rules.

**Correctness: True**

### Final:
Final: **True**
