Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. However, this logic is incomplete. According to the problem description, a rectangle can be divided into two smaller rectangles, and from those, another rectangle can be formed if at least one of the dimensions is even. The program fails to consider the case where both `a` and `b` are odd but can still form another rectangle by cutting them into smaller rectangles and recombining them.

For example, consider the input `3 3`. Both dimensions are odd, but the rectangle can still be cut into two `3 \times 1` rectangles, and then those can be combined to form a `3 \times 2` rectangle, which is different from the original `3 \times 3` rectangle. The program would incorrectly output "No" for this case.
