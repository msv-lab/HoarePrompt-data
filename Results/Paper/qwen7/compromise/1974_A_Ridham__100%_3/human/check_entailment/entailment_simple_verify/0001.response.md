### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to determine its correctness, focusing on the key areas identified in the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `space_x` as `x * 1`, which is correct because each `1x1` icon occupies 1 cell.
   - It calculates `space_y` as `y * 4`, which is also correct because each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells.
   - The total space required is calculated as `total_space = space_y + space_x`. This is correct.

3. **Screen Requirement for `2x2` Icons**:
   - The program calculates `screen_require_for_y` as `y // 2` if `y` is even, and `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd. This is almost correct but not entirely accurate. The correct calculation should be `y // 2 + (1 if y % 2 != 0 else 0)` to ensure that all `2x2` icons are accounted for properly.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `remaining_cells` as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This is correct because each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

5. **Checking Space Availability**:
   - The program checks if `space_x <= remaining_cells`. If this condition is true, it means all `1x1` icons can fit within the available space on the current number of screens. This logic is correct.
   - However, there is a mistake in how the additional screens are calculated. The program should calculate the exact number of additional screens needed to accommodate the remaining `1x1` icons. The current logic does not correctly handle this.

6. **Additional Screens Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of extra screens needed using `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`. This is partially correct but does not account for the fact that each screen can hold up to 15 cells. The correct approach would be to divide the remaining cells by 15 and round up to the nearest integer.

### Corrected Approach:
- Calculate the number of screens needed for `2x2` icons.
- Calculate the remaining space after placing `2x2` icons.
- Calculate the number of additional screens needed to fit the remaining `1x1` icons using ceiling division.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Calculate Screens for `2x2` Icons**:
   ```python
   screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + (1 if y % 2 != 0 else 0)
   ```

2. **Calculate Remaining Space**:
   ```python
   remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
   ```

3. **Check if Remaining `1x1` Icons Fit**:
   ```python
   if space_x <= remaining_cells:
       result.append(screen_require_for_y)
   else:
       extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
       extra_screens = (extra_space + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division
       result.append(screen_require_for_y + extra_screens)
   ```

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        space_y = y * 4
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + (1 if y % 2 != 0 else 0)
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            extra_screens = (extra_space + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division
            result.append(screen_require_for_y + extra_screens)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Conclusion:
The corrected program now correctly calculates the number of additional screens needed to fit the remaining `1x1` icons. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate, and the program needs to be fixed as described above.

### Final:
**False**

The original program was incorrect due to the mistake in calculating the number of additional screens needed. The corrected program addresses this issue.
