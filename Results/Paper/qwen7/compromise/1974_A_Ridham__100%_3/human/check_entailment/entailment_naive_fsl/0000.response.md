Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. Specifically, the calculation of `remaining_cells` and the subsequent logic to determine the number of additional screens required do not accurately reflect the problem constraints.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
12 4
```

According to the problem description, we need to place 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2. Each screen has 15 cells (5x3). The 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells each, so 4 icons will occupy \(4 \times 4 = 16\) cells, which exceeds the capacity of a single screen. Therefore, we need at least 2 screens to accommodate these icons.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed. It first calculates the space required for the 2x2 icons and then tries to fit the 1x1 icons into the remaining space. This approach fails to account for the fact that the 2x2 icons cannot be split across screens, and it does not properly handle the case where the total number of cells required exceeds the available space.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of full screens needed for the 2x2 icons and then determining how many additional screens are required to fit the remaining 1x1 icons. Here's a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the number of full screens needed for 2x2 icons
        full_screens_for_y = (y + 3) // 4
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * full_screens_for_y - (y * 4)
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_x = (x + remaining_cells - 1) // 15
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = full_screens_for_y + additional_screens_for_x
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of screens is calculated correctly based on the constraints of the problem.
