### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading pairs of integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x = x * 1`: This correctly calculates the total space required for `x` icons of size `1x1`.
   - `space_y = y * 4`: This correctly calculates the total space required for `y` icons of size `2x2`, since each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells.

3. **Screen Requirement Calculation for `2x2` Icons**:
   - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even.
   - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.
   - This calculation is correct because each `2x2` icon requires 2 cells per row and 2 cells per column, which fits perfectly into a `5x3` grid when considering full screens.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`: This correctly calculates the remaining cells after placing all `2x2` icons.

5. **Checking Remaining Space for `1x1` Icons**:
   - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it means there is enough space to fit all `1x1` icons in the current number of screens.
   - Otherwise, additional screens are needed to accommodate the remaining `1x1` icons.

6. **Handling Extra Space**:
   - The logic for calculating `extra_screen` is correct. It ensures that any remaining space that cannot be fully utilized in the current screen count is accounted for by adding an extra screen.

7. **Output**:
   - The results are stored in the `result` list and printed correctly using `'\n'.join(map(str, result))`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for each test case based on the given constraints and logic.

### Correctness:
**True**
