Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the space required for `x` (1x1) icons as `x * 1`.
   - The space required for `y` (2x2) icons is calculated as `y * 4`.

3. **Screen Requirement Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of screens required for `y` (2x2) icons using `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even, and `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons are calculated as `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This is correct because each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

5. **Space for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program checks if there is enough space in the remaining cells to fit all 1x1 icons (`if space_x <= remaining_cells`). If not, it calculates the additional screens required to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

6. **Handling Remaining Space**:
   - The program correctly handles the remaining space calculation and determines the number of extra screens needed using `extra_screen = (space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1` if there is any remaining space that needs additional screens.

7. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the results for each test case, one per line.

Given the above analysis, the program logic seems to correctly implement the requirements and constraints of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
