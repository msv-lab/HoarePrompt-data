Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `arr` is a list of \( n-1 \) integers where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).
   - `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is initially 0.
   - `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
   - The loop continues until `ans[i + 1]` is no longer less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 3` (since `range(n - 2)` means it stops at `n - 3`).

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know it updates `ans[i + 1]` based on the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `ans` is updated such that `ans[i]` (for \( 0 \leq i < n \)) is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i-1]`.
   - The loop continues until `ans[i + 1]` is no longer less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` is updated such that `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i]`.

Given these points, let's determine the states at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
- `ans` is updated such that `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`arr` is a list of \( n-1 \) integers where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \), `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is updated such that `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i]`, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
