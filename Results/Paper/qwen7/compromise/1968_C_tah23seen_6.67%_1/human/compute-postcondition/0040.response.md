Output State: **`ans` is a list where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `1 â‰¤ i < n`, `ans[i]` is the sum of a sequence starting from `arr[0] + 1` and doubling each step, truncated when the next term would exceed `arr[i]`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[-2]` plus `arr[-1]`.**

This means that the initial value of `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element in the list, starting from `ans[1]`, the value is determined by continuously doubling the previous value in the sequence until adding the next doubled value would make the sum exceed the corresponding value in `arr`. The final element `ans[-1]` is simply the sum of all elements in `ans` except the last one, plus `arr[-1]`.
