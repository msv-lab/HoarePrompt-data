Output State: **The program returns a list 'ans' where ans[0] is arr[0] + 1, and for each 1 ≤ i < n, ans[i] is the sum of a sequence starting from arr[0] + 1 and doubling each step, truncated when the next term would exceed arr[i]. The last element ans[-1] is the sum of all previous elements in ans up to ans[-2] plus arr[-1]**.

This means the program returns a list `ans` that is constructed as follows:
- The first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
- For each subsequent element `ans[i]` (where `1 ≤ i < n`), it starts from `arr[0] + 1` and doubles the value each time until the next term would exceed `arr[i]`, then truncates.
- The last element `ans[-1]` is the cumulative sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[-2]` plus the last element of `arr`, `arr[-1]`.
