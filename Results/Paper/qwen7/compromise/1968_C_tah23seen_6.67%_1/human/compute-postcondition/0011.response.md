Output State: **`arr` is a list of \( n-1 \) integers where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \), `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is 0, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is 2, `arr[1]` is greater than or equal to `2 * arr[0] + 1`, `ans[1]` is `arr[1]`, `ans[2]` is `ans[1] + ans[0]`**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` increments `ans[i + 1]` by the value of `ans[i]`. Initially, `i` is set to 1, so the first operation updates `ans[2]` (since `i + 1` equals 2) to be the sum of `ans[1]` and `ans[0]`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
