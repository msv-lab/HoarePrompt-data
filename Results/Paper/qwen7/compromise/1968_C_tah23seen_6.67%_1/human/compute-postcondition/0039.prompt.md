Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 0, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2):
    ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
    if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
        while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            ans[i + 1] += ans[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of \( n-1 \) integers where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \), `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is 0, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and `ans[i]` (for \( 0 \leq i < n \)) is the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i-1]`, with the loop continuing until `ans[i + 1]` is no longer less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is updated such that `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` values up to `ans[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans[i + 1]` is updated to the sum of all previous `ans[i]` values up to the last iteration where the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` was satisfied. Specifically, `ans[i + 1]` accumulates the sum of a geometric progression starting from `ans[0]`, doubling each step, until it either exceeds `arr[i + 1]` or the loop terminates.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
