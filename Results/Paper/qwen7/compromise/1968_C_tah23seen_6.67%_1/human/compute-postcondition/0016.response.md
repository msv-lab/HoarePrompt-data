Output State: **`arr` is a list of \( n-1 \) integers where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \), `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is updated such that `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]`, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the `ans` list such that each element `ans[i + 1]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous element `ans[i]`. The `arr` list and the condition on its elements remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, but its exact value is not specified, only that it is now `i + 1`.
