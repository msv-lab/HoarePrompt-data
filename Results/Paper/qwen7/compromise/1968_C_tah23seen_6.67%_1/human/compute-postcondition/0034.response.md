Output State: The final value of `ans[i + 1]` will be the sum of `ans[i]` added to itself repeatedly until it exceeds `arr[i + 1]`. Specifically, `ans[i + 1]` will be the result of doubling `ans[i]` until it is no longer less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

In simpler terms, `ans[i + 1]` will be the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
