Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw and does not correctly implement the required logic to generate the array `a` based on the given constraints. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Logic**: The function `func_1` initializes `ans[0]` as `arr[0] + 1`, which is not necessarily correct. It should be initialized such that the condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true for all `i`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The loop that calculates subsequent elements of `ans` does not ensure that the modulo condition is met. Specifically, the line `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` does not guarantee that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that each `a_i` is chosen such that the modulo condition is satisfied. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    # Initialize the first element of ans
    ans[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Ensure that x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}
        ans[i] = ans[i-1] + arr[i-1] + 1
    return ans
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Initialization**: `ans[0]` is set to 1. This is a valid starting point since `x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1` can be satisfied with `a_2 = a_1 + x_2`.
2. **Loop Calculation**: For each subsequent element, `ans[i]` is calculated as `ans[i-1] + arr[i-1] + 1`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true.

This approach guarantees that the modulo condition is satisfied for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
