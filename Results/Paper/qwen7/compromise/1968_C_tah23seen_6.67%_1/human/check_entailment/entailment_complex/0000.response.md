Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to generate an array `a` such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`. Given the constraints, we need to ensure that each `a_i` is within the bounds `[1, 10^9]`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes `ans` with zeros and sets `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1`.
   - For each subsequent element `i` in `arr`, it calculates `ans[i]` as the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[i-1]`, ensuring that `ans[i]` is large enough to satisfy the modulo condition with `arr[i]`.
   - If `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`, it doubles `ans[i]` until it either exceeds `arr[i]` or the loop terminates.
   - Finally, `ans[-1]` is set to the sum of all previous elements in `ans` up to `ans[-2]` plus `arr[-1]`.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The initialization `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` ensures that `a_1` is at least `arr[0] + 1`, which is valid since `1 \le a_i \le 10^9`.
   - The loop for calculating `ans[i]` ensures that each `a_i` is chosen such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true.
   - The doubling mechanism ensures that `ans[i]` is large enough to satisfy the modulo condition without exceeding the upper bound of `10^9`.

Given the above analysis, the function correctly generates an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
