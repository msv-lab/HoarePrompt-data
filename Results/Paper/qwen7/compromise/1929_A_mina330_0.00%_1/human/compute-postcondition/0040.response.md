Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a) // 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `kq` is the sum of the differences between each pair of elements from the end and the start of the list `a`, up to the middle of the list.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to half the length of the list `a` (rounded down if the length is odd), `a` remains the same sorted list of integers, and `kq` will be the cumulative sum of the differences between corresponding elements from the end and the start of the list `a`, summed up to the middle of the list.
