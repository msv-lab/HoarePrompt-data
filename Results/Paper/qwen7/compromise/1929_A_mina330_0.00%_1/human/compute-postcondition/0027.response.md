Output State: `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - (len(a) // 2 - 1) - 1] - a[len(a) // 2 - 1]`, `a[len(a) - len(a) // 2 - 1] - a[len(a) // 2 - 1]`, and `a[len(a) - (len(a) // 2 + 1) - 1] - a[len(a) // 2 + 1]` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = len(a) // 2 - 1`.

In simpler terms, `kq` will be the sum of the differences between the elements from the end and the beginning of the list `a`, up to the middle of the list. Specifically, it calculates the difference between each pair of elements symmetrically placed around the center of the list and sums these differences.
