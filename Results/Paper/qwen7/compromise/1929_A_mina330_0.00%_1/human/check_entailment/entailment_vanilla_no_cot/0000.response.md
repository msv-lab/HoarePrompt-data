Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting the array and then pairing the smallest half with the largest half. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible beauty. The correct strategy to maximize the beauty involves arranging the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

To achieve the maximum beauty, we should sort the array and then pair the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the positive contributions to the beauty are maximized while minimizing the negative contributions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            kq += a[n - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly pairs the smallest and largest elements to maximize the beauty of the array.
