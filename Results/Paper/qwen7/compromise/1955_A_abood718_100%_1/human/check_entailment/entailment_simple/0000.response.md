### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Variable Assignment**: The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are assigned correctly from the input values `n`, `a`, and `b`.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - **Case 1**: If `B * 2 < C`, the program correctly prints `A * B`. This is because buying each yogurt at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion price when `B * 2 < C`.
   - **Case 2**: If `A % 2 == 0`, the program correctly prints `int(A * C / 2)`. This is because if the number of yogurts `A` is even, buying all yogurts in pairs using the promotion price is optimal.
   - **Case 3**: If `A % 2 != 0`, the program correctly calculates `X = A // 2` and prints `X * C + B`. This ensures that the remaining odd number of yogurts is bought at the regular price after maximizing the use of the promotion price.

4. **Output Generation**: The program generates the correct output for each test case based on the conditions provided. The output format matches the expected output as per the problem statement.

Given that the logic and conditions in the program match the problem requirements and the provided examples, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
