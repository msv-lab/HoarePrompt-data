Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It then reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price for one yogurt (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy yogurts individually at the regular price (`A * B`).
     - Otherwise, it uses the promotion price.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, it calculates the total cost using the promotion price (`A * C / 2`).

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible using the promotion price (`X * C`), and then adding the cost of the remaining yogurt at the regular price (`B`).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1: `B * 2 < C`**
  - If the regular price for two yogurts is cheaper than buying them individually, the program correctly prints `A * B`.
  - This is correct because buying individual yogurts would be cheaper in this scenario.

- **Case 2: `A % 2 == 0`**
  - If the number of yogurts is even, the program correctly calculates the total cost as `A * C / 2`.
  - This is correct because buying pairs of yogurts will minimize the cost.

- **Case 3: `A % 2 != 0`**
  - If the number of yogurts is odd, the program calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible using the promotion price (`X * C`), and then adding the cost of the remaining yogurt at the regular price (`B`).
  - This is also correct because it ensures the minimum cost by maximizing the use of the promotion.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the example cases provided:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculation: `2 * 5 = 10` (regular price) vs `9` (promotion price)
   - Output: `9` (correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculation: `3 * 5 = 15` (regular price) vs `9 * 1.5 = 13.5` (promotion price)
   - Output: `15` (correct, since 3 is odd, we buy 2 at promotion and 1 at regular)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculation: `3 * 5 = 15` (regular price) vs `11 * 1.5 = 16.5` (promotion price)
   - Output: `15` (correct, since 3 is odd, we buy 2 at promotion and 1 at regular)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculation: `4 * 5 = 20` (regular price) vs `11 * 2 = 22` (promotion price)
   - Output: `20` (correct, since 4 is even, we buy all at promotion)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all scenarios and produces the expected output based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
