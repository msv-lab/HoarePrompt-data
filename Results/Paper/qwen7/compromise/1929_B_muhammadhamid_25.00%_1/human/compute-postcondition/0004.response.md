Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, it prints a specific value based on the conditions: if \(k = 1\), it prints 1; if \(k \leq 2n\), it prints \(\text{math.ceil}(k/2)\); otherwise, it prints \(\text{k} // 2 + 1\). After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of lines, each containing one of the aforementioned values.**
