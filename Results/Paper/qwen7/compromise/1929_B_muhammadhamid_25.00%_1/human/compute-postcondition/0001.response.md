Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each representing the output of one test case. For each test case, if \(k = 1\), the output is 1. If \(k \leq 2n\), the output is \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\). Otherwise, the output is \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\).

This means the output will be a sequence of numbers based on the conditions provided in the loop, with each number corresponding to the result of processing each test case.
