Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(2, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `j` is 5
   - `sum` is 20
   - `i` is 2

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute again**:
   - The loop condition is `i in range(2, n + 1)`.
   - This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to the next value in the range, which would be 3.
   - Since `i` starts from 2 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` remains unchanged: `j` is 5.
   - `sum` remains unchanged: `sum` is 20.
   - `i` is updated to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 5, `sum` is 20, `i` is 3, `n` must be the same as before**.
