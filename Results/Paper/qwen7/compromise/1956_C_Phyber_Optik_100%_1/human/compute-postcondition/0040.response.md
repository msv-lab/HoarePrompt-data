Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is defined as `j_prev + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `j_prev + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement is `print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` is defined as `j_prev + 1`, `j` is one more than `j_prev`.

2. **Value of `n`:**
   - `n` must be greater than `j_prev + 1`. This means `n > j`.

3. **Expression `n - j + 1`:**
   - Substituting `j` with `j_prev + 1`, we get `n - (j_prev + 1) + 1 = n - j_prev`.

4. **Range Expression `*range(1, n + 1)`:**
   - This will generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. When unpacked with `*`, it will be printed as separate arguments.

### Putting It All Together:

- The first argument printed is `1`.
- The second argument printed is `n - j_prev`, which simplifies to `n - j + 1` since `j = j_prev + 1`.
- The third argument printed is the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` inclusive.

### Final Output:

Output: **1, n - j_prev, 1 2 3 ... n**
