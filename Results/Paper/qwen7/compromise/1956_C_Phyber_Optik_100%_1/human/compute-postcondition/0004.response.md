State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 2 in the `range(2, n + 1)` function.
- For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `sum`) are not directly involved in the loop's execution condition but are mentioned in the initial state. They do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are to set `i` to 2 and ensure `n` is greater than 1.
