Output State: `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, and `sum` is the sum calculated by the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `j` will have reached `n + 1` because the loop increments `j` from 1 to `n`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is an input parameter and is not modified within the loop. The variable `sum` accumulates the value according to the given formula for each `i` from 2 to `n`. Since the loop runs for all inputs `n` from 1 to 500, the final value of `sum` will depend on the specific value of `n` provided.
