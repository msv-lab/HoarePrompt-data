Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4, sum is 60**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sum` by adding the value of `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. Given that `i` is initially 5, we can calculate this expression as follows:
- `i * i` is `5 * 5` which equals `25`.
- `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `4 * 4` which equals `16`.
- So, `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `25 - 16` which equals `9`.
- Multiplying this result by `i` gives `9 * 5` which equals `45`.

Therefore, `sum` is updated to `sum + 45`. Since `sum` was initially `0` (implied from the context), the new value of `sum` is `45`. However, since the initial state mentions `sum` is positive without specifying its exact value, and no prior value of `sum` is given, we assume `sum` starts at `0` for calculation purposes.

The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged, with `i` being `5` and `n` being greater than `4`. Thus, the final output state is `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4, and `sum` is 60.
