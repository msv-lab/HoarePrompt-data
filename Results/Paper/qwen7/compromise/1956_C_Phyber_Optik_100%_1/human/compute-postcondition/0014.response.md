Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The expression `n - j + 1` will be evaluated. Since `j` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is simply `n`.
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will output three parts:
     1. The number `1`.
     2. The value of `n` (which is `n`).
     3. All the numbers generated by `range(1, n + 1)`, separated by spaces.

Given these steps, the output will be:

Output: **1 n 1 2 3 ... n-1 n** (where `n` is the input integer greater than or equal to 4)
