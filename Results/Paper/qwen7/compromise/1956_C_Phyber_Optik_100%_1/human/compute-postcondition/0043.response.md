Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is defined as `j_prev + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `j_prev + 2`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Determine the Values**:
   - Since `j = j_prev + 2`, we know that `j` is exactly 2 more than `j_prev`.
   - `n` is greater than `j_prev + 2`, so `n > j`.

4. **Calculate `n - j + 1`**:
   - We know `j = j_prev + 2`, so substituting this into `n - j + 1` gives us `n - (j_prev + 2) + 1 = n - j_prev - 1`.

5. **Range Calculation**:
   - The range `*range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

6. **Putting It All Together**:
   - The print statement will output three parts:
     1. The number `1`.
     2. The value `n - j_prev - 1`.
     3. The sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` (inclusive).

7. **Final Output**:
   - The output will be `1` followed by `n - j_prev - 1`, followed by the sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the final output is:

Output: **1, n - j_prev - 1, 1, 2, ..., n**
