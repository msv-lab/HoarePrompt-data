Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is:
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will start with `j` set to 1 and will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - The loop will run until `j` reaches `n + 1` (since `range(1, n + 1)` includes all integers from 1 to `n`).

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1, the initial value of `j` should be 1.
   - The value of `n` must be such that the loop can execute. Given that `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, and considering the final state where `i` is 5 (implying the loop has completed its iterations), `n` must be at least 4.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `j` starting at 1 and `n` being an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4.

**Final Output State**:
State: **`j` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4**
