Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `n` is defined such that it must be greater than 4, but its exact value is not specified.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The first argument to `print` is `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given `j = 1`, this simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is simply `n`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range object into individual arguments. This will print all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

3. **Output**:
   - The first part of the output will be `2`.
   - The second part will be `n` (the value of `n`).
   - The third part will be all integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Given the initial state and the code execution, the output will be:

Output: **2 n 1 2 3 ... n** (where `n` is any integer greater than 4)
