To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Identify Variables and Their Values:**
   - There are no explicit definitions of `n` or `j` in the initial state provided. Therefore, we need to assume these variables have specific values for the `print` statement to make sense.

2. **Analyze the Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is: `print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`
   - This statement will print three parts:
     1. The number `2`
     2. The expression `n - j + 1`
     3. The range of numbers from `1` to `n` (inclusive)

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `n` and `j` are not explicitly defined, we cannot determine their exact values. However, we can describe the output in terms of these variables.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The first part of the output will be the number `2`.
   - The second part will be the result of the expression `n - j + 1`.
   - The third part will be a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n` (inclusive).

Given this analysis, the output will be:

Output: **2, n - j + 1, 1 2 3 ... n (where n and j are unknown variables)**
