Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 30, `i` is 5.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` by 1 with each iteration and updates `sum` based on the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`. After 3 iterations, `i` is 4. Therefore, if the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be incremented to 5. Plugging `i = 5` into the formula gives us the final value of `sum` as 30.
