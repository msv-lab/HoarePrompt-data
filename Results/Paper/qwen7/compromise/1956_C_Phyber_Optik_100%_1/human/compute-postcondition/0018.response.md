Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Breaking Down the Print Statement**:
   - `2`: This is directly printed as it is.
   - `n - j + 1`: Given `j` is 2, this simplifies to `n - 2 + 1` or `n - 1`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: This unpacks the range object into individual numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The first part of the print statement is `2`.
   - The second part is `n - 1`.
   - The third part is the range of numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given these steps, the output will be:

Output: **2, n - 1, 1 2 3 ... n-1 n**
