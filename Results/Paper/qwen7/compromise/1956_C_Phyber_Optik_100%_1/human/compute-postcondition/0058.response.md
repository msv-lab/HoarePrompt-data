Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`. The variable `i` mentioned in the output state is not directly involved in the loop head but is derived from the loop's behavior.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` set to 1 as specified by the range `range(1, n + 1)`.

3. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration until `j` reaches `n + 1`. Therefore, after the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `n + 1`.

4. **Final Value of `sum`**: The value of `sum` is calculated using the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for all `i` from 2 to `n`. This calculation happens within the loop body, but the initial state of `sum` before the loop starts is not specified in the problem statement.

5. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop head involves `j` and `n`, we need to ensure these variables are correctly set for the loop to execute. Given that `i` is derived from the loop's behavior and its final value is `n + 1`, we don't need to adjust `i` explicitly. However, we need to ensure `n` is greater than 4 for the loop to execute properly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be set to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 4.

The final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 4**
