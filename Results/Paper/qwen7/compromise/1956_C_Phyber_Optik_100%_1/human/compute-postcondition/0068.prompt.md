Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 4, and `sum` is the sum calculated by the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\) for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

To explain this in more detail:
- The loop starts with `i` set to 2 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
- In each iteration, the value of `sum` is updated using the formula \((i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i\).
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` up to `n` inclusive.
- The final value of `sum` is the cumulative result of applying the given formula for each `i` from 2 to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
    print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 4

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
