Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program calculates a sum using a formula that does not relate to the operations described in the problem. Specifically, the program is trying to compute a sum based on a mathematical formula involving squares, which is not relevant to the operations of reassigning matrix elements through permutations.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should perform the specified operations (Type 1 and Type 2) to maximize the sum of the matrix elements. The given solution does not achieve this and instead computes an unrelated sum, making it incorrect.
