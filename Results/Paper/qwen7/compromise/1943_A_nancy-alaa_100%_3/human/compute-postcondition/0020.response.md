Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` remains False (though this variable is not used in the print statement)
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 0 (though `n` is also not used in the print statement)

The print statement `print(i)` will simply output the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
