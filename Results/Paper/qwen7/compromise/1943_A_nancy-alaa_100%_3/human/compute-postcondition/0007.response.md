Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`
- `i` is `0`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `0`
- The current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`

The code snippet simply prints the value of `i`.

Since `i` is explicitly stated to be `0`, the print statement will output `0`.

Output: **0**
