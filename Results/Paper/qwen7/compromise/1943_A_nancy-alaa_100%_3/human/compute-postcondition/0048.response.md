Output State: **`first` remains False, `i` is n + 1, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each integer in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` creates a Counter object named `mpp` which counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `arr`. The values of `first` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
