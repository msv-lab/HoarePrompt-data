Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for breaking out of the loop**: The loop can be broken if `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is `True`. However, since we are asked to consider the state at the start of the next iteration, we assume that the loop did not break out during the current iteration.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, we assume it stays the same.

Given the above points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- If `i` was less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- Since the loop did not break out, `first` remains `True`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n`, `first` is `True`**
