State: **`first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0 because the `range(n + 1)` function will generate a sequence from 0 to `n` inclusive.
3. The variable `first` is initially set to `False`, but this does not affect the loop's execution condition. The loop will start with `i` being 0 regardless of the value of `first`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being 0 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
