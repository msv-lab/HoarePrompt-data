Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by splitting the input using `split()` and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
