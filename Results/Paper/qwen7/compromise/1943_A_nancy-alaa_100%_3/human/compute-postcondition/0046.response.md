Output State: **`first` remains False, `i` is n + 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variables `first` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. The initial state of `i` was `n + 1`, which still holds true after the input is taken. The value of `n` is now the integer input provided by the user.
