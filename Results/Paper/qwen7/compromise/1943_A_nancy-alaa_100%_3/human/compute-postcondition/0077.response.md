Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, and `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the conditions remain as specified in the precondition.
