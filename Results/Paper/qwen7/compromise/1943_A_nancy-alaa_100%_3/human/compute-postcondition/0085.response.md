Output State: **Postcondition: `first` is a boolean, `i` is an integer, and `n` is an integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that was checking whether `i` is a key in `mpp`. Since the `break` statement does not modify the values of `first`, `i`, or `n`, these variables retain their initial conditions.
