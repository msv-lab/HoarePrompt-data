Output State: **`first` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, the current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `first`, `i`, `n`, or the condition regarding `i` being in the keys of `mpp`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block.
