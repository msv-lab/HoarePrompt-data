Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the MEX of the array `c` formed by the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
2. The provided code does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob. Instead, it tries to find the MEX of the input array `arr` directly, which is not the correct approach.
3. The logic in the provided code does not account for the different rules of the game for Alice and Bob. Specifically, Alice can pick any element from `arr`, append it to `c`, and remove it from `arr`. Bob can only pick an element from `arr` and remove it without appending to `c`.
4. The code assumes that the MEX can be determined by simply checking the presence of elements in the input array `arr` up to `n + 1`. This is incorrect because the game involves strategic choices by both players, and the final state of `c` depends on these choices.
5. The code does not handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob, nor does it ensure that Alice maximizes and Bob minimizes the MEX as required by the problem statement.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
