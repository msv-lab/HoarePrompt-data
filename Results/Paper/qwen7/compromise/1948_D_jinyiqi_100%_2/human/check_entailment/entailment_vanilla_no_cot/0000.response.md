Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function Call Issue**: The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop but never defined properly within the loop. It should be called with the input string `s` processed for replacing question marks.

2. **Logic for Replacing Question Marks**: The current logic checks if the substring can be a tandem repeat without actually replacing the question marks. It needs to try different combinations of replacing question marks with lowercase Latin letters to maximize the length of the tandem repeat substring.

3. **Replacement Logic**: The program should iterate through all possible replacements of question marks with lowercase letters and then check for the longest tandem repeat substring for each case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    max_length = 0
    # Try all possible replacements of '?' with lowercase letters
    for replacement in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', repeat=s.count('?')):
        new_s = s[:]
        for i, char in enumerate(replacement):
            new_s = new_s[:s.index('?', i)] + char + new_s[s.index('?', i) + 1:]
        n = len(new_s)
        for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
            count = 0
            for k in range(0, n - j):
                if new_s[k] == new_s[k + j] or (new_s[k] == '?' and new_s[k + j] == '?'):
                    count += 1
                else:
                    count = 0
                if count == j:
                    max_length = max(max_length, j * 2)
                    break
    print(max_length)
```

This corrected version tries all possible replacements of question marks and then checks for the longest tandem repeat substring for each case, ensuring the program meets the problem requirements.
