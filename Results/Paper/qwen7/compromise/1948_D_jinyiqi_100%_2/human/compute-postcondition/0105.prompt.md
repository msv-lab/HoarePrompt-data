Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `s` is a list of characters from the input string; `n` is the length of the list `s`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n - j):
        if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        if count == j:
            print(count * 2)
            return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `count` will be equal to `j` if the condition `s[k] == '?'` or `s[k + j] == '?'` or `s[k] == s[k + j]` holds for `j` consecutive times within the range `0` to `n - j`. If the condition does not hold for `j` consecutive times, `count` will be `0`. The value of `n` will remain at least 2, and `j` will remain less than or equal to `n - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the function has returned None. This means that within the loop, the condition `count == j` was never met for any value of `k` in the range from 0 to `n - j - 1`. Therefore, the function did not print anything and simply returned None after completing all iterations without finding a sequence where `count` reached the value of `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has completed all its iterations without returning, meaning `count` does not equal `j` at any point during the loop's execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
