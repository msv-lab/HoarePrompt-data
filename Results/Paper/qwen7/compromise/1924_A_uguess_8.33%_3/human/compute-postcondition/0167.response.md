Output State: **`tmp` is 'c', `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, and `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The variable `tmp` is updated to the character 'c', which is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + i)` where `i` is initially 2. After incrementing `i` by 1, `i` becomes 3. All other variables (`cnt`, `cur`, `ans`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
