Output State: The string `s` has been fully processed, meaning all characters in `s` have been iterated over. The variable `cur` is reset to 0 because it reaches the state where `cur == (1 << k) - 1` for the last time and gets reset to 0. The variable `cnt` holds the total number of times `cur` reached the state `(1 << k) - 1` during the entire iteration of the string `s`. The variables `i`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `cur_ss` retain their final values from the last iteration, but `cur` is back to 0.
