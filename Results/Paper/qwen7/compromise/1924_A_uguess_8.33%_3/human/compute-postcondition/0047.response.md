Output State: **`s` is an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of `chr(ord('a') + 1 - 1)` repeated `cnt` times, `i` is 2, `tmp` is `chr(ord('a') + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code `tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)` updates the value of `tmp` to be the character 'b' (since `i` is initially 1, and `chr(ord('a') + 1)` is 'b'). The other variables (`s`, `cur`, `cnt`, `ans`, and the condition for `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
