Output State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `cur` is `(1 << (cur_ss + 1)) - 1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 again, and `cur_ss` is the integer value of the current character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a'**.

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` increments the value of `cur` by shifting `1` to the left by `cur_ss` positions. Initially, `cur` is set to `(1 << k) - 1`. After the increment, `cur` becomes `(1 << k) - 1 + (1 << cur_ss)`, which simplifies to `(1 << (cur_ss + 1)) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, so `s`, `cnt`, and `cur_ss` retain their original properties and values.
