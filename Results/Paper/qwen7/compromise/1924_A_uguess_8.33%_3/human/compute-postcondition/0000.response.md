Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), input from user, all other variables are not defined.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^5\), the value of `t` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`) remain undefined as they are not affected by this line of code.
