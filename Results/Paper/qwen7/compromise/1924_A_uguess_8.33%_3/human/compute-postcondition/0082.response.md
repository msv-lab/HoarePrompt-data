Output State: **`cnt` is 2, `cur` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `cur & 1 << cur_ss` is true or false, and `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `cur` and `cur_ss` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet. Therefore, `cur` is still either 0 or 1 based on the condition `cur & 1 << cur_ss`, and `cur_ss` remains `ord(ss) - ord('a')`.
