Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `cnt` is 2
- `cur` is 0
- `cur_ss` remains as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is based on the variable `cur`. The loop continues as long as `cur` does not equal `(1 << k) - 1`.

### Loop Body Analysis
- If `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, then `cnt` becomes 2 and `cur` resets to 0.
- Otherwise, `cur` and `cur_ss` retain their original values.

### Current Values
- `cnt` is 2 (unchanged from the previous iteration)
- `cur` is 0 (unchanged from the previous iteration)
- `cur_ss` remains as `ord(ss) - ord('a')` (unchanged from the previous iteration)

### Next Iteration
Since `cur` is currently 0, it does not equal `(1 << k) - 1` (which would be a value like 1, 3, 7, etc., depending on `k`). Therefore, `cur` and `cur_ss` will retain their current values.

### Updated State
- `cnt` remains 2
- `cur` remains 0
- `cur_ss` remains as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`

### Final Answer
State: **`cnt` is 2, `cur` is 0, and `cur_ss` remains as `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**
