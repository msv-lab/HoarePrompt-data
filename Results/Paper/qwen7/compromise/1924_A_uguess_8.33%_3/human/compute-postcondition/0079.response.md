Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `cur` is 1, `cur_ss` is `ord(ss) - ord('a')`**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` shifts the binary number `1` to the left by `cur_ss` positions and adds it to `cur`. Initially, `cur` is `0`. Shifting `1` (which is `0001` in binary) to the left by `cur_ss` positions results in a `1` shifted left by `cur_ss` places. Since `cur_ss` is equal to `ord(ss) - ord('a')`, the value of `cur` becomes `1` shifted left by `ord(ss) - ord('a')` places, which is `1` if `cur_ss` is `0` (since shifting `1` left by `0` places leaves it as `1`). The values of `cnt` and `cur_ss` remain unchanged.
