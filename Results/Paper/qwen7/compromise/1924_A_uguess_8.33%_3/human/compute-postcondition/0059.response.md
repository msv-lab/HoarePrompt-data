Postcondition: **If the number of characters in the string `s` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `s` remains an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the number of characters in the original string `s`, and `cur_ss` is the integer value of the last character of `s` minus the integer value of 'a' if `s` is not empty; otherwise, it is undefined. Otherwise, `s` remains an empty string, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is less than `n`, `ans` is a string consisting of 'c' repeated `cnt` times followed by 'a' * (n - cnt - 1) times, and `tmp` is 'c'.**
