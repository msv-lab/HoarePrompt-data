Postcondition: **`cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, where each character's bit in the substring matches the corresponding bit in `cur`. `cur` is reset to 0, and `cnt` contains the final count. The loop continues until all characters in the string `s` have been processed, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
