Output State: **`ss` is the third character of the string `s`, `cnt` is 2, `cur` is 1 shifted left by the ASCII value of `ss` - ASCII value of 'a', `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` - ASCII value of 'a'**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1 << cur_ss` shifts the value `1` to the left by `cur_ss` bits and adds it to `cur`. Here, `cur_ss` is the ASCII value of `ss` minus the ASCII value of `'a'`. Since `ss` is the third character of the string `s`, `cur_ss` remains unchanged. The value of `cur` is updated by shifting `1` to the left by the number of bits equal to `cur_ss` and then adding it to the current value of `cur`.
