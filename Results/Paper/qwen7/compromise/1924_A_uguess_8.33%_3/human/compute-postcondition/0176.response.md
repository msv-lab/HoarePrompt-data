Output State: **`tmp` is 'e', `cnt` is the total count of valid substrings of length `k` found in the string `s`, `cur` is 0, `ans` is a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each character being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, `k` retains its initial state, and `ans` is now one character longer, with the last character being 'e'.**

In this step, the code appends the value of `tmp` (which is 'e') to the end of the string `ans`. Since `ans` was initially a string consisting of `cnt` characters, each being `chr(ord('a') + k - 1)`, after appending 'e', `ans` is now one character longer. The other variables remain unchanged.
