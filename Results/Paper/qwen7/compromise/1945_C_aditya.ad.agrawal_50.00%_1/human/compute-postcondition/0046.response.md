Postcondition: **`i` is the second element of the list `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is -1, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1, the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true, the condition `z_l >= (z_l + 1) / 2` is true, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `ans` is 3, `b_d` is 3.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering the condition in the if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly reflects the scenario where the condition in the if statement is satisfied, leading to the specified values for `ans` and `b_d`.
