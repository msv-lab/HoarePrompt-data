Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to the index where `ans` was last updated, `o_r` is the final count of 1s minus the final count of 0s seen so far, `z_r` is the final count of 0s minus the final count of 1s seen so far, `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n/2` and `pos`, `o_l` and `z_l` are the cumulative counts of 1s and 0s seen throughout the entire execution of the loop, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `input_string` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code converts each character in the `input_string` into an integer and stores these integers in the list `arr`. The other variables (`i`, `pos`, `o_r`, `z_r`, `b_d`, `o_l`, `z_l`, `n`, `t`, and `input_string`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
