`pos` is incremented by 1. Initially, `pos` is 2, so after the increment, `pos` becomes 3. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is the second element of the list `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1, the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true, the condition `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` is true, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `ans` is 1.

Output State: **`i` is the second element of the list `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is 0 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1, the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true, the condition `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` is true, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `ans` is 1.**
