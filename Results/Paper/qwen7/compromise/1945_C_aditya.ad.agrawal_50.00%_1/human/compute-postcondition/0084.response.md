Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second last element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, and `o_l` is 1.**

The code `o_l += 1` increments the value of `o_l` by 1. Given the initial state where `o_l` is assumed to be 0 (since no specific initial value is given), it now becomes 1. All other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `pos`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
