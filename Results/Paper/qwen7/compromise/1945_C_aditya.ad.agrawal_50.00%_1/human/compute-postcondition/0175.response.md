Output State: **All elements in `arr` have been processed, `pos` equals the length of `arr`, `z_l` and `z_r` are both 0, `o_l` equals the total number of 1s in `arr`, `o_r` equals the total number of -1s in `arr`, `b_d` equals `abs(n / 2 - len(arr))`, and `ans` equals the last position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` was satisfied, or remains 0 if no such position existed.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `pos` will be equal to the length of the array `arr`.
- `z_l` and `z_r` will both be 0 because they represent counts of zeros and ones respectively, which get adjusted within each iteration but end up being zero since every zero decreases `z_r` and every one decreases `o_r`.
- `o_l` will be the total count of 1s in the array, and `o_r` will be the total count of -1s in the array.
- `b_d` will be the absolute difference between the current position `pos` and `n/2`.
- `ans` will be the last position where the given condition was met during the loop's execution, or it will remain 0 if the condition was never satisfied.
