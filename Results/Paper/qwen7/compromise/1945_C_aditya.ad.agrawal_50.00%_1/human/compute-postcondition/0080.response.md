Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, the second last element of `arr` is 0, `pos` is 1, `z_l` is increased by 1**.

The code `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. Since no specific initial value for `z_l` was given, we only know that it has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
