Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the iterable `arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is being initialized to each element of `arr` in the loop, the initial value of `i` is irrelevant because it will change during each iteration. However, we need to ensure that `arr` is not empty so that the loop can execute at least once.

3. **Check the State of `arr`**: The loop will execute as long as `arr` is not empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least one element.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `z_l`, `o_l`, `dist`, `ans`, `pos`, and `b_d` are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute. They are modified within the loop body and their initial values do not affect the loop's ability to run.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `arr` to ensure it is not empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` must have at least one element**
