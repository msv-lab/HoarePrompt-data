Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `pos` is either 2 or increased by 1 to `o_l + 1`; `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is decreased by 1; the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true; the condition `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` is true; `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`; `ans` is equal to `pos`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b_d` to be the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged from the initial state.
