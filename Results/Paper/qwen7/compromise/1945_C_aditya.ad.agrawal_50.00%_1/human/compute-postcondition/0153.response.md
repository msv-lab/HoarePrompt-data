Output State: **`arr` must have at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 2**

Explanation: The variable `z_l` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `i` is the next element in `arr` and `pos` is increased by 1. After executing `z_l += 1`, `pos` is now increased by 2. The other conditions remain unchanged.
