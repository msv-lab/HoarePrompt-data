Output State: **`i` is 0, `pos` is 1, `z_l` is 1**

Explanation: The line `z_l += 1` increments the value of `z_l` by 1. Given that `z_l` was initially not specified in the initial state, we assume it was 0 before this operation. After executing the line, `z_l` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `pos` remain unchanged.
