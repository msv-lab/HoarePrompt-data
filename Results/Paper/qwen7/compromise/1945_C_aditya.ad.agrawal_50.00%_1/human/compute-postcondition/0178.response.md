Output State: **All elements in `arr` have been processed, `pos` equals the length of `arr` + 1, `z_l` and `z_r` are both 0, `o_l` equals the total number of 1s in `arr`, `o_r` equals the total number of -1s in `arr`, `b_d` equals `abs(n / 2 - len(arr))`, and `ans` equals the last position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` was satisfied, or remains 0 if no such position existed.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- `pos` will be equal to the length of `arr` + 1 because every element in `arr` has been processed, and `pos` increments with each iteration.
- Both `z_l` and `z_r` will be 0 because all zeros in `arr` have been counted and processed.
- `o_l` will be the total number of 1s in `arr` because every 1 in `arr` has been counted.
- `o_r` will be the total number of -1s in `arr` because every 0 in `arr` has been counted and subtracted from `o_r`.
- `b_d` will be `abs(n / 2 - len(arr))` because `pos` will be the length of `arr` + 1 when the loop ends, and `b_d` is calculated based on the distance from `n / 2` to `pos`.
- `ans` will be the last position where the specified condition was met, or it will remain 0 if no such position existed during the loop's execution.
