Postcondition: `arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans` + 1, `o_r` is either 0 or -1, `z_r` is either 0 or 1, and `b_d` is recalculated as `abs(n / 2 - pos)`. If the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true, then `b_d` is updated to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.
