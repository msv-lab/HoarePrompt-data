Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `z = arr.count(0)` counts the number of occurrences of the integer 0 in the list `arr`. This count is stored in the variable `z`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `input_string`) remain unchanged.
