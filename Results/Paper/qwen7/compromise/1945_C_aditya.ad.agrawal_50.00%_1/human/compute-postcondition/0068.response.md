Output State: **`input_string` is a string input by the user, `i` is the last element of the list `arr`, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `-o`, `b_d` remains 3, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` was last satisfied before `pos` reached the length of `arr`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `z_r = z` simply assigns the value of `z` to `z_r`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
