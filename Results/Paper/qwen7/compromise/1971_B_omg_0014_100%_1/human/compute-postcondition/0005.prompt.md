You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines of text, each line being either 'YES' followed by either the lexicographically smallest string or its reverse, or 'NO'. The number of these lines will be equal to the value of `n`. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the program reads a string `s` from input. If the string `s` contains all unique characters, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by either the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` or its reverse, whichever comes first when sorted normally.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. The function returns information based on the string `s` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
