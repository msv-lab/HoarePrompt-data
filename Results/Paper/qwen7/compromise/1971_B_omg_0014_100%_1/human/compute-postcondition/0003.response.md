Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines of text, each line being either 'YES' followed by either the lexicographically smallest string or its reverse, or 'NO'. The number of these lines will be equal to the value of `n`. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `n-1`, the program reads a string `s` from input. If the string `s` contains all unique characters, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by either the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` or its reverse, whichever comes first when sorted normally.
