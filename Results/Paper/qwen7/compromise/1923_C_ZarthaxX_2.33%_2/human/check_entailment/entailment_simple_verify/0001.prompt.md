You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to determine if a subarray \(c_{l_i}, c_{l_i+1}, \dots, c_{r_i}\) is "good".
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another array \(b\) of the same length such that:
     1. The sums of elements in both arrays are equal.
     2. No element in \(a\) is equal to the corresponding element in \(b\).
     3. All elements in \(b\) are positive.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the subarray contains only 1s, it cannot be good because we cannot find another array \(b\) where all elements are positive and different from the original.
   - For a subarray to be good, it must contain at least one element greater than 1. This allows us to create a new array \(b\) where we replace some 1s with other positive numbers while keeping the sum the same.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process each test case.
   - It calculates the number of 1s (`ones`) and the adjusted sum (`sum`) up to each index.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray can be good by comparing the number of 1s and the adjusted sum within the specified range.

4. **Specific Issues**:
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to be checking if the subarray can be good by comparing the number of 1s and the adjusted sum. However, the logic is flawed.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` does not correctly determine if the subarray can be good. Instead, it should check if the subarray has enough flexibility to replace some 1s with other positive numbers without violating the conditions.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly determine if a subarray is good, we need to check if the subarray contains at least one element greater than 1 and if the sum of the subarray is even (since we can pair elements to make them different).

6. **Corrected Logic**:
   - Check if the subarray contains at least one element greater than 1.
   - Check if the sum of the subarray is even.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
