Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( q \), a list \( c \) of \( n \) positive integers, and \( q \) queries. Each query includes two positive integers \( l_i \) and \( r_i \). For each query, the function calculates whether the sum of elements in the subarray from index \( l_i \) to \( r_i \) can be made non-negative by flipping at most one 0 to 1 in the subarray. If such a flip can achieve a non-negative sum, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries, the function concludes without returning any value.**
