Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two positive integers `l_i` and `r_i`. The function returns the result of processing these inputs, which could be a list of answers for each query or a specific value based on the problem's requirements.**
