Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing operations where we can choose a subarray and set all elements in that subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
   - We can perform up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Functions Provided**:
   - `func_1(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> int`: This function seems to be intended to calculate the maximum possible sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`. However, the logic within this function is complex and recursive, and it does not directly solve the problem as stated.
   - `func_2(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]`: This function is supposed to find the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. However, it also uses recursion and does not seem to correctly implement the logic for finding the optimal operations.
   - `make_stairs(i: int) -> None`: This function is intended to create a "staircase" pattern in the array, but it is called recursively without proper context and does not seem to be used correctly.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - **Incorrect Approach**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. They do not directly address the MEX value calculation and the operations needed to maximize the sum.
   - **Recursive Overhead**: Both `func_1` and `func_2` use recursion, which is inefficient and may lead to stack overflow for large inputs.
   - **Lack of Clear Logic**: The logic within these functions is unclear and does not align with the problem statement. For example, `func_1` attempts to calculate the maximum sum using a divide-and-conquer approach, but it does not consider the MEX value properly.
   - **Missing Implementation**: The `make_stairs` function is not used correctly and does not contribute to solving the problem as intended.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
