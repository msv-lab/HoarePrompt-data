Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations where we can choose a subarray and set all its elements to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray. The solution must use no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` using dynamic programming with memoization. It correctly handles the base cases and recursive calls to explore all possible subarrays.
   - **func_2**: This function finds the subarray that gives the maximum possible sum and constructs the sequence of operations needed to achieve this sum. It correctly identifies the subarray and recursively breaks down the problem into smaller subproblems.
   - **make_stairs**: This function is called when a subarray is found that needs to be modified to achieve the desired sum. It ensures that the subarray is set to the required MEX value. However, the logic in `make_stairs` seems incomplete and may not fully address the problem requirements. Specifically, the function does not handle the case where the subarray already meets the condition, and it does not return the correct operations.

Given the detailed analysis, the primary issue lies in the `make_stairs` function, which is crucial for constructing the operations. The function should correctly identify the subarray that needs modification and apply the necessary operations to set the elements to the MEX value. However, the current implementation does not fully address this requirement.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the issue, the `make_stairs` function needs to be revised to correctly handle the construction of operations. Specifically, it should:
- Identify the subarray that needs modification.
- Set the elements of the subarray to the MEX value.
- Return the sequence of operations needed to achieve this.
