### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided code and the problem description step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing operations where we can choose a subarray and set all elements in that subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
- We can perform up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

#### Functions Provided Recap:
1. **`func_1(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> int`**:
   - This function is intended to calculate the maximum possible sum for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - However, the logic within this function is complex and recursive, and it does not directly solve the problem as stated.
   - The function uses memoization (`res_dict`) to store intermediate results, but the core logic does not align with the problem requirements.

2. **`func_2(start_index: int, end_index: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]`**:
   - This function is supposed to find the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It uses recursion and does not seem to correctly implement the logic for finding the optimal operations.
   - The function attempts to split the subarray into smaller subarrays and find the maximum sum, but it does not handle the MEX value properly.

3. **`make_stairs(i: int) -> None`**:
   - This function is intended to create a "staircase" pattern in the array, but it is called recursively without proper context and does not seem to be used correctly.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Approach**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. They do not directly address the MEX value calculation and the operations needed to maximize the sum.
   - The logic within these functions is unclear and does not align with the problem statement.

2. **Recursive Overhead**:
   - Both `func_1` and `func_2` use recursion, which is inefficient and may lead to stack overflow for large inputs.

3. **Lack of Clear Logic**:
   - The logic within these functions is unclear and does not align with the problem requirements. For example, `func_1` attempts to calculate the maximum sum using a divide-and-conquer approach, but it does not consider the MEX value properly.
   - The `make_stairs` function is not used correctly and does not contribute to solving the problem as intended.

#### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the MEX value for any given subarray.
2. Perform operations to set the subarray to the MEX value.
3. Ensure the operations do not exceed \(5 \times 10^5\).

A correct solution would involve:
- Iterating through the array and calculating the MEX value for each possible subarray.
- Using a greedy approach to maximize the sum by setting subarrays to their MEX values.

#### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
