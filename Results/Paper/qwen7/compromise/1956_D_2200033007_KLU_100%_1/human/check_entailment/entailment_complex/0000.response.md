Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of that subarray. The operations are limited to 5 * 10^5.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function computes the maximum possible sum of a subarray using dynamic programming and memoization. It correctly handles base cases and recursive calls to explore all possible subarrays.
   - **func_2**: This function finds the subarray that gives the maximum sum as computed by `func_1`. It correctly identifies the subarray and returns the necessary operations. However, the logic for constructing the operations seems incomplete and might not cover all cases.
   - **make_stairs**: This function ensures that the elements in a specified range match their indices. It correctly modifies the array and records the operations. However, it is called only when `func_2` fails to provide the exact solution, which might not be optimal.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - **func_2** might not always provide the correct operations. For example, it does not explicitly handle the case where the entire array needs to be set to the same value to maximize the sum.
   - **make_stairs** is only called when other methods fail, which might not be the most efficient way to solve the problem.

Given the above analysis, while the core logic for finding the maximum sum is correct, the method for constructing the operations might not always produce the correct sequence of operations. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed without further validation.

Correctness: **False**
