Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is `False`, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer, `i` is equal to `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called with the argument `i - 1`. This does not modify the values of `is_already_stairs`, `arr`, `start_index`, or the specific value of `arr[start_index + i]`. It only changes the value of `i` to `i - 1`. All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
