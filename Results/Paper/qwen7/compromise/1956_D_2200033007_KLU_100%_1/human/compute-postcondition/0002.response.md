Output State: `is_already_stairs` is False.

Explanation: The loop sets `is_already_stairs` to `False` if any element in the specified range of `arr` does not match the index `j`. Since the loop will check every element in the range `start_index + j` for `j` from `0` to `i`, if any element does not match, `is_already_stairs` will be set to `False`. Given that the initial state of `is_already_stairs` is `True`, it will only remain `True` if all elements in the range match their respective indices. Otherwise, it will be set to `False` after the first mismatch.
