Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it correctly reads the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Computation of Minimum Costs (`c`)**:
   - The program calculates `c[i]` as `min(a[i], b[i])` for each `i` in the range `n`. This step is correct and ensures that `c` contains the minimum cost for each position `i`.

3. **Suffix Sum Calculation (`suff`)**:
   - The program computes the suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1`. This is done correctly using a reverse loop.

4. **Finding the Minimum Cost**:
   - The program iterates through the first `k` positions and calculates the cost `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for each `i` in the range `k`. It keeps track of the minimum cost encountered.
   - The logic for finding the minimum cost is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost found, which is the correct output as per the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue.

Correctness: **True**
