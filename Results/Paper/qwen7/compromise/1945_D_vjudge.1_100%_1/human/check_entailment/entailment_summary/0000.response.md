Reasoning:

1. The program correctly parses the input and calls the function `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
2. In `func_1`, the list `c` is correctly computed as the minimum of corresponding elements in `a` and `b`.
3. The suffix sum list `suff` is also correctly computed, where each element `suff[i]` is the sum of elements in `c` from index `i` to the end of the list.
4. The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity and updated to the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `k`. This ensures that the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `k` positions is calculated.
5. The program prints the result for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the logic described in the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
