Output State: **`c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])` for each `i` in the range `n`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.**

This means that the list `c` is created with elements being the minimum values between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` stay the same as they were in the initial state.
