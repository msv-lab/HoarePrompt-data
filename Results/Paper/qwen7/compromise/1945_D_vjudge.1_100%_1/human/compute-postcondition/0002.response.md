Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is set to `n-1` initially (since the loop starts from `n-1` and goes down to `0`).
   - `n` is the length of the list `c`.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n-1`, `i` must be initialized to `n-1`.
   - `n` must be a positive integer to ensure that `i` can decrement and eventually reach a value less than `0`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be a positive integer**
