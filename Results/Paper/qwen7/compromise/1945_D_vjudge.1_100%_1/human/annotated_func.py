#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])` for each `i` in the range `n`; `suff` is a list of length `n+1` where each element `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1`.
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the minimum value among `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `k`, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, and `suff` is a list of length `n+1` where each element `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value among a[i] + suff[i + 1] for all i in the range k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of the corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. It then computes a suffix sum list `suff` where each element `suff[i]` represents the sum of elements in `c` from index `i` to the end of the list. Finally, it finds and returns the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `k`.
