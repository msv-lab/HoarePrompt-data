Functionality: **The function accepts a list of two lists, where the first list contains non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the initial problems, and the second list contains non-decreasing integers representing the expected maximum difficulties. After sorting both lists in non-increasing order, it returns a new list of two lists with the same structure.**
