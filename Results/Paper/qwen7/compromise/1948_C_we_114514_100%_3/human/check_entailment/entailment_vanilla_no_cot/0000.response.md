Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Arrow Movements**: The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the robot's movement based on the arrows. It only checks if certain conditions are met without actually simulating the robot's path.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. For instance, it incorrectly assumes that if an arrow is pointing left and the corresponding arrow below is also pointing left, the robot cannot reach the target. This is not always true and does not cover all possible scenarios.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The solution does not handle all edge cases, such as when the robot needs to move up or down multiple times to reach the target.

4. **Incomplete Path Simulation**: The function does not simulate the entire path the robot takes, which is necessary to determine if it can reach the target cell (2, n).

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the robot's movement step-by-step based on the arrows in both rows. Here’s a corrected approach:

```python
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    position = (1, 1)  # Start at (1, 1)
    while position != (2, n):
        x, y = position
        if y == 1 and row1[y-1] == '<':  # Move left
            position = (x, y - 1)
        elif y == n and row1[y-1] == '>':  # Move right
            position = (x, y + 1)
        else:
            if row1[y-1] == '<':  # Move left
                position = (x, y - 1)
            else:  # Move right
                position = (x, y + 1)
        
        if x == 2 and position[1] == n:
            return 'Yes'
        elif position[0] == 2 and position[1] != n:
            if row2[position[1]-1] == '<':  # Move left
                position = (x, position[1] - 1)
            else:  # Move right
                position = (x, position[1] + 1)
        
        if position == (1, 1):  # If stuck in loop
            return 'No'
    
    return 'Yes'

def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))

func_2()
```

This approach correctly simulates the robot's movement and checks if it can reach the target cell (2, n).
