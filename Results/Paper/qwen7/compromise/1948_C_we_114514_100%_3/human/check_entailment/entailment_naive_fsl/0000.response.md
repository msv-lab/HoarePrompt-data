Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Movement**: The solution does not simulate the actual movement of the robot step-by-step according to the arrows in the grid. Instead, it makes assumptions about the robot's path based on a simplified condition check.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The solution does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. For example, consider the following grid:
   ```
   >>><
   >><<
   ```
   In this case, the robot can move as follows:
   - Start at (1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).
   However, the solution would incorrectly return 'No' because it checks conditions that do not account for the actual path the robot can take.

3. **Simplified Condition Check**: The condition check `if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<')` is too restrictive and does not cover all valid paths the robot can take.

To illustrate, let's consider the example grid:
```
>>><
><>>
```
- Starting at (1, 1), the robot moves to (1, 2) and then to (2, 2).
- From (2, 2), the robot moves to (2, 3) and then to (1, 3).
- From (1, 3), the robot moves to (1, 4) and then to (2, 4).

This path shows that the robot can indeed reach (2, 4), but the provided solution would incorrectly return 'No'.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
