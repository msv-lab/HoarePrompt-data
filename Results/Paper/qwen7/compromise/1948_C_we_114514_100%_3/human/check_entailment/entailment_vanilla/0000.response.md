Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It checks if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the arrows in `row1` and `row2`.

2. **Key Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`).
   - For each position `i` (where `i` ranges from `0` to `half_n - 2`), it checks if the arrow in `row1` at position `2 * i + 1` is `<` and if the corresponding arrows in `row2` at positions `2 * i` and `2 * i + 2` are also `<`. If this condition is met, it returns `'No'`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the last column in `row1` is `<` and the second last column in `row2` is `<`. If this condition is met, it returns `'No'`.
   - If none of the conditions above are met, it returns `'Yes'`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Check

To determine if the program is correct, let's consider the logic and constraints:

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function only considers specific conditions where the robot cannot reach `(2, n)`. Specifically, it checks if the robot gets stuck in a loop or cannot move forward due to certain configurations of arrows.
   - However, the function does not cover all possible scenarios. For example, it does not check if the robot can navigate through the grid using a combination of left and right movements and down movements.

2. **General Logic**:
   - The function assumes that if the robot encounters a certain pattern (specifically, `<` in `row1` and `<` in `row2` for consecutive cells), it cannot reach `(2, n)`. This is a simplification and may not cover all cases.
   - The function does not account for more complex paths that the robot might take to reach `(2, n)`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The problem states that `n` is even, which means the grid has an even number of columns. This is handled correctly in the function.
   - The function correctly processes the input and outputs the results.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` does not cover all possible scenarios for determining if the robot can reach `(2, n)`. It only checks for specific patterns that may prevent the robot from reaching the target cell. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

**Correctness: **False**
