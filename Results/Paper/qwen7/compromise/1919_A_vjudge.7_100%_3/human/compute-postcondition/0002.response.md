Output State: **The output state will consist of 'Bob' or 'Alice' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the condition `if (a + b) & 1 == 0`. The exact sequence of 'Bob' and 'Alice' depends on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.**

This means that for each pair of integers `(a, b)` entered during the loop's execution, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, 'Bob' will be printed; otherwise, 'Alice' will be printed. The final output state will be the concatenation of all these printed strings.
