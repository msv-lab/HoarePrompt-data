Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in their wallets.
2. The key observation here is that if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. This is because the game essentially reduces the total number of coins by one in each turn, and the player who faces an even total when it's their turn loses.
3. The provided code correctly implements this logic:
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `(a + b) & 1 == 0`.
   - Based on the result, it prints either "Bob" or "Alice".
4. The logic is sound and matches the problem statement perfectly. There are no edge cases or conditions missed in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
