Reasoning:
The provided program logic checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' accordingly. However, we need to verify if this logic correctly determines the winner based on the game rules.

According to the game rules:
- Each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

Let's analyze the game states:
- If a player has 1 coin, they must remove it, leaving them with 0 coins and losing the game.
- If a player has 2 coins, they can remove one coin and force the opponent into a state where they have 1 coin, thus winning the game.
- This pattern continues such that having an odd number of coins always forces the opponent into a losing position if both players play optimally.

Given this analysis:
- If `a + b` is even, both players will eventually end up with 1 coin at some point, leading to a loss for the player whose turn it is.
- If `a + b` is odd, the first player (Alice) can always ensure that she leaves an even number of coins for the second player (Bob), forcing Bob into a losing position.

Therefore, the provided program correctly implements the logic based on the game rules.

Correctness: **True**
