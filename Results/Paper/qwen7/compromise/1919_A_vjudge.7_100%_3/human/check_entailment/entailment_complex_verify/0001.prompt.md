You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The output state will consist of 'Bob' or 'Alice' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the condition `if (a + b) & 1 == 0`. The exact sequence of 'Bob' and 'Alice' depends on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple pairs of non-negative integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\)) from the standard input. For each pair, it checks if their sum is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value but prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' for each input pair.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them, but after any move, they must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins).

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - If a player has more than one coin, they can always force the opponent into a losing position by swapping wallets and removing a coin, ensuring the opponent is left with a smaller number of coins.
   - The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`) determines the winner:
     - If `a + b` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure he wins.
     - If `a + b` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have respectively.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the expression `if a + b & 1 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies whether the sum of coins is even or odd and assigns the winner based on this condition.
   - This matches the optimal strategy explained above.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
