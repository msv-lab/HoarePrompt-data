Output State: **`a` is the next element in the tuple `inp`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, the comparison `x == y` is evaluated but no assignment is made.**

The code `x == y` evaluates whether `x` is equal to `y`. However, since no assignment is made, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states.
