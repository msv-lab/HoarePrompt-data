Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple of integers, `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is \(n + 1\).**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the value of `ans` is set to 0, while the other variables retain their initial states.
