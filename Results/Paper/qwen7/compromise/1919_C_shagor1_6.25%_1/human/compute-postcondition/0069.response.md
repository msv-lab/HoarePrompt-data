Postcondition: `a` is the second element of the tuple `inp`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` and `y` are both \(n + 1\). If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `a` is assigned to `x`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, and `x` equals `y` evaluates to False.
