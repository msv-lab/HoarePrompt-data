Output State: **`a` is the first element of the tuple `inp`, `ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is \(n + 1\), and `x == y` is evaluated to True.**

Explanation: The code `x == y` evaluates whether `x` is equal to `y`. Given that both `x` and `y` are defined as `n + 1`, the condition `x == y` is always true. No variables are updated by this line of code, so the values of `a`, `ans`, `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
