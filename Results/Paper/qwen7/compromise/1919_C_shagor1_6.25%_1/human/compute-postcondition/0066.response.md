Postcondition: `a` is the second element of the tuple `inp`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is `a`. If `a <= y`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `a > y`, then `a` is updated to `y`, `ans` changes to either 1 or 2, and `x == y` evaluates to False.
