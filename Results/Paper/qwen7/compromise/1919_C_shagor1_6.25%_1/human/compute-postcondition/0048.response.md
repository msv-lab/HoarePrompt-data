Output State: **`a` is the first element of the tuple `inp`, `ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is \(n + 1\), and `x` is now equal to `a`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a` assigns the value of `a` to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
