Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is `a`, `y` is \(n + 1\), `ans` is 1 if the next element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `ans` is 0, and `a` is the second element of `inp`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a` assigns the value of `a` to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is now directly `a`, while `y` remains as `n + 1` and `ans` is determined based on the comparison between the next element in `inp` and `x`.
