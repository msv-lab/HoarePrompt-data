Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where it receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. The function processes each test case according to the given constraints and returns a result for each, but the specific result type or content is not detailed here.
