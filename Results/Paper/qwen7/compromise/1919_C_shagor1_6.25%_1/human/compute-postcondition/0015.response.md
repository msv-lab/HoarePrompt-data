Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is now `a`, `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element of `inp`, and `a > y`.**

Explanation: The code `y = a` updates the value of `y` to be equal to `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `a` is specified to be the first element of `inp` and `a > y` (which was originally \(n + 1\)), `y` is now updated to `a`.
