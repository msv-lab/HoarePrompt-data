Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It then finds the smallest and second smallest unique elements in the list and counts how many elements are larger than the second smallest unique element. The function outputs this count for each test case.**
