Postcondition: `a` is the second element of the tuple `inp`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), and `x` and `y` are defined as follows:
- If `a <= x`, then `x` is set to `a`.
- If `a > x`, then `ans` remains unchanged, and `x` is set to `y` if `a` is less than or equal to `y`; otherwise, `ans` becomes either 1 or 2, and `x` equals `y` is evaluated to False.
