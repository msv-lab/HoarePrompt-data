Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences and calculating the penalty for each subsequence.
- The given solution attempts to find the smallest and second smallest unique elements in the array and counts how many elements are larger than the second smallest unique element. This approach is flawed because:
  - The penalty calculation should consider the number of times the order of elements changes within each subsequence, not just the second smallest unique element.
  - The logic for updating `x` and `y` does not correctly handle the penalty calculation for each subsequence.
- The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the penalty for each subsequence. Instead, it only considers one specific aspect of the penalty calculation and ignores the overall structure of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
