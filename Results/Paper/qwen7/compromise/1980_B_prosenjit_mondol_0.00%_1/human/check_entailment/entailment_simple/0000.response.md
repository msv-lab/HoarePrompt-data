### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, including `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a`. The decrement of `f` and `k` by 1 is also correct, as indices in Python start at 0.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list `a` in reverse order, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - If `a[k] > x`, the program prints 'NO'. This is correct because if the value at the `k`-th position after sorting is greater than the value of the favorite cube, the favorite cube cannot be removed.
   - If `a[k] < x`, the program prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the value at the `k`-th position after sorting is less than the value of the favorite cube, the favorite cube must be removed.
   - If `a[k] == x`, the program further checks whether the favorite cube is the last element or if the element before the `k`-th position is smaller than `x`. This logic is correct:
     - If the favorite cube is the last element (`k == n - 1`), it will definitely be removed.
     - If the element before the `k`-th position is smaller than `x`, it means there is another cube with a higher value before the `k`-th position, so the favorite cube might still be removed.
     - Otherwise, the favorite cube might not be removed.

4. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate output ('YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE') for each test case based on the conditions checked.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
