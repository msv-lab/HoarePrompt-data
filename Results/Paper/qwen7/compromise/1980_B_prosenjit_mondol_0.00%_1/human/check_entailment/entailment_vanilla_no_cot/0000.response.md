Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed based on the given conditions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Adjusting Indices**: It adjusts the indices for the favorite cube and the number of removed cubes to be zero-based.
3. **Sorting Cubes**: The program sorts the cubes in non-increasing order of their values.
4. **Comparing Values**: It compares the value of the favorite cube with the value of the k-th cube after sorting.
   - If the value of the k-th cube is greater than the value of the favorite cube, the favorite cube is definitely not removed.
   - If the value of the k-th cube is less than the value of the favorite cube, the favorite cube is definitely removed.
   - If the values are equal, the program checks additional conditions to determine if the favorite cube might still be removed or not.
5. **Outputting Results**: Based on the comparison, it prints "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE" as appropriate.

The program handles all the specified edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the given program is correct.
