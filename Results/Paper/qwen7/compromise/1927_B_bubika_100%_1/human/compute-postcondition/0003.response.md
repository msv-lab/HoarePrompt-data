Output State: **`b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is initially a list of 26 zeros. The code snippet `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The list `b` remains unchanged. Therefore, the list `b` is still a list of 26 zeros, and `n` now holds the integer value input by the user.
