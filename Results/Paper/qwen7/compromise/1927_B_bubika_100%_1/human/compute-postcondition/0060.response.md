Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it also accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a parameter `a`, which is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input parameters according to the given constraints.**
