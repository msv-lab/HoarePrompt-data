Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It is used correctly in the solution to ensure the final result fits within the required constraints.
   - **Correct**: This function is implemented correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray.
   - However, the implementation is flawed. The logic inside the loop is not correctly identifying the maximum sum subarray.
   - Specifically, the logic inside the loop is trying to manage segments and update the maximum segment found so far, but it is not implemented correctly.
   - **Incorrect**: The function `func_2` is not correctly identifying the maximum sum subarray.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is not implemented at all. It is declared but left empty.
   - **Incorrect**: This function is not implemented, which means it cannot be used in the solution.

### Conclusion:
Given that `func_2` and `func_3` are either incorrectly implemented or not implemented at all, the overall solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
