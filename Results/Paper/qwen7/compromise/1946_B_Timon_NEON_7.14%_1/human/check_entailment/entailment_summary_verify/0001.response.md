### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided code based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations.
- Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
- The final sum should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Function Summaries Recap:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Takes a number and returns it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - Used correctly in the solution to ensure the final result fits within the required constraints.
   - **Correct**: This function is implemented correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Declared but not implemented.
   - **Incorrect**: This function is not implemented, which means it cannot be used in the solution.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Accepts an integer `number` representing the sum of an array and a non-negative integer `quantity` representing the number of operations.
   - Initializes `answer` to 0 and returns it after performing some unspecified operations based on `number` and `quantity`.
   - **Incorrect**: This function is not implemented, which means it cannot be used in the solution.

#### Code Analysis:
- The main logic for solving the problem is missing. There is no function that actually performs the operations to maximize the sum of the array.
- The functions `func_2` and `func_3` are not implemented, which means they do not contribute to solving the problem.
- The only implemented function `func_1` is used to ensure the final result is within the required constraints, but it does not solve the core problem.

Given that the core logic to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations is missing, the provided code is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The code is incorrect because it lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem and the functions `func_2` and `func_3` are not implemented.
