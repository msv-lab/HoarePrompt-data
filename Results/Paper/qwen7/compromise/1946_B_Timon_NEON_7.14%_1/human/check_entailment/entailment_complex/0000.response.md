### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array after performing \( k \) operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The key insight is to use the largest possible positive subarray sums to increase the overall sum.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_2**: This function finds the longest contiguous subarray with non-negative elements and returns its sum. It also handles edge cases where the array might not contain any positive elements.
   - **func_1**: This function simply returns the remainder of the given number when divided by \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - **func_3**: This function is never called in the provided code, so it doesn't affect the correctness of the solution.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is in the loop that processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum of a non-negative subarray.
   - It then calculates the new sum using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` to get the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies the longest non-negative subarray and returns its sum.
   - The formula used in the main loop is correct for maximizing the sum after \( k \) operations.
   - The modulo operation in `func_1` ensures the result fits within the required bounds.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
