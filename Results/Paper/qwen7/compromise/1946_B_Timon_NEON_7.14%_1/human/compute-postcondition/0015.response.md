Postcondition: **`max_sum` is the sum of the longest contiguous subarray with non-negative elements, `arr` is the original list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the subarray with the maximum sum of non-negative elements and its ending index, `segments_variants` is a list of subarrays that have sums greater than or equal to `max_sum`, and `total_max_segment` is now [-1] if the length of `total_max_segment` is 1; otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.**
