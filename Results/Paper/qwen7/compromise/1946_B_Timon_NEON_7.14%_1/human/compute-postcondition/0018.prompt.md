You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])

    #State: Output State: `max_sum` is the sum of the longest contiguous subarray with non-negative elements, `arr` is the original list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the subarray with the maximum sum of non-negative elements and its ending index, `segments_variants` is a list of subarrays that have sums greater than or equal to `max_sum`.

    #State: Output State: `max_sum` is the sum of the longest contiguous subarray with non-negative elements, `arr` is the original list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the subarray with the maximum sum of non-negative elements and its ending index, `segments_variants` is a list of subarrays that have sums greater than or equal to `max_sum`, `total_max_segment` is the subarray with the maximum starting index among all subarrays in `segments_variants`.
    if (len(total_max_segment) == 1) :
        total_max_segment = [-1]
    #State: `max_sum` is the sum of the longest contiguous subarray with non-negative elements, `arr` is the original list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the subarray with the maximum sum of non-negative elements and its ending index, `segments_variants` is a list of subarrays that have sums greater than or equal to `max_sum`, and `total_max_segment` is now [-1] if the length of `total_max_segment` is 1; otherwise, `total_max_segment` remains unchanged.
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns total_max_segment which is either [-1] if the length of total_max_segment is 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns `total_max_segment`. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, it returns \([-1]\); otherwise, it returns `total_max_segment` unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns total_max_segment which is either [-1] if the length of total_max_segment is 1; otherwise, it remains unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
