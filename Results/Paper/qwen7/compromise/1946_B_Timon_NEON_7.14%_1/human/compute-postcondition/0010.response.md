Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `segment` from the `segments_variants` list.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `segments_variants`. Each element in `segments_variants` is a subarray that has a sum greater than or equal to `max_sum`.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: We need to ensure that `segments_variants` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. Additionally, since the loop iterates over each `segment` in `segments_variants`, we need to ensure that `segments_variants` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `segments_variants` must contain at least one subarray. Since `segments_variants` now includes `max_segment + [len(arr) - 1]`, this ensures that `segments_variants` is not empty.
   - The initial value of `max_sum` and `arr` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, but they are part of the context. The important thing is that `segments_variants` must have at least one element.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are related to ensuring that `segments_variants` is not empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`segments_variants` must contain at least one subarray**
