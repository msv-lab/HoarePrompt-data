Output State: **`i` is 3; `ans[4]` is less than or equal to `arr[4]`; `ans[5]` is equal to `ans[4] + ans[3]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 3, `ans[i + 1]` becomes `ans[4 + 1]` which is `ans[5]`. Since `ans[4]` is less than or equal to `arr[4]`, the new value of `ans[5]` will be `ans[4] + ans[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
