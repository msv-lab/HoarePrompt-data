Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 6.
   - `n` is the length of `arr` plus one.
   - `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`.
   - `ans[8]` is `ans[7] + ans[6]`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `ans[i + 1]` must be less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - Given `i` is 6, the condition becomes `ans[7] <= arr[7]`.

4. **Check the Current Values**:
   - From the given states, `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`.
   - Therefore, the condition `ans[7] <= arr[7]` translates to `arr[6] + ans[6] <= arr[7]`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `arr[7]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[6] + ans[6]`.

Given these steps, the states that need to be adjusted are `arr[7]` to ensure it meets the loop condition.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 6; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one; `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`; `ans[8]` is `ans[7] + ans[6]`; `arr[7]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[6] + ans[6]`**
