Output State: **`i` is 6; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one; `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`; `ans[8]` is `ans[7] + ans[6]`**

Explanation: The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding `ans[i]` to it. Given that `i` is 6, `i + 1` becomes 7, so `ans[7]` is updated to be `ans[6] + ans[6]`. Then, since the next index is `i + 2`, which is 8, `ans[8]` is updated to be `ans[7] + ans[6]`, which is `(ans[6] + ans[6]) + ans[6]` or `2 * ans[6] + ans[6]` or `3 * ans[6]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
