Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `ans[n - 1]` is `2^(n - 1) * arr[0]`, `n` is the length of `arr` plus one, `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]` updates the value of `ans[-1]` based on the previous value of `ans[-2]` and the last element of the array `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `i` remains `n - 2` as it was not affected by this line of code. The value of `ans[n - 1]` remains `2^(n - 1) * arr[0]` as it was calculated in the previous iterations of the loop. The value of `n` remains the length of `arr` plus one, as it was not modified by this line of code.
