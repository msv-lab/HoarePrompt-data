Output State: `i` is 8, `ans[9]` is `4 * ans[8]`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` and update `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` exceeds `arr[i + 1]`. After the third iteration, `i` is 8 and `ans[9]` is `2 * ans[8]`. Since `ans[9]` is doubled each iteration, after the fourth iteration, `ans[9]` will be `4 * ans[8]`. The loop will terminate because `ans[9]` will no longer satisfy the condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` if `arr[9]` does not increase accordingly. Therefore, the final state is `i` is 8 and `ans[9]` is `4 * ans[8]`.
