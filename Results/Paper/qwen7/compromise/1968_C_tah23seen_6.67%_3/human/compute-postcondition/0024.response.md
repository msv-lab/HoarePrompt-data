Output State: `i` is 6; `n` is the length of `arr` plus one; `ans[7]` is `arr[6] + ans[6]`; `ans[8]` is `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6])`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` remains 6 because the loop increments `i + 1` each time it runs, but `i` itself does not change within the loop. The variable `n` remains as the length of `arr` plus one, as it is not affected by the loop. The key changes occur in the `ans` array:

- Initially, `ans[7]` is set to `arr[6] + ans[6]`.
- In the first iteration, `ans[8]` is set to `ans[7] + ans[6]`.
- In the second iteration, since `arr[7]` is already greater than or equal to `arr[6] + ans[6]`, `ans[8]` gets updated to `ans[7] + ans[7]`, which simplifies to `2 * (arr[6] + ans[6])`.

Since the loop condition `ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` is no longer met after the third iteration, the loop terminates. Therefore, the final state of `ans` after all iterations is `ans[7] = arr[6] + ans[6]` and `ans[8] = 2 * (arr[6] + ans[6])`.
