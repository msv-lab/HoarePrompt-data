Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the function `func_1` generates an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, we need to check if the generated array `ans` meets the requirement that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).

Let's analyze the logic of the function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - For subsequent elements, `ans[i+1]` is calculated as `arr[i] + ans[i]`, ensuring that `ans[i+1] > arr[i+1]`.

2. **Adjustment Loop**:
   - If `ans[i+1]` is less than `arr[i+1]`, it enters a loop where `ans[i+1]` is incremented by `ans[i]` until `ans[i+1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i+1]`.

3. **Final Element**:
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

Now, let's see if these steps ensure that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \):

- For \( i = 2 \): 
  - \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = (arr[0] + 1 + arr[0]) \bmod (arr[0] + 1) = arr[0] + 1 \bmod (arr[0] + 1) = arr[0] \).
  - This matches the condition since \( x_2 = arr[0] \).

- For \( i = 3 \):
  - \( a_3 \bmod a_2 = (arr[0] + 1 + arr[0] + arr[0] + 1) \bmod (arr[0] + 1 + arr[0]) = (2 \cdot arr[0] + 2) \bmod (2 \cdot arr[0] + 1) = 1 \).
  - This matches the condition since \( x_3 = 1 \).

- For general \( i \):
  - The pattern continues, and the modulo operation will always yield the correct value due to the construction of `ans`.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly constructs an array `ans` that satisfies the required conditions.

Correctness: **True**
