Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. For each set of digits, it checks if they form a stair (`a < b < c`) or a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
5. The conditions for checking "STAIR" and "PEAK" are implemented correctly according to the problem statement.
6. The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem description.

Given this analysis, the provided program logic is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
