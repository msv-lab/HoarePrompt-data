Postcondition: `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, and 5, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 1. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` is updated to contain -1, -1, and 5. Otherwise, `last` remains as [-1, -1, -1].
