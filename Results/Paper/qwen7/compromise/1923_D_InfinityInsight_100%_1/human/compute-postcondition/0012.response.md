Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2.
   - `last` is a list containing -1 and possibly another -1 or 2.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1.
   - `i` is either 2 or 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `left` contains 2 and `last` contains 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` contains -1 and `i` is 2.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is either 2 or 3, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
     - If `i` was 2, it becomes 3.
     - If `i` was 3, it becomes 4 (but since the loop condition is `i < n`, `i` cannot be 4 because `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` would exceed the range).
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the states based on the new value of `i`**:
   - If `i` was 2, it becomes 3.
   - If `i` was 3, it cannot proceed further as the loop condition would fail (`i < n`).

Given these steps, let's update the states:

- If `i` was 2, it becomes 3.
- `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1 and possibly another -1 or 2, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1.**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1 and possibly another -1 or 2, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**
