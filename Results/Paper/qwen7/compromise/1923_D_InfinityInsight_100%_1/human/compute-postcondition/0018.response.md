Output State: **`left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, and 5, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 5.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 5) to the list `last`. The initial state of `last` is a list containing -1 and -1. After appending 5, `last` becomes a list containing -1, -1, and 5. The values of `left`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
