Postcondition: `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1 and possibly another -1 or 2, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` must be greater than 1, and if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `left` contains 2 and `last` contains 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i - 1]`, then `last` contains -1 and `i` is 2.
