Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is `n-1`; `inx2` is the value of `last[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `last[i - 1]` to `inx2`. Since `i` is `n-1`, `i - 1` is `n-2`. Therefore, `inx2` now holds the value of `last[n-2]`. The values of `ans`, `i`, and `inx` remain unchanged.
