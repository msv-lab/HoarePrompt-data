Output State: **`left` is a list containing either 0 or 2 with the new element being the previous last element plus `i`; `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`; `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1; `i` is `n`; `a` must be a non-empty list; `n` must be greater than 1.**

In more detail:
- The `left` list appends a new element which is the sum of its last element and `i`. Since `i` is `n`, and `n` is greater than 1, the new element appended to `left` is `left[-1] + n`.
- All other variables remain unchanged: `last` remains as a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`; `ans` remains a list of length `n` containing -1; `i` remains `n`; `a` remains a non-empty list; `n` remains greater than 1.
