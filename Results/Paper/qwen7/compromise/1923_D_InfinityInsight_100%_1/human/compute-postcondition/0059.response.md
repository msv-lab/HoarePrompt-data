Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` is 4 - `inx2`, and `ans[4]` is 1; `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)` and `x` is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of `func_1(left, x)` to the variable `inx`. However, the function `func_1` is not defined, so we cannot determine the exact value of `inx`. The values of `ans` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
