Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. The variable `i` takes on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the first element of `a`. For the next iteration, `i` will be the second element of `a`.
   - **`a`**: Since `i` is taken from `a`, and `a` is a non-empty list, for the next iteration, `a` remains the same as it was before the loop started (assuming the list `a` does not change within the loop body).

4. **Other Variables**:
   - **`left`**: The problem statement mentions that `left` is updated by appending the value of the last element of `left` plus `i`. However, since we are only adjusting the state at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to change `left` here.
   - **`last`**: The state of `last` is not directly affected by the loop, so it remains unchanged.
   - **`ans`**: The state of `ans` is not directly affected by the loop, so it remains unchanged.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to the second element of `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`left` is a list containing either 0 or 2 with the new element being the previous last element plus `i`, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is the second element of `a`, `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, and `left` is updated by appending the value of the last element of `left` plus `i`.**
