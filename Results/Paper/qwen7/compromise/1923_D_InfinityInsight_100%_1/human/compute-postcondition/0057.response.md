Postcondition: **`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` is 4 - `inx2`, and `ans[4]` is 1.**

Explanation: Given the precondition and the if part, the postcondition indicates that if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, then `ans[4]` will be set to 1. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change if the condition `a[i] < a[i - 1]` is not met. Therefore, `ans[4]` will always be 1 after the if-else block executes.
