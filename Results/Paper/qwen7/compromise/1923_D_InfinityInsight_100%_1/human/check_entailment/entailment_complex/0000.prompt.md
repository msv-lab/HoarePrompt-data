Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer representing the number of slimes, and a is a list of positive integers where each element a_i represents the size of the i-th slime.
def func_1(a, x):
    if (x < 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    inx = bl(a, x)
    if (a[inx] == x) :
        return inx + 1
        #The program returns the index of the first occurrence of x in the list a plus 1
    #State: Postcondition: `inx` is the index of the first occurrence of `x` in the list `a`, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of slimes, and `a` is a list of positive integers where each element `a_i` represents the size of the i-th slime. Additionally, `a[inx]` is not equal to `x`.
    return inx
    #The program returns the index of the first occurrence of x in the list a.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` and an integer `x`. It searches for the first occurrence of `x` in the list `a`. If `x` is not found, it returns -1. If `x` is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence of `x` in the list `a` plus 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5.
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is a list containing either 0 or 2, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. The `last` list will contain `-1` repeated until the final index, which will be `n-1`, because each time `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]`, `last` appends the current index `i`. The `left` list remains unchanged as it only gets updated under specific conditions that are not met here. The `ans` list remains a list of length `n` filled with -1, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to run through all iterations.
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is a list containing the sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element, `last` is a list containing -1, -1, 5, ..., up to the final index which is `n-1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, `i` is 0 (since `i` will be set to 0 after the loop ends), `a` must be a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, and `left` is updated by appending the value of the last element of `left` plus `i` for each iteration.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be set to 0 since it starts from `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `left` list will contain the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element because the loop appends the sum of the last element of `left` and the current element `i` in each iteration. The `last` list will still contain `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`, and `ans` will remain a list of length `n` filled with -1.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is 0; `left` contains the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element; `last` still contains `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`; `a` is a non-empty list; `n` is greater than 1; `inx` remains unchanged.

    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be set to 0 since it starts from `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `left` list will contain the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element because the loop appends the sum of the last element of `left` and the current element `i` for each iteration. The `last` list will still contain `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`, and `ans` will remain a list of length `n` filled with -1, except for specific indices as described.
    return ans
    #`ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1, except for `ans[2]` which is 1, `ans[3]` which is `4 - inx2`, and `ans[4]` which is 1; `i` is 0; `left` contains the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` starting from the first element; `last` still contains `-1` repeated until the final index which is `n-1`; `a` is a non-empty list; `n` is greater than 1; `inx` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of non-negative integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` with specific values at indices 2, 3, and 4, sets `i` to 0, and calculates the cumulative sum of all elements in `a`. Additionally, it updates two auxiliary lists `left` and `last` to maintain certain states during the process. The original list `a` and integer `n` remain unchanged.
