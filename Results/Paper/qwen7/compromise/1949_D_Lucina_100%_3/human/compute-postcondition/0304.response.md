Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `j` is `n + 2`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If the character at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]` is not '?', then `nx` is the original string of `nx` with the last character of `xx[i][n]` appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'S' concatenated with the original string of `nx`, or "nFx".
