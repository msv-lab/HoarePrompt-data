Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `i` and `j` are valid indices for the list `xx`, and neither `i` nor `j` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is concatenated with the string 'F', making its new value 'F'. The other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
