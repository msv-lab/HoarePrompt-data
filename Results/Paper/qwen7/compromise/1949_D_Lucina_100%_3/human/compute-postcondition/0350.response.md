Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of the string `sb`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'F'. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and `sb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
