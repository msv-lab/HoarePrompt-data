Output State: **`b[j]` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` holds true with the current value of `x[j - 1]` being 'S'.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and the condition involving `x[j - 1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
