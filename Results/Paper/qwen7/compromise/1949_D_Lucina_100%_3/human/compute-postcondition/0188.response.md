Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means the loop will run `n` times.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - The final value of `nx` is determined by concatenating characters from `xx[i][j-1]` for all iterations of the loop, unless `xx[i][j-1]` is '?'.
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', `nx` will be 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, otherwise `nx` will be 'S'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `i` from 1 to `n + 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `n + 1`.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`, as it is the only variable in the loop head.
   - The value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`**
