Output State: **`i` is 3; `sb` is a list containing the integers 1 and 3; `a` is a list of integers where `a[1]` is 0 and the rest remain unchanged; `b` is a list of integers where `b[1]` is 0 and the rest remain unchanged; `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**.

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `sb`. Initially, `sb` contains the integer 1. After appending, `sb` will contain the integers 1 and 3. The values of `i`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
