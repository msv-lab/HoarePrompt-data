Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `a` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `a` will be a list of length ranging from 3 to 25, all containing the value 0.
