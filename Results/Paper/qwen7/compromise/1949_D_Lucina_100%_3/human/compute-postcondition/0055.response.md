Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is increased by 1**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. However, since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]` after the operation. But we know that `j` remains 2 and `n` must still be greater than 0.
