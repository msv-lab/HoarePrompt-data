Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the length of `sa`, `i` will be `n+1`, `n` will be an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` and `b` will be lists of length `n+1`, `xx` will be a list containing all the strings `x` entered during the iterations of the loop, `j` will be equal to `n`, `sa` will be a list containing all integers from 1 to the highest index where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` will be a list containing all integers from 1 to the highest index where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sa.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `sa` is a list containing 1. If the first elements of arrays `a` and `b` are both 0, then `sa` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 24, `sa` is a list containing 1 and 3. If `a[3]` is 0 and `b[3]` is 0, then no changes are made to `sa`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `sa` is a list containing 1, 3, and 4. If `a[4]` equals 0 and `b[4]` equals 0, then no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
