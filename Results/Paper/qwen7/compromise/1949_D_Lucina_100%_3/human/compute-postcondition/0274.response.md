Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - From the given state, `j` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is the original value it started with and is greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `[1, n+1)`. Since `j` is initially set to `n`, the loop will start executing if `n` is at least 1. However, since `n` is specified to be greater than or equal to 3, the loop will definitely execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `j` is within the range `[1, n+1)` when the loop starts. Given that `j` is initially `n` and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` will be valid for the first iteration.
   - No adjustments are needed for `n` since it is already correctly set to its original value and is greater than or equal to 3.

5. **List the states that need adjustment**:
   - `j` should be `n` (since it is the starting point).
   - `n` should be greater than or equal to 3 (as per the given condition).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`j` is `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
