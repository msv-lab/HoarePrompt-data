Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`, the value at `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is `nx` plus the value at `xx[i][j - 1]`**.

This means that the value of `nx` has been updated by adding the value at `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value. All other variables and the structure of `xx` remain unchanged from the initial state.
