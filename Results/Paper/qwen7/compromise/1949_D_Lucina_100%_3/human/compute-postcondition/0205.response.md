Output State: **`nx` is the original string plus the character `xx[i][j - 1]`, `n` must be at least 1, and `j` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. The precondition that `n` must be at least 1 and `j` is `j + 1` remains unchanged. Therefore, `nx` now includes the additional character from `xx[i][j - 1]`.
