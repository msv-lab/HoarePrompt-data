Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` will be `n+1`, `n` will be an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` and `b` will be lists of length `n+1`, `xx` will be a list containing all the strings `x` entered during the iterations of the loop, `j` will be equal to `n`, `sa` will be a list containing all integers from 1 to the highest index where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` will be a list containing all integers from 1 to the highest index where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. Additionally, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0:
        sb.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `sb` is a list containing the integer 1, `a` is a list of integers where `a[1]` is 0 and the rest remain unchanged, `b` is a list of integers where `b[1]` is 0 and the rest remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3; `sb` is a list containing the integers 1 and 3; `a` is a list of integers where `a[1]` is 0 and the rest remain unchanged; `b` is a list of integers where `b[1]` is 0 and the rest remain unchanged; `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 4, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, and `sb` contains '4'. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0, the condition is met and no changes are needed. If they are not both 0, the condition is not met and no changes are made to `sb`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
