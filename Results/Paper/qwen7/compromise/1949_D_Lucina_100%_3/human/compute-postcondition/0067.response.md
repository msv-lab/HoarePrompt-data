Output State: **`j` is 3; `b[i]` is incremented by 1; `b[j]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The initial state is that `j` is 3 and `b[i]` is incremented by 1. The code snippet `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Since `j` is 3, `b[3]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `b[i]` is incremented by 1 and `b[j]` (which is `b[3]`) is also incremented by 1.
