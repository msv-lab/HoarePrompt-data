Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1 where each element represents the total occurrences of 'F' in the strings read from the input; `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element represents the total occurrences of 'S' in the strings read from the input; `xx` is a list containing all the strings read from the input during the loop executions; `i` is set to `n+1`; `j` is equal to `n`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be set to `n+1` because the loop increments `i` for each iteration and stops when `i` reaches `n+1`. The variable `j` will be equal to `n` as it iterates from 1 to `n` within each loop iteration. The lists `a` and `b` will contain the cumulative counts of 'F' and 'S' respectively across all input strings provided. The list `xx` will contain all the strings read from the input during the loop executions.
