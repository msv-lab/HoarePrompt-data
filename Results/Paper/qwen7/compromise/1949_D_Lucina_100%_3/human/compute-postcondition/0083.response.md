Output State: **`b[i]` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` holds true with the current value of `x[j - 1]` being 'S'.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged from their initial states.
