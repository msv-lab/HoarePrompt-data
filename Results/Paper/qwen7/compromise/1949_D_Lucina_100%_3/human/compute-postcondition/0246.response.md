Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the character at position `j + 1` in `xx[i]` is either not `'?'` or `'?'`, and if either `i` or `j + 1` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the string 'F' to the end of `nx`. Since `nx` was initially a string, appending 'F' to it results in `nx` being 'F'. The other conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
