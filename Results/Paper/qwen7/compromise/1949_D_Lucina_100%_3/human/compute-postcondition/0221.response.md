Based on the initial state provided, `nx` is a string that has been constructed based on the conditions inside the loop for all iterations from 1 to `n`. Since no specific construction logic for `nx` is given, we need to infer that `nx` is likely built up during the loop, but without more details, we can only describe it in general terms.

Given that `nx` is constructed through a loop from 1 to `n`, let's assume that `nx` is built by concatenating some value or string in each iteration. For example, if in each iteration, we append a character or a number, then `nx` would be a string of length `n`.

Since the exact construction logic is not specified, we can only describe `nx` as a string resulting from the loop operations.

Output: **nx (a string constructed through a loop from 1 to n)**
