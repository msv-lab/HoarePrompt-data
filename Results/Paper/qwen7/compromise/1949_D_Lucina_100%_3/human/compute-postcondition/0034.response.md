Postcondition: `a[i]` and `a[j_prev + 1]` are integers. `b[i]` and `b[j_prev + 1]` remain unchanged. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[i]` and `a[j]` are each increased by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is increased by 1, and `b[j_prev + 1]` and `b[i]` are each increased by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', then `b[j]` is increased by 1.
