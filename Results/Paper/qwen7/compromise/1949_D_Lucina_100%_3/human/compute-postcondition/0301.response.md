Postcondition: `nx` is either 'S' + the original string of `nx` or "nFx", `j` is `n + 2`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` characters of `sb` or `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` characters of `sb`, then `nx` is 'S' + the original string of `nx`. Otherwise, `nx` is "nFx".
