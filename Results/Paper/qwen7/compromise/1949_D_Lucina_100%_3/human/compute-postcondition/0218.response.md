Postcondition: `nx` is a string. If the character `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the original string plus the character `xx[i][j-1]`, `n` must be at least 1, and `j` is `j + 1`. If the character `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', then `nx` is the original string plus 'F', `n` must be at least 1, and `j` is `j + 1`.
