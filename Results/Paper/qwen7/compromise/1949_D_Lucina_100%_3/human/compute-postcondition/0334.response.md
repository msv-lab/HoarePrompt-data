Postcondition: `xx` is a 2D list, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j + 1`, and `nx` is the string that was initially concatenated with the value of `xx[i][j]` if it is not '?', or appended with 'S' or 'F' based on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`. After executing the if-else block, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` is further appended with 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is appended with 'F'.
