Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body sets the value of `nx` based on the conditions provided. However, for the purpose of adjusting the state, we only need to focus on the variables `j` and `n` because they are the only ones that change within the loop head.

3. **Determine the New Values for `j` and `n`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value (which is 1). Therefore, `j` will become 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

4. **Construct the New State**: Based on the above analysis, the new state should reflect the updated values of `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2**
