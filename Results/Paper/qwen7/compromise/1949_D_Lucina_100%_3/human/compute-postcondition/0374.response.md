Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `nx` is a string of length `n` constructed as follows: for each index `i` from 1 to `n`, `nx` concatenates characters from `xx[i][j-1]` for all `j` from 1 to `n`. If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', `nx` appends 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`, otherwise it appends 'S'. If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', `nx` simply appends the character from `xx[i][j-1]`. Additionally, `i` is `n+1`, `sb` contains all integers from 1 to `n`, `a` and `b` are lists of zeros from index 1 to `n+1`, `n` is the original value it started with (greater than or equal to 3), `xx` is an empty list, `j` is `n`, and `sa` is an empty list.**
