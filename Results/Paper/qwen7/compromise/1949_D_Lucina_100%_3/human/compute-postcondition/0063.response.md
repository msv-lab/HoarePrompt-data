Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - The condition for the loop is `j in range(1, n + 1)`

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Current Value of `j`:**
   - From the initial state, `j` is currently 2.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently 2, the next value of `j` would be 3 if the loop continues.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to update `j` to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`j` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0**
