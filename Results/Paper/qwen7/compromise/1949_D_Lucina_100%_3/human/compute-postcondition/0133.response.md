Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), `a` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `b` is a list of length \(n + 1\), `xx` is a list containing all the strings `x` entered during the iterations of the loop, `j` is equal to `n`, `sa` is a list containing `1`, `3`, and possibly `4`; `sb` is a list containing the element `1`, `3`, and `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `sb`. Initially, `sb` contains `[1, 3]`. After appending `i`, `sb` becomes `[1, 3, 3]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
