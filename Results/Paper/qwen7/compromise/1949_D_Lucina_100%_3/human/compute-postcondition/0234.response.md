Postcondition: `nx` is a string, either 'F' or 'S', `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If either `i` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. If the character at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'F' or 'S' based on the above conditions.
