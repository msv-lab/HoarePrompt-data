Output State: **`b[j]` is increased by 1, `b[i]` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `b[i]` is increased by 1. The code snippet `b[j] += 1` increases the value of `b[j]` by 1. Since no other changes are made to `b[i]` or any other variables, the only updates are that both `b[i]` and `b[j]` have been increased by 1.
