Postcondition: `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3. If `xx[i][2]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'S' or 'F' plus `xx[i][2]`. Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is found in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sb`, then no further changes are made. Otherwise, no additional changes are made to these variables.
