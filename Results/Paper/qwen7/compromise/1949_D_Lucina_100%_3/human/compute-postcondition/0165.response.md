Output State: **`xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `i` is an index within the range of `xx`, and `j - 1` is an index within the range of `xx[i]`, additionally `i` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `j` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is a string with an additional character 'S' appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
