Output State: **`nx` is 'S' followed by the original string value of `nx`, and `j` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. This operation changes the value of `nx` to be the original value of `nx` followed by 'S'. Additionally, the variable `j` is incremented by 1. The conditions regarding `i` and `sa` remain unchanged, and `n` must still be at least 1.
