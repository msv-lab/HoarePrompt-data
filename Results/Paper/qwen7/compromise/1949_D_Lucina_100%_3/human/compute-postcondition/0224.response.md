Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `nx` is an empty string.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1` (inclusive).

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be at least 1 because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`.
   - When `n` is 1, the loop will run once with `j` being 1.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop depends on `n`, we need to ensure `n` is at least 1.
   - The variable `i` is not used in the loop itself, but since it is given as `n + 1`, we can keep it as is unless it affects the loop's execution directly.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `n + 1`, which is consistent with the given state.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**.
