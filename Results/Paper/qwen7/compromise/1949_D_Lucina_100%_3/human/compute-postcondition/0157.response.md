Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially 1.
   - `n` must be a positive integer.
   - `nx` is an empty string.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n`).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1, we don't need to adjust `j` because it is initialized within the loop.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer, as the loop requires `n` to be at least 1.

5. **Final state adjustment**: The state of `nx` does not affect the loop execution, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be a positive integer.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer, `nx` is an empty string**
