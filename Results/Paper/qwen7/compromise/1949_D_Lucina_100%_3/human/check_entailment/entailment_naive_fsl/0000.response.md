Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the transition video plan according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that no matter in which order the player approaches the scenarios, they will never see more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
5

.??F?

.?S??

F??.?

??S.?

????.
```

The output generated by the program is:

```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFS.F
FFFF.
```

Let's check the sequence of transition videos for the permutation \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\):

- From 1 to 2: F
- From 2 to 3: S
- From 3 to 4: S
- From 4 to 5: F

The sequence of transition videos is `FSSF`. Here, there are two consecutive scary (`S`) videos, which is within the limit of \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\). However, let's consider another permutation, say \(5, 4, 3, 2, 1\):

- From 5 to 4: F
- From 4 to 3: S
- From 3 to 2: S
- From 2 to 1: F

The sequence of transition videos is `FSSF`, which again has two consecutive scary (`S`) videos. 

However, if we consider the permutation \(1, 3, 5, 2, 4\):

- From 1 to 3: S
- From 3 to 5: F
- From 5 to 2: S
- From 2 to 4: F

The sequence of transition videos is `SSF F`. Here, there are three consecutive scary (`S`) videos, which violates the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) consecutive videos of the same type.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirement for certain permutations of the scenarios, making it incorrect.
