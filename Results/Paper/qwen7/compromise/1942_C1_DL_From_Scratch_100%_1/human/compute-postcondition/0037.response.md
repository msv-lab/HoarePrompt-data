Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: From the given state, `i` is initially set to `x - 2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `x - 1`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `x - 1`. Given that `i` is initially `x - 2`, the loop will run exactly once because `x - 2 < x - 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will execute, we need to ensure that `i` is correctly set to `x - 2` and that the loop condition is satisfied.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `x - 2`**
