Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `list0`. The values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
