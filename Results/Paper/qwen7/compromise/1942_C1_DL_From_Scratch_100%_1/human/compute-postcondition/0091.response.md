Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

- For each test case, the function checks if the integer `n` is within the range [1, 10^4], `x` is within the range [4, min(n, 2â‹…10^5)], and `y` is 0.
- It then verifies if the x distinct integers provided are within the range [1, n].
- Based on these conditions, the function returns a specific result for each test case.
