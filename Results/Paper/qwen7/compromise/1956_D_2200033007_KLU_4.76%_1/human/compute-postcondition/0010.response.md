Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `c` where the length of the list is between 1 and 18 (inclusive), and each element in the list is between 0 and 10^7 (inclusive). It prints one of two messages based on the length of the list: "4 1" if the length is exactly 2, or "13 0" otherwise. After executing the print statements, the function ends without returning any value.**
