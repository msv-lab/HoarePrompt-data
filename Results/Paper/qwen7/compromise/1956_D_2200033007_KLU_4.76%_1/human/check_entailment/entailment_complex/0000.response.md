Reasoning:
- The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in the array using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
- The annotated program does not actually implement the logic to solve the problem. Instead, it has a hardcoded function `func_1` that prints results based on the length of the input list `c`.
- For `n = 2`, it correctly prints `4 1` and `1 2`, indicating that the operation sets both elements to 2, achieving a sum of 4.
- For `n > 2`, it prints `13 0`, which is also correct because for any array of length greater than 2, the maximum sum can be achieved without any operations, as the initial sum is already the maximum possible sum for the given constraints.
- However, the function does not provide the sequence of operations required to achieve the maximum sum, nor does it handle all possible input lengths and values within the specified constraints.

Given the problem's requirements, the provided function does not meet the criteria of the problem statement. It lacks the necessary logic to dynamically find and apply the optimal operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.

Correctness: **False**
