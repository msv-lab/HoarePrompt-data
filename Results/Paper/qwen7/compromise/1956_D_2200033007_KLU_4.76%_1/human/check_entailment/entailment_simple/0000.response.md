Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not process the input array `a` and does not perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.
2. The function `func_1` is hardcoded to handle only the case when the length of the array `c` is 2. If `c` is not 2, it simply prints `13 0`, which is not a general solution for all possible lengths of the array.
3. For the case when `c` is 2, the program correctly prints `4 1` and `1 2`, but this is only for the specific input `[0, 1]`. It does not account for other possible inputs of length 2.
4. For the case when `c` is not 2, the program incorrectly prints `13 0`, which is the maximum sum for the specific input `[1, 3, 9]`. However, this is not a general solution for arrays of different lengths and values.
5. The program does not include the logic to find the maximum sum by performing the allowed operations. It does not compute the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value and update the subarray as specified in the problem description.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
