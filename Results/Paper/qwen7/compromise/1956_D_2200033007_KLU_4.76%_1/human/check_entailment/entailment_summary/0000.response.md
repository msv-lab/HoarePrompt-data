Reasoning:
- The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing specific operations up to \(5 \times 10^5\) times.
- The provided code does not actually implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements. Instead, it hardcodes the output based on the length of the input array.
- For an input array of length 2, the code correctly outputs `4 1` and `1 2`, which means setting both elements to 2 maximizes the sum.
- For arrays of other lengths, the code incorrectly outputs `13 0`, which does not necessarily maximize the sum for those cases.
- Specifically, for an array of length 3 with elements `[1, 3, 9]`, the maximum sum is 13, but the code incorrectly outputs `13 0`.
- For an array of length 4 with elements `[1, 100, 2, 1]`, the maximum sum is achieved by setting all elements to 100, resulting in a sum of 105, but the code outputs `13 0`.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
