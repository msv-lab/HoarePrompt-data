Output State: **`mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `count` is increased by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `arr` is a list of tuples that must not be empty, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code calculates `mod_x_key` as `num % x`. This does not affect any other variables. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
