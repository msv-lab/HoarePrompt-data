Output State: **`count` is 0, `arr` is a non-empty list, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with keys as remainders when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and values as their counts, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with keys as remainders when elements of `arr` are divided by `y` and values as their counts, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. This means that the previous value of `count` (which was the sum of all `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` values and `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` values for each `num` in `arr`) is reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
