Output State: **`count` is increased by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `arr` is a list of tuples that must not be empty, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `mod_x` using the formula `-num % x`. This means that `mod_x` is the remainder when `-num` is divided by `x`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
