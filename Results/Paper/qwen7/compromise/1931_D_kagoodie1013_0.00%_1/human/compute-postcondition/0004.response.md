Output State: **`count` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), results is an empty list, `mod_y_map` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new dictionary `mod_y_map`. This dictionary does not affect the values of the other variables (`count`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `mod_y_map`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
