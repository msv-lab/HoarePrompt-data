Output State: **`count` is 2, `arr` is a non-empty list that does not contain the first element, `num` is the second element in the list, `mod_x_key` is the same as before, `mod_y_key` is the same as before, `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is 1, `mod_y` is `num % y`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % y` to the variable `mod_y`. Since `num` is the second element in the list `arr`, and `y` is a variable whose value is not specified, `mod_y` will be the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`. All other variables remain unchanged.
