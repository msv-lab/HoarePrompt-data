Output State: **`count` is the sum of `next_num % y` + (-next_num % x) + 2 + 1 + 3 + the sum of all `mod_x_key` values from `arr` modulo `x` + the sum of all `mod_y_key` values from `arr` modulo `y`; `arr` is an empty list; `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with all keys from `arr` modulo `y` mapped to their respective counts; `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with all keys from `arr` modulo `x` mapped to their respective counts; `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially defined as a list containing one element (which is the final value of `count`), appending `count` to `results` does not change its content. Therefore, `results` still contains the final value of `count`. All other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
