Output State: **`count` is `num % y` + (-num % x) + 2, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 3, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_x_map` is a dictionary with `mod_x_key` mapped to 1, `mod_x_key` is `num % x`**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` by 1. Since `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` was initially mapped to 2, after executing the code, it becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
