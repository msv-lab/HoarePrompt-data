Output State: **`count` is `num % y`, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % y` to `mod_y`. This updates the value of `mod_y`, but does not affect any other variables. The other variables remain in their initial states as described.
