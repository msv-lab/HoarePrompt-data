Output State: **`count` is `num % y` + (-num % x) + 2, `arr` is a non-empty list with at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2, `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `count` is `num % y`.
- `mod_x` is `-num % x`.
- `mod_y_map` is a dictionary with `mod_y_key` mapped to 2.
- The code updates `count` by adding `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`. Since `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` returns 0 (as `mod_x` is not a key in the map) and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)` returns 2 (as `mod_y` is `mod_y_key`), `count` is updated to `num % y + 0 + 2`, which simplifies to `num % y + 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged.
