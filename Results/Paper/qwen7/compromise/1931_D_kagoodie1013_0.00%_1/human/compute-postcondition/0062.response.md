Output State: **`arr` is an empty list; `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries where keys are the possible remainders when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and `y` respectively, and values are the counts of these remainders; `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` values and `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` values for each `num` in `arr`; `results` is a list containing one element which is the final value of `count`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`. Since `count` is the sum of all `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` values and `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` values for each `num` in `arr`, and `arr` is an empty list, no elements are being processed, meaning `count` remains unchanged from its initial state. Therefore, `results` now contains only one element, which is the final value of `count`. All other variables (`arr`, `mod_x_map`, `mod_y_map`) remain in their initial state since no new data has been added to them.
