Output State: **`results` contains the cumulative sum of `count` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, `arr` is an empty list, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` are dictionaries containing the frequencies of all possible remainders when elements of `arr` are divided by `x` and `y` respectively across all iterations, and `count` is the final sum of all `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` and `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` values for the last iteration.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain a list of all the `count` values computed for each iteration. The `arr` list will be empty since it gets reset at the start of each iteration. The `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries will store the frequency of each remainder for `x` and `y` across all elements processed during the entire loop execution. The `count` variable will hold the final sum of all the counts accumulated from the last iteration of the loop.
