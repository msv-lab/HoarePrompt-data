Output State: **`mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1, `mod_y_key` is updated to `num % y`, `count` is increased by the sum of `mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0)` and `mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)`, `arr` is a list of tuples that must not be empty, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `mod_x` is `-num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `mod_x_map[mod_x_key]` is `mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1`, and `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mod_y_map[mod_y_key]` by incrementing it by 1. It also ensures that `mod_y_key` is updated to `num % y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
