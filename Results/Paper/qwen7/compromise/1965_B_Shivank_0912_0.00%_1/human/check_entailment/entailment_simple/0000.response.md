Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a sequence \(a\) of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence of \(a\) sums to \(k\).
   - For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there exists a subsequence of \(a\) that sums to \(v\).

2. The proposed solution generates a sequence of the first 25 powers of 2: \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).

3. This sequence satisfies the condition that no subsequence sums to \(k\) because \(k\) is a specific value and the sum of any subset of these powers of 2 will either be 0 (if no elements are selected) or a unique combination of these values, which will never equal \(k\) due to the nature of binary representation and the fact that \(k\) is within the range of \(1 \le k \le n\).

4. Furthermore, for any \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), \(v\) can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2 (by its binary representation). Since the sequence includes all necessary powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\), it can represent any number up to \(2^{25} - 1\), ensuring that every possible sum \(v\) can be formed by selecting appropriate elements from the sequence.

Given this analysis, the proposed solution correctly meets the requirements of the problem.
