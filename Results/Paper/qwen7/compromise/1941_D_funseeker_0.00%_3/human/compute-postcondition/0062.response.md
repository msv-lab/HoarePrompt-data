Output State: **`ans` is a set that may contain multiple elements, `temp` is a set that includes a total of \(2 \times \text{number of elements in } ans - 1\) elements, which consist of multiple occurrences of \((q + r) \% n\), one occurrence of \((q - r) \% n\), `q` is the last element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and its current value is either '1' or '?'.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all iterations, `ans` will no longer contain any elements since each element in `ans` is processed exactly once. For each element `q` in `ans`, the loop adds \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\) to `temp`. Since this process repeats for every element in `ans`, `temp` will contain multiple occurrences of \((q + r) \% n\) (specifically, twice the number of elements in `ans` minus one) and one occurrence of \((q - r) \% n\). The values of `q`, `r`, and `c` will be updated to the final values from the last iteration of the loop, with `c` being either '1' or '?'.
