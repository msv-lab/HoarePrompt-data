Output State: **`ans` is a set that must contain at least one element (now including `(q + r) % n`), `temp` is a set that now includes three elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and `(q + r) % n`, `q` is the next element in the set `ans`, `r` is the integer value of the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, and its current value is either '1' or '?'**.

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` already included `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, after adding `(q + r) % n` again, `temp` now contains three elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and `(q + r) % n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
