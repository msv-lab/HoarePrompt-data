Output State: **`ans` contains at least one element, the last element in the set `ans` is `(q + r) % n`, the current value of `c` is either '0' or '?'**.

Explanation: The code adds an element to the set `ans`. The element added is the result of `(q + r) % n`. The last element in the set `ans` before this operation was `q`, and now it is replaced by `(q + r) % n`. The value of `c` remains unchanged and is either '0' or '?'.
