### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The program defines several functions using `lru_cache`, but these are not used in the main function `func_4`. This suggests they might be intended for other purposes, but they are not necessary for solving the current problem. Since they are not used, we can safely ignore them for the purpose of verifying the correctness of `func_4`.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input.
   - `func_2()` converts the read line to an integer.
   - `func_3()` reads a line, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns them as a list.
   - These functions are correctly implemented and used in `func_4` to read the necessary inputs.

3. **Main Function (`func_4`)**:
   - It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction (`0` for clockwise, `1` for counterclockwise, and `?` for either), it updates the set `ans` with the possible new positions of the ball.
   - If the position `0` is in the set, it replaces it with `n` (since index `0` corresponds to `n` in a 0-indexed array).
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible players and the list of those players.

4. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise movements.
   - It correctly accounts for the unknown direction (`?`) by considering both possibilities.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the ball wraps around the circle correctly.
   - The final handling of `0` replacing `n` is correct for 1-based indexing.

5. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_4`. It mentions that the function processes a series of throws among players, updates the set of players who could have the ball after each throw, and finally prints the size of the set and its contents.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function `func_4` accurately follows the steps outlined in the problem statement and the function summary.
