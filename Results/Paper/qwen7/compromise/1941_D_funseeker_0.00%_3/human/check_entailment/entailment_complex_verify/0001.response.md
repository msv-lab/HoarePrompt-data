### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are defined to read and process input. However, these functions are not used within the main function `func_4`. Instead, `func_4` directly calls `func_1` and `func_3` to read and process the input. This suggests that the `lru_cache` decorators and the additional functions are not necessary for the current implementation and might be leftovers from a previous design phase.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input.
   - `func_2()` converts the read line to an integer.
   - `func_3()` reads a line, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns them as a list.
   - In `func_4`, these functions are called directly without caching, which is fine since the input size constraints are manageable.

3. **Main Function (`func_4`)**:
   - It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - Depending on the direction (`0` for clockwise, `1` for counterclockwise, and `?` for either), it updates the set `ans` with the possible new positions of the ball.
   - If the position `0` is in the set, it replaces it with `n` (since index `0` corresponds to `n` in a 0-indexed array).
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible players and the list of those players.

4. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise movements.
   - It correctly accounts for the unknown direction (`?`) by considering both possibilities.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the ball wraps around the circle correctly.
   - The final handling of `0` replacing `n` is correct for 1-based indexing.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the direction is unknown (`?`) by considering both possible directions.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the ball wraps around the circle correctly, even when the direction is unknown.
   - The handling of `0` being replaced by `n` ensures that the 1-based indexing is maintained correctly.

6. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the number of possible players and their indices in increasing order.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. The logic handles all edge cases, including unknown directions and wrapping around the circle. The code is efficient and adheres to the problem constraints.
