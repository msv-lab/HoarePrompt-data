Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input using custom functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) to handle reading a line, an integer, and space-separated integers, respectively.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws**: For each of the `m` throws, it processes the distance `r` and the direction `c`:
   - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it adds the clockwise position `(q + r) % n` to the set.
   - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it adds the counterclockwise position `(q - r) % n` to the set.

4. **Adjusting for Zero Indexing**: After processing all throws, if `0` is in the set, it adjusts it to `n` because the indices should range from `1` to `n`.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of possible players and the list of these players in increasing order.

This approach ensures that all possible positions of the ball are considered based on the given constraints and rules. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.
