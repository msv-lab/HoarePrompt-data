Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is `n // 2`.

3. **Update the state based on the loop conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains `n // 2` because the loop condition does not change `n`.

4. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.
   - Given that `n` is `n // 2`, we need to ensure that `i` (which is now 1) is still less than `n - 1`.

Since `i` is 1 and `n` is `n // 2`, the loop will continue as long as `1 < n - 1`. This condition will hold true as long as `n` is greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` is incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains `n // 2`.
   - The other variables (`zero`, `one`, `s[i]`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`, and `lst`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `n // 2`**
