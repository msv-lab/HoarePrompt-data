Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(n // 2 - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(n // 2 - elem)` value, and `final` is sorted, `c1` is the same as the previous value, `n` is now `n // 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `zero` and `one`, to 0. This does not affect the values of `mini`, `final`, `c1`, `n`, `t`, `o`, or `z`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values and states as described in the initial state.
