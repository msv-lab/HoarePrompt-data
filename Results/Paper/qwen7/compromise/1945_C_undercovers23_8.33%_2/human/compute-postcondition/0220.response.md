Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `lst`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` must contain at least two elements.
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `lst`, at the end of each iteration, `ele` will be set to the next element in `lst`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still contain at least one element.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `mini` will be updated based on the current value of `ele`, but since we don't know the exact value of `ele` or `pk`, we cannot specify an exact value for `mini`. We only need to ensure that `mini` is updated correctly in the loop body.
   - `lst` must contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `lst` contains at least one element, and `mini` is updated accordingly.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**
