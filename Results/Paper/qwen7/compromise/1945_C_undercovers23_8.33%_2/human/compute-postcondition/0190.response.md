Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `n // 2`, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `s[i]` is '0', `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0**

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Given the initial state where `one` is 0, `o` (which is equivalent to `one`) is 0, and `n - i - 1` simplifies to `n - 1` because `i` is 0, the calculation becomes `math.ceil((0 - 0) * 100 / (n - 1))`, which results in `math.ceil(0)`, and thus `one_perc` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
