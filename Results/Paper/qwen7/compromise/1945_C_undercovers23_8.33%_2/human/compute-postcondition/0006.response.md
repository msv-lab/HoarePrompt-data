Output State: **`pk` is `n // 2`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, and the current value of `n` is even.**

Explanation: The code `pk = n // 2` assigns the value of `n` divided by 2 (integer division) to `pk`. Since `n` is specified to be an even integer, `pk` will be `n / 2` rounded down to the nearest integer. The values of `t`, `s`, and the condition about `n` being even remain unchanged.
