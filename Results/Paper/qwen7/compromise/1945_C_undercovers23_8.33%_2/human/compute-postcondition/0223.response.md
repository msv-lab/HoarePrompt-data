Output State: `lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value (which will be the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` encountered during the loop) and `abs(pk - ele)` for each iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `lst` will still contain at least one element, and the variable `mini` will hold the smallest difference (`abs(pk - ele)`) found between `pk` and any element in `lst`.
