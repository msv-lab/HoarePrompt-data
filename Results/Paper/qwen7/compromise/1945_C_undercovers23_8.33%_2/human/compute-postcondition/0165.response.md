Postcondition: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, `final` is either a list containing 0 and sorted elements from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`, or an empty list; `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`, and if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` contains those elements; otherwise, `final` now contains the integer `n`.**
