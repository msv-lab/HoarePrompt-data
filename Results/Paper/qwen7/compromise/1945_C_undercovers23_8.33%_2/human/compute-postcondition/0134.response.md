Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 3, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 1, 2, or 3, `one` is increased by 1, `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, and `lst` is `[3]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50.
