Output State: **`c1` is `o * 100 // n`, `final` is an empty list, contains all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, and `final` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `o * 100 // n` to the variable `c1`. The other variables (`final`, `lst`, `pk`, `mini`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions. The output state includes the new value of `c1` and the unchanged states of the other variables.
