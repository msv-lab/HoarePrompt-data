Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` will be updated during the loop, `final` contains the value of `elem`, `pk - elem` is equal to `mini`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. This does not affect the values of `lst`, `mini`, or the expression `pk - elem`. Therefore, `lst` remains unchanged, `mini` will still be updated during the loop, `final` now contains the value of `elem`, and `pk - elem` is still equal to `mini`.
