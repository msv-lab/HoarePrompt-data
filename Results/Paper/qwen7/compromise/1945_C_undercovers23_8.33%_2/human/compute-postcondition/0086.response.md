Based on the initial state provided:

- `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.
- `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(pk - elem)` value, and `final` is sorted.
- If `len(final) == 0`, then either `mini` contains the smallest value with `final` having one element which is 0 if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or `final` includes the element `n` and `c1` is less than 50.

The `print(final[0])` statement will print the first element of the `final` list.

To determine what this first element is, we need to consider the conditions under which `final` is populated:

1. If `len(final) == 0`, it means no elements in `lst` have the smallest `abs(pk - elem)` value.
2. If `len(final) > 0`, `final` contains elements from `lst` that have the smallest `abs(pk - elem)` value, and it is sorted.

Given these conditions, the precise value of `final[0]` depends on whether `final` is empty or not. Since the exact values of `pk`, `lst`, `c1`, and `n` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `final[0]`. However, we know that if `final` is non-empty, it will contain the smallest element(s) based on the condition `abs(pk - elem)`.

Therefore, the output will be the first element of the `final` list, which is the smallest element among those that satisfy the condition.

Output: **final[0] (the smallest element in final based on the condition abs(pk - elem))**
