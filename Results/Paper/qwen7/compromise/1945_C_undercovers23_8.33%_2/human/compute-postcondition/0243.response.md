Output State: **`c1` is o * 100 // n and greater than or equal to 50, `final` is an empty list with an additional element 0, contains all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, and `final` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(0)` adds the integer `0` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after appending `0`, it now contains the element `0`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
