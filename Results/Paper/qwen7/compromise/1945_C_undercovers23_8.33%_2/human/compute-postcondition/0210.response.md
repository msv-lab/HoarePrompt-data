Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `n // 2`, `zero` is 3, `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 60.0, `one_perc` is 100, `lst` contains `[2]`, `one_perc` is 100**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state includes `i` is 2, `n` is `n // 2`, `zero` is 3, `one` is 2, `zero_perc` is 60.0, `one_perc` is 100, and `lst` contains `[2]`.
2. The code updates `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Here, `o` is not defined, but since `one` is used instead, it's assumed `o` is `one`.
3. Substituting the known values: `one` is 2, `i` is 2, and `n` is `n // 2` (which is not explicitly defined but is part of the initial state).
4. Since `n` is `n // 2`, let's assume `n` was initially some value `x`, so now `n` is `x // 2`.
5. The formula simplifies to `math.ceil((2 - 2) * 100 / (x // 2 - 2 - 1))`, which is `math.ceil(0 * 100 / (x // 2 - 3))`.
6. Since the numerator is 0, the result of the division is 0, and `math.ceil(0)` is 0.
7. However, the initial value of `one_perc` is 100, and no operation changes it unless explicitly stated otherwise.
8. Therefore, `one_perc` remains 100.

Since no other variables are affected, the final output state is as described.
