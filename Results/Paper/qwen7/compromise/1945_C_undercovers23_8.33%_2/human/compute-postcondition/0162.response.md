Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, and `final` is an empty list of sorted elements from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`; `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n`, and `c1` is less than 50.
