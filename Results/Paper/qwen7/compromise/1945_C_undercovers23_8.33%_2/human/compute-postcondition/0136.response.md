Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `ele` and the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `lst`. Since the loop has executed all its iterations, `lst` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the States Based on the Given Information**:
   - From the given information, `lst` will contain `[n-1]` if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50.
   - Therefore, `lst` must contain `[n-1]` for the loop to execute.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element, specifically `[n-1]`.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `lst` contains `[n-1]`.

**State:**
**`lst` contains `[n-1]`**
