Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is 100**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `i` is 4, and since `s[i]` is '0', `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0. The code calculates `zero_perc` as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Substituting the known values, `zero_perc` becomes `math.ceil(1 * 100 / 5)`, which simplifies to `math.ceil(20)`, resulting in `20`. However, since the ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer, `zero_perc` is 100. All other variables remain unchanged.
