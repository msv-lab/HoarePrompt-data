Output State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` will be updated during the loop, `final` now contains the next element in the list `elem`.**

Explanation: The code appends the next element in the list (`elem`) to the `final` list. The initial conditions for `lst`, `mini`, and `elem` remain unchanged except that `final` now includes the value of `elem`.
