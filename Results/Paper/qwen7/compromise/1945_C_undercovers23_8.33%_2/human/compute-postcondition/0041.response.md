Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `zero` is 2.
   - `one` is 0.
   - `one_perc` is 0.
   - `zero_perc` is 50.
   - `lst` is [3].

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true. Given that `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 4.
- `n` must be greater than 4.

The other states (`zero`, `one`, `one_perc`, `zero_perc`, `lst`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 4**
