Output State: **The variable `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.**

Explanation: Given the loop iterates over each element `ele` in the list `lst` and updates `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, after all iterations, `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. This is because the loop continues to update `mini` with the smallest difference found during each iteration.
