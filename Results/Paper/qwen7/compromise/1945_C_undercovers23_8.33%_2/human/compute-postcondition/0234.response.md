Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in lst:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `lst`. At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `lst` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `elem` is being used in the loop body, it will be updated to the next element in `lst` during each iteration.
   - `lst` will lose one element after each iteration because the loop processes one element at a time.

4. **Update the States**:
   - `lst` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute again. After processing one element, `lst` will have at least one less element than before.
   - `elem` will be the next element in `lst`.

Given the above points, let's update the states:

- `lst` must contain at least one element (one less than before).
- `elem` will be the next element in `lst`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`lst` must contain at least two elements, `mini` will be updated during the loop, and `final` will contain the next element in the list `elem`, where `mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` will be set to `elem`.**
