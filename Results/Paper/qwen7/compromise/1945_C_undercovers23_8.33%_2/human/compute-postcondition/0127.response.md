Output State: **`i` is 2 or 3, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `one` is `one` + 1, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, and if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `one += 1` increments the value of `one` by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from their initial states.
