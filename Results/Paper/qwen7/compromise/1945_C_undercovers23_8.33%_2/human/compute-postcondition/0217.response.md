Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `lst` contains at least one element.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `lst` must contain at least one element.
   - `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `lst` contains at least one element, for the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `mini` will be updated based on the current value of `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, but the exact value of `mini` after the update is not specified. Therefore, we only need to ensure that `lst` still contains at least one element.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `lst`, ensuring it still contains at least one element.
   - The value of `mini` does not need to be explicitly stated since it will be updated within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `lst` must contain at least one element**
