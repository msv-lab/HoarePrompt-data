Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` because `range(n - 1)` generates values from `0` to `n-2`.
   - The initial value of `n` is given as `n // 2`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(n - 1)` to execute, `n - 1` must be at least 1 (i.e., `n` must be at least 2).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 so that the loop can execute.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
