State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2⋅10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `t` as the upper limit for the range function, meaning the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because the range function in Python (and similar constructs in other languages) requires a non-negative starting point and a positive or zero endpoint.
3. The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4`, so `t` must fall within this range.
4. No other variables or states need to be adjusted since the only variable involved in the loop head is `t`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2⋅10^4.
