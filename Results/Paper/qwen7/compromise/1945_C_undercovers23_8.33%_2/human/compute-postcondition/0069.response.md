Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.
- `final` now contains the first element of `lst` followed by `elem`.
- `elem` is the second element of `lst`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for elem in lst:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `elem` is being iterated over each element in the list `lst`.
- The initial state tells us that `elem` is already the second element of `lst` after the previous iteration.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `elem` needs to be the third element of `lst`.
- Since `mini` and `final` are determined based on the values of `pk` and `lst`, and they do not change unless `abs(pk - elem)` is updated, we don't need to adjust these variables for the next iteration.

### Updated State:
- `mini` remains unchanged because it is based on the values of `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, and we haven't processed the third element yet.
- `final` remains unchanged because it is constructed from the first element of `lst` followed by `elem`, and `elem` is still the second element.
- `elem` becomes the third element of `lst`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` now contains the first element of `lst` followed by the third element of `lst`, and `elem` is the third element of `lst`.**
