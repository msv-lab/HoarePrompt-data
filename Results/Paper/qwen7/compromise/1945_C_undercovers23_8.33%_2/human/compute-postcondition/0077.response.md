Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(pk - elem)` value, and `elem` is the last element of `lst`; `final` is sorted. The length of `final` is 0, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`**.

Explanation: The code `c1 = o * 100 // n` calculates the integer division of `o * 100` by `n` and assigns the result to `c1`. The values of `mini`, `final`, `pk`, and `lst` remain unchanged from the initial state. The length of `final` is still 0.
