Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop is iterating over each element `ele` in the list `lst`.
- The variable `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` at the end of each iteration.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.
- This means that `mini` now holds the minimum value found so far between its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the current element `ele`.

### Loop Head:
- The loop is defined as `for ele in lst:`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `ele` and `lst`.
2. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `lst`, the variable `ele` will change to the next element in the list.
   - The variable `mini` is updated based on the current value of `ele`, but it is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted here.
   - The list `lst` itself does not change within the loop head; it remains the same.

### Adjusted State:
- `mini` will be updated again in the next iteration based on the new value of `ele`.
- Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `ele` to the next element in the list `lst`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in the list `lst`**
