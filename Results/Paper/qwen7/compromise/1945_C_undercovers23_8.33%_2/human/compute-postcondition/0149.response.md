Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`.
- `final` contains the element `elem` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.
- `lst` must contain at least one element.

### Loop Head:
```python
for elem in lst:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `lst`.
   - After the previous iteration, `lst` must still contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `elem` is being iterated over each element in `lst`, it will be set to the next element in the list during the next iteration.
   - The variable `mini` and `final` are not directly affected by the loop head; they are determined by the loop body, which is omitted here.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the list `lst` must still contain at least one element, and `elem` will be set to the next element in the list.

### Final State:
State: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, `final` contains the element `elem` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, and `lst` must contain at least one element.** (Note: `elem` will be updated to the next element in the list during the next iteration.)

However, since we need to explicitly state the changes, the relevant adjustments are:
- `lst` must contain at least one element.
- `elem` will be set to the next element in the list during the next iteration.

Thus, the final state can be summarized as:
State: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, `final` contains the element `elem` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`, and `lst` must contain at least one element.** (with the understanding that `elem` will be updated to the next element in the list during the next iteration.)
