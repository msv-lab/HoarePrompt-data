Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `lst` must contain at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value (which will be the smallest `abs(pk - ele)` encountered during the loop) and `abs(pk - ele)` for each iteration; `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for elem in lst:
    if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
        final.append(elem)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` will be updated during the loop, and `final` will contain the value of `elem` where `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` will be updated during the loop, and `final` will contain the next element in the list `elem`, where `mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` will be set to `elem`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `lst` must contain at least two elements, `mini` remains unchanged, and `final` contains either the next element in the list `elem` (if the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`) or `final` remains unchanged (if the absolute difference does not equal `mini`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
