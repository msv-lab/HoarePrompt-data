Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, `one_perc` is 0, `zero_perc` is 50; `lst` is [3]**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50` is true, then `i` becomes 3, `one_perc` becomes 0, and `lst` is set to `[3]`. Since there is no else part, the values of `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `lst` remain unchanged if the condition is false.
