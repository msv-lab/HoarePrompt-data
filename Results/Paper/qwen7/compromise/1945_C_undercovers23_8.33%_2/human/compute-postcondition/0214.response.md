Output State: **i is 3, n is n // 4, zero is 5, one is 4, zero_perc is 55.6, one_perc is 100, and lst contains [2, 3, 4].**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, it means `i` is now 2. Since `n` is halved each iteration, after 3 iterations, `n` will be `n // 4`. The counts of '0' and '1' in `sl` increase with each iteration based on the characters in the string `s`. After 3 iterations, `zero` is 5 and `one` is 4. The percentages `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are calculated as the ceiling of the respective counts divided by the current index `i + 1` and the remaining length of the string `n - i - 1`, respectively. Since the conditions for appending to `lst` were met in the previous iterations, `lst` contains `[2, 3, 4]` after the third iteration.
