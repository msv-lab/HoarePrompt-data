Output State: **`mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.**

This means that `mini` has been updated to store the smaller value between its previous value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The exact numerical value of `mini` now depends on the values of `pk`, `ele`, and the original value of `mini` before the line of code was executed.
