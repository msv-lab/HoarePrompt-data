Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `one` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[i] != '0'` is met, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, and if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]; lst` now contains `[i + 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` can be either 1 or 2, `lst` will contain `[i + 1]`, which means it will be either `[2]` or `[3]`. The values of `n`, `zero`, `one`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
