Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `lst`. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list.

3. **Determine the state changes**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` will be updated during the loop, and `final` will contain the value of `elem` where `abs(pk - elem)` is equal to `mini`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `lst`, at the start of the next iteration, `elem` will be the next element in the list.
   - `lst` will be the list without the current `elem` (i.e., `lst` will be reduced by one element).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `mini` might or might not change depending on the loop body, but it doesn't affect the state adjustment directly.
   - `final` will be updated if the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini` is met, but since we are adjusting the state before the loop body runs, we cannot know the exact value of `final` yet.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the reduction of `lst` by one element and the update of `elem` to the next element in the list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` will be updated during the loop, and `elem` will be the next element in the list.**
