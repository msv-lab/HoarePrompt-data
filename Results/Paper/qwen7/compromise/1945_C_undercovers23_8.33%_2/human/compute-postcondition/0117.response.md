`one` is incremented by 1. Given the initial state, the value of `one` changes, but the exact value depends on its initial state. Since `one_perc` is calculated based on `one` and other variables, updating `one` will affect `one_perc`. However, without knowing the exact initial value of `one`, we cannot determine the new value of `one_perc` precisely. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1 (if it was 0) or 2 (if it was 1), `n` is at least 2, `zero` is 1, `one` is increased by 1, `one_perc` is recalculated based on the new value of `one`, and if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]`.**
