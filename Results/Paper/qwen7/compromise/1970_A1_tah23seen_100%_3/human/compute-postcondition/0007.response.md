Output State: **`ans` is an empty string, `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s` minus 1, `d` is a dictionary where each key from 0 to n (inclusive) represents the balance of parentheses up to that index in `s`. The value at each key is the difference between the number of '(' and ')' characters from the start of the string up to that index.**

Explanation: The code `d.pop(n)` removes the entry with key `n` from the dictionary `d`. Since `n` is the length of the string `s`, removing the entry with key `n` means that the last element of the dictionary `d` is no longer present. All other variables remain unchanged.
