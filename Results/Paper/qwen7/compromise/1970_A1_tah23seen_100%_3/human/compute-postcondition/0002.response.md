Output State: **`ans` is an empty string, `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", `n` is the length of `s`, and `d` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `d`. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `s`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and the new dictionary `d` is added to the state.
