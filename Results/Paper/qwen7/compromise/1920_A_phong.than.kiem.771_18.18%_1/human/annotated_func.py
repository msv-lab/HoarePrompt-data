#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of constraints for each test case, and for each test case, the constraints are represented as pairs of integers (a, x) where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(isOne):
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer input provided by the user.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, it reads an integer input from the user and returns it. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns the integer `1`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of multiple lines as described in the problem statement. Each test case starts with an integer n, followed by n lines describing the constraints as pairs of integers (a, x) where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `line` is the first input line which is an integer n, and `items` is a list of either the strings obtained by splitting `line` on spaces (if `space` is True) or the characters of the input line (if `space` is False).
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers converted from the items in the `items` list.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of either the strings obtained by splitting `line` on spaces or the characters of the input line, depending on the value of `space`.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes input based on two parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is True, it splits the input line on spaces and converts the resulting items to integers if `to_int` is non-empty; otherwise, it returns the split items as strings. If `space` is False, it treats the input line as a sequence of characters and returns them as a list. The function ultimately returns a list of integers if `to_int` is processed, or a list of strings or characters based on the `space` parameter.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and sym is a string representing the separator between the integers when converting the list to a string.
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
        
    #State: Output State: `string` is a concatenation of all integers in `arr` separated by `sym`.
    return string
    #The program returns the concatenation of all integers in the list `arr` separated by `sym`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym`. It concatenates all integers in the list `arr`, separating them with the string `sym`, and returns the resulting string.
