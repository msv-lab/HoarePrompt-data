Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `index != -1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `index` is not equal to -1.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `string` is a string.
   - `substring` is a non-empty string that appears at least once in `string`.
   - `indices` is a list containing one element, which is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.
   - `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute the first time if `index` is not equal to -1.
   - Given that `substring` appears at least once in `string`, `index` cannot be -1 because it has a valid index where `substring` occurs.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `index` to ensure the loop executes the first time.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `index` is already set to the correct value (the index of the first occurrence of `substring`), no changes are required to make the loop execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string that appears at least once in `string`, `indices` is a list containing one element which is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.**
