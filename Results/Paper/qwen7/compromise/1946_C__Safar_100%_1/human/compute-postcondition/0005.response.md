Output State: **`stack` is [(1, 1)], `x` is 1, `p` is 1, `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 â‰¤ k < n - 1; `visited` is an empty set; `d` is a dictionary with key (1) and value 1; `r` is 0.**

The code `x, p = stack[-1]` pops the last element from the `stack` and assigns its elements to `x` and `p` respectively. Initially, `stack` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`. After executing the code, `x` is assigned the value `1` and `p` is assigned the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
