Output State: **`stack` is [(1, 1)], `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `g` is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 â‰¤ k < n - 1; `visited` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `visited`. This does not affect the values of `stack`, `A`, `g`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
