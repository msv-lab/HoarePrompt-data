Reasoning:
- The problem requires processing multiple test cases, but the provided code snippet processes exactly 10 pairs of integers, which is not consistent with the problem statement where the number of test cases \( t \) is specified to be read from the input.
- The code initializes lists `x` and `y` with 10 elements each, even though the actual number of test cases \( t \) can vary from 1 to 100. This is incorrect because it assumes a fixed number of test cases (10).
- The code reads inputs in a loop for 10 iterations regardless of the value of \( t \). This means if \( t \) is less than 10, some inputs will be ignored, and if \( t \) is more than 10, extra inputs will be processed, leading to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
