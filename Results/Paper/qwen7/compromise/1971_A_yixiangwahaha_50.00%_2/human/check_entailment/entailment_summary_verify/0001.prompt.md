You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads 10 pairs of integers from the input, where each pair consists of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). It then prints 10 lines, each containing two integers separated by a space. For each pair, if \(x\) is less than \(y\), it prints \(x\) followed by \(y\); otherwise, it prints \(y\) followed by \(x\). The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem states that the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)). However, the provided code does not handle this correctly. Instead, it assumes that there will be exactly 10 test cases, which is hardcoded in the loop (`for i in range(10)`).

2. **Reading Input**: The code reads 10 pairs of integers from the input, but the problem specifies that the number of test cases is given first. This means the actual number of test cases can vary between 1 and 100.

3. **Output Format**: For each test case, the code should print the minimum and maximum values of the two integers. However, the provided code reads all inputs at once and processes them in a loop, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement of processing one test case at a time.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - First, read the number of test cases `t`.
   - Then, for each test case, read the two integers `x` and `y`, find the minimum and maximum, and print them.

Given these points, the provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the number of test cases and reads all inputs upfront instead of processing one test case at a time.

### Correctness:
**False**
