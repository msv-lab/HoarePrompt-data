State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is 10**

### Explanation:
- The loop `for i in range(10):` will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = 9`.
- The variables `i` and `n` (where `n` is the upper limit of the range) are the only variables in the loop head.
- For the loop to execute, `i` must start at 0 and `n` must be 10.
- The initial values of `t`, `x`, and `y` do not affect whether the loop will execute, so they remain as given.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being 0 and `n` being 10.
