### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to validate the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array itself.

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Beautiful:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set. If the set has only one unique element, it prints `-1`.

3. **Finding Minimum Count of Consecutive Identical Elements:**
   - The program iterates through the array and counts consecutive identical elements.
   - It keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive identical elements and prints this value as the result.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that the function checks if the array is beautiful and prints `-1` if it is. Otherwise, it finds the minimum count of consecutive identical elements and prints this value.

#### Evaluation:
1. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies if the array is already beautiful by checking if all elements are the same.
   - However, the logic for finding the minimum count of consecutive identical elements is flawed. The program does not ensure that the array becomes non-beautiful after removing the identified number of elements. Instead, it simply prints the minimum count of consecutive identical elements, which does not guarantee that the array will become non-beautiful.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array is already beautiful correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, it fails to handle cases where removing elements is necessary but does not account for the correct logic to minimize the number of removals.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     5
     1 2 1 2 1
     ```
     The program outputs `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because removing the element at index `2` (value `1`) would make the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful anymore. However, the program does not correctly identify this scenario.
   - For the input:
     ```
     3
     2 2 2
     ```
     The program outputs `-1`, which is correct because the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. However, the program's logic for determining the minimum number of removals is flawed and does not generalize correctly for all cases.

Based on the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it non-beautiful.

### Final:
**False**
