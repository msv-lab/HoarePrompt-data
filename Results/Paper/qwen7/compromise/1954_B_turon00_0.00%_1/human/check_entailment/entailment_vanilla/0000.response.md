### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Solution Analysis:**
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if all elements in the array are the same. If yes, it prints `-1` because removing any element won't change the fact that the array is beautiful.
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to find unique elements.
   - If there's only one unique element, it prints `-1`.
   - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive occurrences of the same element (`cnt`).
   - It updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive elements found during the iteration.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic for checking if the array is already uniform is correct.
   - The approach to finding the minimum number of removals to break the beauty of the array is flawed.
   - The current implementation only counts consecutive occurrences and doesn't consider the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing specific elements.

4. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The solution would incorrectly output `1`, but the correct answer should be `1` (remove the second element).

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty of the array. The current approach only counts consecutive elements and does not account for the specific operations required to break the beauty condition.

**Correctness: False**
