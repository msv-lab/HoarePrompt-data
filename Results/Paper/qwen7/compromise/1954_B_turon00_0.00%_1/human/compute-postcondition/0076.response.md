Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.
- `i` equals `n`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`.
- `t` is `t - 1` which is greater than 0.
- `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(-1)
```

This statement will print the integer `-1` regardless of the values of other variables or objects.

Output: **-1**
