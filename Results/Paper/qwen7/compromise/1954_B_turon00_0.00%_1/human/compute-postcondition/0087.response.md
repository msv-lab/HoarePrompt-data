Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`; `cnt` is 0; `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0, which is a specific value. The other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
