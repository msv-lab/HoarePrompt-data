Output State: **All elements in the list `a` have been iterated over, `i` equals `n`, `ans` contains the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will equal `n` because the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches `n`. The variable `cnt` will hold the maximum count of consecutive elements that were equal to `tmp` found during the loop's execution. The variable `ans` will store the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` whenever `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`. Therefore, `ans` will contain the smallest sequence length of consecutive elements that were equal to `tmp` throughout the entire list `a`.
