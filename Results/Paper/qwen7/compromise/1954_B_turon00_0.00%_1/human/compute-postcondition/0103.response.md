Output State: **`ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution, `cnt` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `tmp` retains its initial value, and `a` remains as the list of integers provided initially.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration if `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`, `cnt` will be 0 at the end of the loop. Therefore, `ans` will hold the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution. The other variables (`i`, `tmp`, and `a`) retain their states from the initial conditions.
