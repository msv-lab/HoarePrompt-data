Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is in the range `range(n)`.
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` (as given in the postcondition).
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

2. **Determine the new value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.

3. **Determine the new value of `n`:**
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - It must still be greater than 1.

4. **Consider the loop body:**
   - The loop body increments `cnt` by 1 if `a[1]` equals `tmp`.
   - Otherwise, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`.

5. **Adjust the states:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - The values of `a[1]`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` are not specified to change, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**.
