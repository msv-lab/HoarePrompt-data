Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program uses a min-heap to find the minimum number of operations needed, but this approach does not always yield the optimal solution.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
4
7 3 3 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1
```

This is incorrect because the optimal solution involves increasing the value at index 1 and index 3 from 3 to 4, resulting in the array `[7, 4, 4, 1]`. In this case, the median becomes 4, which requires 2 operations.

The program's approach of using a min-heap to incrementally increase the smallest elements until the median is increased does not guarantee the minimum number of operations. A more accurate approach would involve sorting the array and directly calculating the difference between the current median and the next possible median value after the necessary increments.
