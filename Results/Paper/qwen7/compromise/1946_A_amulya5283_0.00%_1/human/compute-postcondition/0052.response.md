Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 5, `arr` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], `results` is [5], `operations` is 5, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `[1, 2, 3, 4]` with the smallest element being `1`, `median_index` is 2, `current_median` is `1`, `smallest` is `1**

The code `current_median = arr[median_index]` assigns the value of `arr[2]` (which is `2` since list indices start from `0`) to `current_median`. However, the problem statement specifies that `current_median` is initially `1`, which implies that the assignment does not change the value of `current_median` as per the given precondition. Therefore, `current_median` remains `1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
