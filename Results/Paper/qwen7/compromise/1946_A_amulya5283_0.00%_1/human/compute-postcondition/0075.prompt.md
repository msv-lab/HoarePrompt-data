You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (the length of the array a) followed by n integers representing the array a. Additionally, the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, arr = test_cases[i]
        
        arr.sort()
        
        median_index = n // 2
        
        current_median = arr[median_index]
        
        heap = arr[median_index:]
        
        heapq.heapify(heap)
        
        operations = 0
        
        while heap[0] <= current_median:
            smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
            heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the total number of operations performed across all test cases, `i` is equal to the total number of test cases, `operations` is the sum of operations performed for each test case, and `heap` is empty.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `results` will contain the total number of operations performed across all test cases. The value of `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases since the loop runs for each test case exactly once. The variable `operations` will hold the sum of operations performed for each test case. Since the loop processes each test case and empties the heap at the end, the heap will be empty.
    return results
    #`results` is a list containing the total number of operations performed across all test cases, `i` is equal to the total number of test cases, `operations` is the sum of operations performed for each test case, and `heap` is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) followed by `n` integers representing the array `a`. The function returns a list containing the total number of operations performed across all test cases, the total number of test cases, the sum of operations performed for each test case, and an empty heap.

```

Return Postconditions: `results` is a list containing the total number of operations performed across all test cases, `i` is equal to the total number of test cases, `operations` is the sum of operations performed for each test case, and `heap` is empty.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
