Output State: **`smallest` is 5, `heap` is now a list containing [4, 5, 5], `median_index` is 1, `current_median` is 5, `operations` is increased by 2**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value of `smallest + 1` into the heap. Given that `smallest` is initially 4, `smallest + 1` is 5. The heap `heap` was initially `[4, 5]`. After pushing 5, the heap becomes `[4, 5, 5]`. The `smallest` variable is updated to 5 because it is now one more than the original smallest value. The `median_index` remains 1, and since the new element (5) is larger than the current median (4), the `current_median` is updated to 5. The `operations` count is increased by 2, but since the exact number isn't specified, we only note that it has been increased.
