Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) followed by `n` integers representing the array `a`. Additionally, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
