Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in heap - 1], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 3, `operations` is 3, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `current_median + 1`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after removing the smallest element.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` onto the min-heap. Since `smallest + 1` was the current median before pushing, it remains the current median after pushing, but it is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the operation.
