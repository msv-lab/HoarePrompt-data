Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in heap - 1], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 4, `operations` is 4, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `current_median + 1`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after removing the smallest element.**

Explanation: The variable `operations` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
