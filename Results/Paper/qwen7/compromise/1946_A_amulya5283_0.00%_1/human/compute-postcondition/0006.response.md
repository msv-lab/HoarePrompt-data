Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr` is a sorted version of the original list from `test_cases` at index `i`, `median_index` is `i // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the sublist starting from `median_index` (inclusive) of the array `arr` to the variable `heap`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
