Output State: `results` is [number of elements in heap - the total number of operations (which is 5 in this case)], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 6, `operations` is 5, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `current_median + 1`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after removing the smallest element twice.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `heap` will contain `arr[median_index + 1:]` (i.e., all elements from the array starting from the median index up to the end). The loop continues to increment the smallest element in the heap until it exceeds the `current_median`. Since the loop executes 5 times, it means the smallest element in the heap has been incremented 5 times. Initially, the smallest element was `arr[median_index]`, and after each iteration, it gets incremented by 1. Therefore, after 5 iterations, the smallest element in the heap will be `arr[median_index] + 5`. The `results` list will have all elements except the first `median_index + 5` elements (since the smallest element has been incremented 5 times), and `i` will be set to the position where the next operation can start, which is `number of elements in heap + 6`.
