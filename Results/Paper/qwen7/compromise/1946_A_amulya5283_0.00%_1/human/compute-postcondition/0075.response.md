Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) followed by `n` integers representing the array `a`. It calculates the number of operations required to ensure that the smallest element in the second half of each array is greater than the median of the array. For each test case, it sorts the array, finds the median, and uses a min-heap to increment elements until the smallest element in the second half is greater than the median. It then sums up the operations for all test cases and returns a list containing these totals, the total number of test cases, and an empty heap.**
