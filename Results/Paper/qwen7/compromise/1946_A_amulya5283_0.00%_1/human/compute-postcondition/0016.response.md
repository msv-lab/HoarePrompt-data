Output State: **`smallest` is popped from `heap`, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `operations` is 2, and `heap` contains `smallest + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Initially, `operations` was 1, so after executing this line, `operations` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
