Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head consists of the variable `i` and the constant `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the array `a`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 because the loop starts with `i = 0`.
   - `t` must be a positive integer greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

State: **`results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples**.
