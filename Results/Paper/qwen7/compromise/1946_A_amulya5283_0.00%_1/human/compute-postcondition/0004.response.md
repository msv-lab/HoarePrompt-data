Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr` is a sorted version of the original list from `test_cases` at index `i`, `median_index` is `i // 2`.**

The code calculates the `median_index` by performing integer division (`//`) of `n` (which is the length of `arr`) by 2. Since the value of `i` is 0, `n` is also 0 (as `arr` is a sorted version of the original list from `test_cases` at index `i`), and thus `median_index` is 0 // 2, which equals 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
