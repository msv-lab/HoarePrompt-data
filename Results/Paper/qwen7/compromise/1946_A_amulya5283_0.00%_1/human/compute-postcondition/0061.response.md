Output State: **`smallest` is 2, `heap` is now a list containing [4, 4], `median_index` is 1, `current_median` is 4, `operations` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `smallest`. Initially, the heap is `[2, 4, 4]`. Popping the smallest element (which is `2`) from the heap results in `smallest` being set to `2`. The heap then becomes `[4, 4]` because the smallest element is removed and the heap property is maintained. All other variables (`median_index`, `current_median`, and `operations`) remain unchanged.
