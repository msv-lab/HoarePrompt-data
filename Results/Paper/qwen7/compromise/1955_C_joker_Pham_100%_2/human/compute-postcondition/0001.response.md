Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 0**.

The variable `sunks` is initialized to 0, which means it now holds the integer value 0. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
