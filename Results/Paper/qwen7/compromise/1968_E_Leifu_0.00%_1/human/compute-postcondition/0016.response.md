Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 and not equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 7.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 4` to `j = n`. After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `j` will be `n + 1`. Given that the loop runs until `j` reaches `n + 1`, if the loop executes 3 times as mentioned, it means `j` reaches 7. Therefore, after all iterations, `j` will be `n + 1`, which is 7 in this case. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged according to the problem statement.
