Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 and not equal to 3.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 5.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Here, `j` is explicitly defined to be 5. Therefore, the expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` will concatenate the string representation of `j` with a space and then again with the string representation of `j`.

So, the output will be:
Output: **5 5**
