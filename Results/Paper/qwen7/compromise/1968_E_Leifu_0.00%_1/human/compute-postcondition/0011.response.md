Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 and not equal to 3.
- `i` is 0.

The `print` statement is `print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))`.

However, there is no definition or initialization of the variable `j` in the provided initial state. Since `j` is not defined, it will have a default value, which in Python is `None` for non-integer types and `0` for integer types. Given that `j` is not explicitly initialized, we assume it to be `0` (the default integer value).

Therefore, the expression `str(j) + ' ' + str(j)` will result in `"0 0"`.

Output: **"0 0"**
