Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive). This means that for the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been incremented by 1 from its value in the previous iteration. Since the loop starts from 4, if `j` was 4 in the previous iteration, it would now be 5.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 5 (since `j` is now 5).

Given these points, we can conclude that the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `n` must be greater than 5.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `n` must be greater than 5**
