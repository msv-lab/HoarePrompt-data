Given the initial state where `n` must be at least 5 and `j` is `n + 1`, we can determine the value of `j`:

- Since `n` is at least 5, the smallest possible value for `n` is 5.
- Therefore, `j` would be `5 + 1`, which is 6.

The print statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

This will concatenate the string representation of `j` with itself, separated by a space.

So, the output will be:
Output: **6 6**
