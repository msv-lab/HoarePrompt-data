Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `i` will be equal to `t-1`, and `j` will be equal to `n`.

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `t` (which represents the number of times the outer loop runs) will be decremented by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `n` will be set to at least 10 based on the condition within the loop. The variable `i` will hold the value of `t-1` as it gets updated after each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `j` will be equal to `n` because it is set inside the inner loop which runs from 4 to `n`, and since `n` is at least 10, `j` will also be 10 or greater.
