Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for j in range(4, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `4` to `n + 1`. This means that `j` starts from `4` and increases until it reaches or exceeds `n + 1`.

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be at least 4.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `4` and increases, the value of `j` will be `5` if the loop continues.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least `5` (since `j` starts from `4` and increases, the next value `j` can take is `5`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` must be at least `5`.

The final state is:
State: **`n` must be at least 5**
