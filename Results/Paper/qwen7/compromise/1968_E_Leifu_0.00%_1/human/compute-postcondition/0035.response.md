Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, and `j` is `n`. If `n` equals 3, the function does not change `j`. Otherwise, `j` is incremented until it reaches `n + 1`, and `n` must be at least 9 for the loop to complete all its iterations.
