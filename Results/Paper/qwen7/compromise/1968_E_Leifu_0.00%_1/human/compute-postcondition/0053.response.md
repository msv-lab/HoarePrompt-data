Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `i` is 2, and `j` is equal to `n`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (up to 50 times as `t` can be at most 50), `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 50. The value of `n` will be at least 10 since the loop increments `n` starting from 4 up to the maximum value of `t`, which is 50. The loop variable `i` will be 2 because the loop runs twice (as per the given conditions). The variable `j` will be equal to the final value of `n`, which is at least 10.
