Based on the initial state, `n` must be at least 5. However, the code snippet provided does not define or initialize any variable named `j`. Since `j` is not defined, it cannot be determined what value it holds. Therefore, the print statement will raise a `NameError` because `j` is not defined.

Given this situation, the precise description of the output would be:

Output: **NameError: name 'j' is not defined**
