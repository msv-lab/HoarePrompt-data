Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances (\(\mathcal{H}\)) for a given \(n\).
2. The annotated program does not correctly handle all values of \(n\) as required by the problem statement. Specifically:
   - For \(n = 2\), the program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
     This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), which is correct.
   - For \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     ```
     This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), which is correct.
   - For \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     4 5
     ```
     This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), but the optimal solution should include distances up to 3 (as seen in the note example). The program does not generate the full set of distances.
   - For \(n = 5\), the program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     4 5
     5 5
     ```
     This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), again missing the distance 4.
   - For \(n = 6\), the program outputs:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     4 5
     5 5
     6 6
     ```
     This results in \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), again missing the distance 4.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
