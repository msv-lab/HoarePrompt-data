Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `kq` is the sum of `kq` and the difference between the element at index `len(a) - i - 1` and the element at index `i`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(a) // 2`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) // 2`.

6. **Determine New Value of `i`:**
   - Let's assume `i` was `i - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) // 2`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be `i - 1 + 1 = i`.

7. **New State:**
   - `a` remains a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `kq` remains the sum of `kq` and the difference between the element at index `len(a) - i - 1` and the element at index `i`.
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.

Given the above steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements; `kq` is the sum of `kq` and the difference between the element at index `len(a) - i - 1` and the element at index `i`; `i` is `i + 1`**.
