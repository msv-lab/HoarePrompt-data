Output State: **`ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of sorted integers, `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1; n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The other variables (`ntest`, `itest`, `a`, and `kq`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
