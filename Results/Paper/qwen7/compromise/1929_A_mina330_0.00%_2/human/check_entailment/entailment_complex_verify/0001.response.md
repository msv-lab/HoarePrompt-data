### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.

2. **Rearranging Elements**:
   - By sorting the array \(a\), we can pair the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.
   - This approach ensures that the differences \( (a_{i+1} - a_i) \) are maximized for each pair, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array \(a\).
   - It then calculates the beauty by iterating over the first half of the sorted array and computing the difference between the corresponding elements from the start and end of the sorted array.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Sorting the array and pairing the smallest with the largest, second smallest with the second largest, etc., ensures that the differences are maximized.
   - However, the current implementation only considers the first half of the sorted array, which means it only pairs the smallest half with the largest half. This does not necessarily maximize the beauty for all cases.

   Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:
   - Input: `n = 4`, `a = [1, 100, 2, 99]`
   - Sorted array: `[1, 2, 99, 100]`
   - Current implementation: Pairs `(1, 100)` and `(2, 99)`, resulting in a beauty of `(100 - 1) + (99 - 2) = 196`.
   - Optimal pairing: Pair `(1, 100)` and `(2, 99)` directly, but also consider the optimal arrangement of the entire array to maximize differences. In this case, the optimal beauty is actually achieved by pairing `(1, 100)` and `(2, 99)` directly, but the current implementation only considers the first half.

   Therefore, the current implementation does not guarantee the maximum beauty for all cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty of the array for all cases. While sorting and pairing the smallest with the largest elements is a good approach, the current implementation only considers the first half of the sorted array, which may not always yield the maximum beauty.

### Final:
**False**
