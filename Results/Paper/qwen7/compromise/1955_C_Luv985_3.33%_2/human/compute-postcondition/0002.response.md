Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `T`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `T`**: According to the given information, `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and this value is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `T` must be non-zero (i.e., `T` must be greater than 0).

Given that `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it is already guaranteed to be non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `T` to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

Since no adjustments are needed, we can simply repeat the program state right before the loop.

**State:**
**`T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\); all other variables retain their initial state.**
