Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from input and `k` is reduced by either `2 * mi` or `0`, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi` and `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`, and `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, or `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, and `t` is `k % 2` after breaking out of the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is 3, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 3, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[2]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[n - 3]`. If `a[r]` equals 0, then `ans` is set to 4. Otherwise, `t` is `k % 2`, `n` is an integer from input and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from input and `k` is reduced by either `2 * mi` or `0`, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 3, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi` and `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[n - 3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `T` is `T - 1`, `n` is greater than 5, `k` is adjusted based on the condition (`k - 2 * mi` if `mi * 2 <= k`, otherwise `k % 2`), `a[r]` is modified (reduced by `mi` if not zero, or `a[r]` becomes zero and `ans` increases by 2 if zero), `a[l]` is set to 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[r]` is not zero, `l` is increased by 1, and `r` is decreased by 1 if `a[r]` is not zero. The loop or if-else block is exited if `a[r]` is zero and `t` is set to `k % 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
