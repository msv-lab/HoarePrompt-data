Output State: **`a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`, and `mi - t - k // 2` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was 0. After executing this line, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
