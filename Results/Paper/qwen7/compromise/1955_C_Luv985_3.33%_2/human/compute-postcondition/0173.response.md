Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and k > 0`.

2. **Check each variable involved in the loop condition**:
   - `l < r`: This condition checks if the left pointer (`l`) is less than the right pointer (`r`). Both `l` and `r` need to be adjusted if they do not satisfy this condition.
   - `k > 0`: This condition checks if `k` is greater than 0. `k` needs to be adjusted if it does not satisfy this condition.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `a` is a list of integers converted from original strings.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `ans` is 0.
   - `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` in the last operation.
   - `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is not reduced by `2 * mi`.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - For `l < r` to be true, `l` (which is 0) should be less than `r` (which is `n - 1`). Since `l` is already 0, `r` needs to be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - For `k > 0` to be true, `k` needs to be greater than 0. If `k` is 0, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `r` and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` in the last operation, and `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is not reduced by `2 * mi`.**
