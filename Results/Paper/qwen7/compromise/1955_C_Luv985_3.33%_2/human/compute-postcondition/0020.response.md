Postcondition: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from input and `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]` and is less than or equal to half of `k`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`. The current value of `l` is 0, and the current value of `a[l]` is 0.**
