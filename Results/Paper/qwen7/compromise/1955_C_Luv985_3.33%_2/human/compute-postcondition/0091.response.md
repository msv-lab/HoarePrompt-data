Output State: **`T` is greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1`; `n` is an integer from the input; `k` is an integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list; `l` is 0; `r` is `n - 1`; `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
