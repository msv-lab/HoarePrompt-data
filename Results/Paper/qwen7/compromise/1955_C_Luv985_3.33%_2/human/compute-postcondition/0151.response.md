Output State: **`l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` must be greater than `mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, and `ans` is 2; `t` is `k % 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
