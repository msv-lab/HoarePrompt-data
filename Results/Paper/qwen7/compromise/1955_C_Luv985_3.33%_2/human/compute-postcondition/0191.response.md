Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 1, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2`, if the current value of `a[r]` is 0, then `a[r]` is decreased by `mi` and `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.
