Output State: **`a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi`, `t` is `k % 2`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from `a[r]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a[r]` is updated, while the rest of the variables retain their initial conditions.
