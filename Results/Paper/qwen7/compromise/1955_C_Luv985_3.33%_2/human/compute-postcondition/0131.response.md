Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2`, `ans` is 1.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was 0, so after executing this line, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables (`l`, `r`, `mi`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
