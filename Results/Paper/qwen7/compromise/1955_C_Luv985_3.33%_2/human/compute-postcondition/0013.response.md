Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from input and `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the minimum value between `a[l]` (which is `a[0]`) and `a[r]` (which is `a[n - 1]`) to the variable `mi`. All other variables remain unchanged.
