Output State: **Postcondition: `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` must be greater than `mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`, and `ans` is 2; `t` is `k % 2`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal one. All the conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
