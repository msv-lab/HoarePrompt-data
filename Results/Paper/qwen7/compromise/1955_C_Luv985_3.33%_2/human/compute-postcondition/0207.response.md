Output State: **`a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by `2 * mi`, where `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r]) - mi`. All other variables remain unchanged.
