Output State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` must be greater than 5, `k` must be greater than `2 * mi`, `a[r]` is reduced by `mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= mi` reduces the value of `a[r]` by `mi`. The value of `mi` is defined as the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. The other variables (`T`, `n`, `k`, `a[l]`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
