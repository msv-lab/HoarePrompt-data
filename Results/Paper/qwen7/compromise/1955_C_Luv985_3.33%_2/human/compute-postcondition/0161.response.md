Postcondition: **After the execution of the if-else block, `T` is greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1`, `n` remains an integer from the input, `k` is less than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is the total number of times `a[l]` or `a[r]` became zero plus `k >= a[l]`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` in the last operation, and `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is not reduced by `2 * mi`.**
