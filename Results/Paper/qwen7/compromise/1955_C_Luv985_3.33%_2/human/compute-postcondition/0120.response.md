Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**

Explanation: The code decrements `a[r]` by the value of `mi`. The values of `l`, `r`, `mi`, `a[0]`, and `a[r]` are updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
