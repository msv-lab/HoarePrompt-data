Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and k > 0`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `T` is `T - 1`
   - `n` is an integer from input
   - `k` is an integer from input
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda
   - `l` is 0
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - `ans` is 0

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop can only execute if both conditions `l < r` and `k > 0` are true.
   - `l` is currently 0.
   - `r` is currently `n - 1`.
   - For `l < r` to be true, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `r = n - 1`).
   - `k` is currently an integer from input, but we don't know its value yet.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - To satisfy `l < r`, `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `k` can be any positive integer since it is an input and we are not given any specific constraint on its value.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 1 and `k` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from input and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer from input and `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the strings in the original list `a` using map and lambda, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0**
