Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

The code `t = k % 2` assigns the value of `k % 2` to the variable `t`. Since the initial values of the other variables (`l`, `r`, and `mi`) are not affected by this line of code, they remain the same. The value of `t` is determined by the operation `k % 2`, which calculates the remainder when `k` is divided by 2.
