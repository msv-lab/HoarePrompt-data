Postcondition: `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, and `ans` is 2 if `a[l]` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `k` is `k - mi * 2`, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, and `ans` is 1.
