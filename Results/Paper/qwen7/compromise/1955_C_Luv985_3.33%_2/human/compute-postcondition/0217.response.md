Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is 2, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum of `min(a[l], a[r])`, `t` is `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.**
