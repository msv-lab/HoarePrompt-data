Postcondition: `T` is greater than 0 and equal to `T - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, `k` is either `k - 2 * mi` or greater than `mi * 2`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the strings in the original list, `l` is either 1 or 0, `r` is either `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is either 1, 2, or the current value of `a[l]` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is greater than `mi * 2`.
