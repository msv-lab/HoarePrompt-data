Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers converted from original strings, `k` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `t` is `k % 2` if `k` is not reduced by `2 * mi`, and the condition `mi * 2 <= k` is true.
