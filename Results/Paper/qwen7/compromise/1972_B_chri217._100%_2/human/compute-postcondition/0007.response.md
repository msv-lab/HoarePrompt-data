Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer \( n \) (where 1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 100) and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) made up of characters "U" and "D". It then constructs a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integer \( n \) and the string \( s \) from each test case. Finally, it returns this list of tuples.**
