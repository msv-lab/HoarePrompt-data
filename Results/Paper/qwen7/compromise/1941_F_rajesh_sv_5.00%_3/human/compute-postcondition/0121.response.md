Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `total` is undefined, `students` is undefined, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the value `mid + 1`. The other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `total`, `students`, `right`, `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `l < h` must still be true, and `left` must be less than `right + f`.
