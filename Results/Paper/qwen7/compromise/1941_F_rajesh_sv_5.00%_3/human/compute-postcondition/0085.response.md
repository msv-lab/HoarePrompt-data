Postcondition: `f` is the next value in the sequence defined by `F`. If the condition `(mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum)` is true, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is recalculated accordingly. Otherwise, `l` remains the index obtained by bisecting the list `D` with the value `left - f` and `h` remains `mid`. In both cases, `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.
