Postcondition: **After the loop finishes executing, `l` and `h` will define a range in the list `D` where `D[l] + f < left` and `D[h] + f >= right`, with `l` being the last index satisfying the first condition and `h` being the first index satisfying the second condition. Additionally, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` when `l` equals `h`.**
