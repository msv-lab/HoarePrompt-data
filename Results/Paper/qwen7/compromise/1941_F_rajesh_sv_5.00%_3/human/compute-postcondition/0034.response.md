Postcondition: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or `-inf` if no other differences were found, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or `None` if no valid index was found, `i` is 7, `diff` is `A[6] - A[5]`. If `diff` is greater than `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `diff`, and `index` is updated to 7. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, otherwise `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.
