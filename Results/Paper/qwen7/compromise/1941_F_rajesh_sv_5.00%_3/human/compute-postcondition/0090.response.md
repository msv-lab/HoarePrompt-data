Output State: **`l` is `mid + 1`, `h` is the upper bound, `mid` is the value of `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`**.

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. The values of `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the assignment to `l`.
