Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_diff`: Maximum difference found so far.
   - `next_max_diff`: Second largest difference or `-inf` if no other differences were found.
   - `index`: Index where `max_diff` occurred or `None` if no valid index was found.
   - `i`: 5.
   - If `diff > max_diff`, `max_diff` is updated to `diff` and `index` is set to 5; otherwise, if `diff > next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1, the next value of `i` will be `6`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to `6`.
   - `n` must be greater than `6` for the loop to continue executing.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or `-inf` if no other differences were found, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or `None` if no valid index was found, `i` is 6, and `n` must be greater than 6**.
