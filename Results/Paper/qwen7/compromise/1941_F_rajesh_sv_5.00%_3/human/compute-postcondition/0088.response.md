Output State: **`l` is the lower bound, `h` is the upper bound, `mid` is the value of `l + (h - l) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` between the lower bound `l` and the upper bound `h` using the formula `l + (h - l) // 2`. This formula ensures that the division operation is integer division (`//`), which is useful in algorithms like binary search. The values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged, but `mid` is now assigned the calculated value.
