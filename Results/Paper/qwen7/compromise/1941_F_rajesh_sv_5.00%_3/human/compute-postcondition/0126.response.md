Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `total` is undefined, `students` is undefined, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` must be greater than `l`, and `l` must be less than `h`.**

Explanation: The code does not change the values of any variables; it simply reassigns `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to the same expressions they already had. Therefore, the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged. All other variables (`total`, `students`, `mid`, `h`, and `l`) also remain in their original states.
