Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(testcases):`. The only variable in the loop head is `testcases`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `testcases`**: According to the given information, `testcases` is the result of calling `func_3()`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `testcases` is a positive integer. Since `testcases` is the result of `func_3()`, we need to ensure that `func_3()` returns a positive integer for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `testcases` is a positive integer. Given that `testcases` is the result of `func_3()`, we can only adjust the state of `testcases` to be a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `testcases` being a positive integer.

**State:**
**`testcases` must be a positive integer**
