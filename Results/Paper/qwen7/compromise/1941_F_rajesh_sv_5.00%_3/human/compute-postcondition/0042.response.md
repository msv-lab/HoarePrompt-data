Output State: **`h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`.**

Explanation: The variable `h` is assigned the value of `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`. This does not affect the value of `l`, which remains as the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`.
