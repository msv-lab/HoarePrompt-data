Output State: **`l` is the lower bound, `h` is the upper bound, `mid` is the value of `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`**.

This means that the value of `mid` remains unchanged as it was previously calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`. The new variables `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are now assigned the values `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively.
