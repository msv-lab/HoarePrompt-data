Output State: **`f` is the next value in the sequence defined by `F`; `l` is the index obtained by bisecting the list `D` with the value `left - f`.**

Explanation: The code `l = bisect_right(D, left - f)` calculates the index in the list `D` where the value `left - f` would fit such that all elements before this index are less than or equal to `left - f`, and all elements at and after this index are greater than `left - f`. The variable `f` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the variable `l` is assigned the result of the `bisect_right` operation.
