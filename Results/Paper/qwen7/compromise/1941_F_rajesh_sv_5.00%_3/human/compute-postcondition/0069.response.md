Output State: The loop continues to execute until `l` is no longer less than `h`. After all iterations, `l` will be the largest index such that all elements in `D` up to index `l` satisfy the condition `D[i] + f < left` and the next element `D[l+1] + f >= left`. `h` will be the smallest index greater than `l` where `D[h] + f >= right`. `mid` will be the midpoint between `l` and `h` calculated during each iteration. `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will be `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, `l` and `h` will define a range in the list `D` where `D[l] + f < left` and `D[h] + f >= right`, with `l` being the last index satisfying the first condition and `h` being the first index satisfying the second condition.
