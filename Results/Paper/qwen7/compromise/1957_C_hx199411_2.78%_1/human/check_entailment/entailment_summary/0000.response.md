Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. The player and the computer take turns placing rooks, and the computer mirrors the player's moves unless the move is on the main diagonal. The goal is to calculate the number of unique final configurations after \( k \) moves, considering the mirroring effect and the constraints.

2. **Key Points in the Program**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It calculates the number of rooks placed on the main diagonal (`num`).
   - It then computes the number of empty cells left (`m = n - num`).
   - The program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations for the remaining empty cells.

3. **Dynamic Programming Explanation**:
   - The base cases for the DP array `dp` are correctly set: `dp[1] = 1` (one cell can be filled in one way) and `dp[2] = 3` (two cells can be filled in three ways: both empty, one filled horizontally, or one filled vertically).
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations for `i` cells. This formula accounts for the fact that each new cell can either be empty or filled in one of two orientations (horizontal or vertical), and it builds upon the previous configurations.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `m == 0`, there are no empty cells left, so the number of configurations is `0`.
   - When `m == 1`, there is exactly one empty cell, and it can be filled in one way, so the number of configurations is `1`.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The program correctly applies the modulo operation to handle large numbers, which is necessary given the constraints.

Given the above points, the program logic and implementation align with the problem requirements and the provided execution summary. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
