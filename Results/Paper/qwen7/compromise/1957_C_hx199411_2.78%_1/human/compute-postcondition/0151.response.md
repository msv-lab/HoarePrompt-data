Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers t, n, k, and k pairs of coordinates (r_i, c_i). It calculates the number of rooks placed on the main diagonal and computes a dynamic programming array dp based on this count. Finally, it prints the value of dp[m], where m is derived from the initial values of n and the count of rooks on the main diagonal.**
