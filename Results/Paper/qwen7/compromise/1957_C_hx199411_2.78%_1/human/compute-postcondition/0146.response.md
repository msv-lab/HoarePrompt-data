Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is `False`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `num` is an integer between `k` and `2*k`.
- `i` is `m`, which is greater than 5.
- `c` is an input integer from the split input.
- `r` is an input integer from the split input.
- `m` is `n - num` and is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1.
- `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements, where each element is an integer. Starting from `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`, the list is filled according to the recurrence relation: 
  - `dp[1] = 1`
  - `dp[2] = 3`
  - For `i` from 3 to `m`, `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % 1000000007`.

The value of `dp[m]` is the last element of the `dp` list, which is computed based on the recurrence relation provided.

Given that `m` is greater than 5, the `dp` list will have more than 6 elements, and the value of `dp[m]` will be the result of the recurrence relation applied iteratively from `dp[1]` to `dp[m]`.

Output: **dp[m]**
