Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is 1, `k` must be a positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and the current value of `c` is equal to the current value of `r`.**

The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` (which is `i`) by 1. Given that the initial value of `i` is 0, after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
