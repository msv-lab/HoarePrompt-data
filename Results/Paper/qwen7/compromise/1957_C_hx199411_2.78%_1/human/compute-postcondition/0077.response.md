Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `k + 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` and `r` are input integers, and `num` is the total number of inputs processed, with `num` incremented by 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r` and by 2 for each pair where `c` does not equal `r`.**

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has completed its iterations. The variable `i` will be `k + 2` because the loop increments `i` from `0` to `k-1`, and then `i` is set to `k + 2` outside the loop. The variable `num` accumulates the total count of input pairs processed, with each pair contributing either 1 or 2 to `num` based on whether `c` equals `r`. The values of `c` and `r` will be the last inputs provided during the loop's execution, and `k` will retain its value from the initial state since it is not modified within the loop.
