Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is `k + 2`, `k` must be at least 3, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not, `m` is a non-zero integer calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 2, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, `dp[i]` is updated to \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\), `dp[i]` is updated to \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10 ** 9 + 7)\)**.

The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\). Since the exact values of `i`, `dp[i-1]`, and `dp[i-2]` are not specified, the updated value of `dp[i]` depends on these values. However, the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
