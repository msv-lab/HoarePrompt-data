Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function parameter `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `k`**:
   - From the given state, `i` is equal to `k`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `k-1`, so `i` should take values from `0` to `k-1`.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = k`, and the loop runs until `i < k`, the initial value of `i` must be `0` for the loop to start executing properly.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be `0` and ensure `k` is a positive integer.

4. **Other variables**:
   - `t`, `c`, `r`, `num`, `m`, `dp`, `n`, and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be a positive integer**
