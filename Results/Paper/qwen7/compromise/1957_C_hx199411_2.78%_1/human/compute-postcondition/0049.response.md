Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\).
- `i` is `k + 2`, with `k` being at least 3.
- `c` and `r` are input integers from the split.
- `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not.
- `m` is a non-zero integer calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 2, and `m` is not equal to 1.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, and `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\) for all `i` in the range from 3 to `m`.

The `print(dp[m])` statement will print the value of `dp[m]`, which is the value computed by the recurrence relation for the specific `m` defined in the initial state.

Output: **dp[m] (where dp[m] is the value computed by the recurrence relation for the specific m defined in the initial state)**
