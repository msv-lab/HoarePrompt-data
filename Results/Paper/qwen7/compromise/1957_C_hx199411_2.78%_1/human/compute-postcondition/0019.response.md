The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k`.

Given that `i` is currently 2, `k` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue executing.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split**
