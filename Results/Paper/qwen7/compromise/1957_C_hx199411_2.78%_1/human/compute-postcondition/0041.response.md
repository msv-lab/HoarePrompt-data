Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine Initial Values for `i`:**
   - The initial value of `i` is given as `i = k`.
   - The loop starts with `i` in the range `3` to `m + 1`.

3. **Check if the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[3, m + 1]`.
   - This means `i` must be at least `3` and `m + 1` must be greater than or equal to `3`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is initially set to `k`, `k` must be at least `3` for the loop to start.
   - `m` is defined as `n - num`, and it is given that `m` is not equal to `1`. Therefore, `m` must be greater than or equal to `2`.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure that `k` is at least `3` and `m` is at least `2` for the loop to execute.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is equal to `k`, `k` must be at least 3, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not, `m` is a non-zero integer calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 2, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3**
