Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `num` is either 3 or 4, depending on whether `c` equals `r`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 1. If `c` was equal to `r` before the increment, making `num` equal to 1 initially, now `num` will be 2. Otherwise, if `num` was already 2, it will become 3. The values of `i`, `k`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged.
