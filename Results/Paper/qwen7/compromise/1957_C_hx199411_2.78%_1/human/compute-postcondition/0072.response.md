Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `c` and `r`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `k` is a positive integer (though its specific value is not known), and `c` and `r` are the input integers.
