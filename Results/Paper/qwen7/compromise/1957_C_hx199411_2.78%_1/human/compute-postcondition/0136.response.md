Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: From the given state, `i` is initially set to `k-1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `3` to `m + 1`. This means `i` should start from `3` and go up to `m + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = k-1`, we need to ensure that `i` is at least `3` for the loop to start executing.

5. **Check if the initial value of `i` meets the loop condition**: Given that `i` starts at `k-1`, we need to ensure that `k-1` is at least `3` for the loop to start. However, since the loop starts at `3`, we need to ensure that `k-1` is less than `3` or `k` is at most `4` (since `k-1 < 3` implies `k <= 4`).

6. **Ensure other necessary conditions**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m + 1`. We need to ensure that `m` is greater than or equal to `3` for the loop to execute properly.

7. **Final state adjustment**: The initial value of `i` should be adjusted to be within the range `[3, m+1]`.

Given these points, the final state after adjusting the necessary variables for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer such that `k >= 4`, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2*k`, `i` is `k-1` (which is less than 3), `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**.

However, to simplify and ensure the loop starts correctly, we can directly adjust `i` to be `3` if `k-1` is less than `3`:

**State: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2*k`, `i` is `3` (if `k-1 < 3`), `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**.

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2*k`, `i` is `3` (if `k-1 < 3`), `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input, `m` is `n - num` and `m` is not equal to 0 and `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**.
