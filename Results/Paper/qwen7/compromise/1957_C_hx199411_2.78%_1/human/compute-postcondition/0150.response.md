Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where for each test case, it takes integers t, n, k, and lists of coordinates (r_i, c_i). It verifies that the conditions 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and that no two rooks share the same row or column after each move are met. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.**
