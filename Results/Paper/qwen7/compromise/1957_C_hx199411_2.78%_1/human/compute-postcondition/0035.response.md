Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\).
- `i` is equal to `k`, where `k` is a positive integer.
- `c` is an input integer from the split.
- `r` is an input integer from the split.
- `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not.
- `m` is a non-zero integer calculated as `n - num`, and the current value of `m` is 1.

The `print(1)` statement will simply print the integer 1.

Output: **1**
