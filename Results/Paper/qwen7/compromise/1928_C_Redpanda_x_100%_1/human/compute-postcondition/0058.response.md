Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer \( n \) greater than 1 and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of \( n \). If \( n \) is a prime number, it will yield \( n \) itself. The function computes the prime factorization of \( n \) and stores it in a dictionary called `factors`. It then yields each prime factor, one by one, using a generator function `generate(0)`. The final state of the program includes the prime factors stored in `factors` and the last yielded factor from `generate(0)`.**
