Output State: All prime factors in the `factors` dictionary have been processed, meaning their corresponding values are all set to -1. For each prime factor `prime` that appeared in the `factors` dictionary, `prime_to_i` will hold the product of `prime` raised to the power of its original count in `factors`. Additionally, the loop will have yielded a sequence of values, each being the product of a `factor` from `rest` and the final value of `prime_to_i` for each prime factor processed.

In more detail:
- The `factors` dictionary will no longer contain any keys with non-zero values; all values will be -1, indicating that all prime factors have been fully processed.
- The variable `prime_to_i` will hold the product of `prime` raised to the power of its original count in `factors`.
- The variable `rest` will be empty, as all factors have been processed.
- The loop will have yielded a sequence of values, each being the product of a `factor` from `rest` and the final value of `prime_to_i` for each prime factor processed.
