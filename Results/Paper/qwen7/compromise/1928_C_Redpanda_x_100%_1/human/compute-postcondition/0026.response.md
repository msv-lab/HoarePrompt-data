Output State: **`prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime_to_i`, `factors[prime]` is greater than or equal to 0, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, and `rest` contains the remaining elements after removing the current `factor`; `prime_to_i` is updated by yielding `factor * prime_to_i`.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` generates and returns the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. The values of `prime_to_i`, `factors[prime]`, `factor`, and `rest` remain unchanged except that `prime_to_i` is now used in the yield operation. The precondition that `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime_to_i` remains true, and the other conditions about `factors[prime]`, `factor`, and `rest` also hold.
