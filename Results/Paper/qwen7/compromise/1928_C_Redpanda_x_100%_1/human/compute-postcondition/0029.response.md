Output State: `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `factors[prime]` is equal to -1 (indicating that the prime factorization of `prime` has been fully processed), `factor` is the next element in `rest`, and `rest` contains the remaining elements after removing the current `factor`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `prime_to_i` will be updated to the power of `prime` based on its count in `factors`, `factors[prime]` will be set to -1 to indicate that all occurrences of `prime` as a factor have been processed, and the `factor` and `rest` variables will retain their state from the last iteration of the loop.
