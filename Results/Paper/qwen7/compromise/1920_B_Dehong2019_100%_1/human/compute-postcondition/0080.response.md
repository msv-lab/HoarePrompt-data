Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `x`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
   - `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the element at index `i`.
   - `ans2` is 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` must be greater than 0.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to continue, but since no information is given about its change, we assume it remains the same.
   - `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and their values are not affected by the loop itself.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `a` is still a sorted list of integers in descending order.
   - `ans1` remains the same.
   - `ans2` remains 0.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `x` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the element at index `i`, `ans2` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 0**.
