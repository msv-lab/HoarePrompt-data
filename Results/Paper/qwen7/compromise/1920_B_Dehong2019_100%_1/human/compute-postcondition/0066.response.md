Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by `a[i]`. The other conditions and operations (like updating `ans2` and checking if `i + x < n`) are not executed because the snippet only contains one line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`. The other variables remain in their previous states.
