Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a`; `ans2` is equal to `ans1`; `i` is equal to `x-1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2 = ans1` simply assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`. There is no change to the values of `x`, `i`, or `ans1`. Therefore, `ans2` remains the same as `ans1`, `i` is still `x-1`, and `ans1` is still decreased by 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a`.
