Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, and `i` is less than `k`; `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**.

This means that `ans2` has been updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `ans1`. The other conditions (such as `ans1` being increased by `a[i]` and `i` being less than `k`) remain unchanged.
