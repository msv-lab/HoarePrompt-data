Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`, `ans2` remains the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`, and `i` is incremented by 1. If `i + x >= n`, no additional changes are made to `ans1`, `ans2`, and `i` remains as `i + 1`. `ans2` is now updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` from the previous state.**

This means that `ans2` has been updated to reflect the maximum value between its current value and `ans1` after the operation. The other conditions (increasing `ans1`, updating `i`, and the conditional decrease of `ans1`) remain unchanged.
