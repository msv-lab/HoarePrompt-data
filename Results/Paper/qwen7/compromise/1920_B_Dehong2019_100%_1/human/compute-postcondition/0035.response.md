Output State: `ans1` is decreased by 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a` plus the sum of all elements from index `0` to `k-1` of list `a`, `ans2` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `k` is less than or equal to `n-x`, and `k` is greater than 0.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `ans1` will have been adjusted by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a` and then adding each element from `a[0]` to `a[k-1]` while also subtracting `2 * a[i+x]` whenever `i + x < n`. The value of `ans2` will be the maximum between `ans1` and `ans2` after each iteration. The variable `i` will be set to `k-1` after the last iteration, and `k` will be within the valid range of `0 < k <= n-x`.
