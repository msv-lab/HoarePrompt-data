Postcondition: `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `a[i + x] * 2`, and `ans2` remains the maximum of the updated `ans1` and `ans2`. If `i + x >= n`, no additional changes are made to `ans1` and `ans2`.
