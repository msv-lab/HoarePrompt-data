Output State: **`ans1` is increased by `a[i]`, `i` remains unchanged, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates `ans2` to be the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. Since `ans1` was already increased by `a[i]` and `i` remained unchanged, `ans2` now holds the larger value between its original value and the updated `ans1`. The initial conditions of `ans1` being increased by `a[i]` and `i` remaining unchanged are preserved.
