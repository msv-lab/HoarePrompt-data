Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers, `ans1` is the sum of the first `k` elements of list `a` after the current iteration, adjusted according to the conditions inside the loop, `ans2` is the maximum value between its current value and `ans1`.**

This means that `n`, `k`, and `x` are now integers obtained from user input, while `ans1` and `ans2` remain as described, waiting to be updated within the loop. The initial values of `ans1` and `ans2` are not specified, but they will be adjusted during the loop execution based on the sum of the first `k` elements of list `a` and the maximum value comparison.
