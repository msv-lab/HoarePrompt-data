Output State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans1` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[2]`**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of `a[i]` from `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, it means `ans1` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[2]`. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.
