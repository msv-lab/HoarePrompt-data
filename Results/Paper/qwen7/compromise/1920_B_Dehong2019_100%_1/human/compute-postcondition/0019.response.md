Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by twice the value of `a[i + x]`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `i` is equal to `x-2`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i + x` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2` decreases `ans1` by twice the value of `a[i + x]`. Since `ans2` was previously equal to `ans1`, `ans2` also gets updated to reflect this change. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
