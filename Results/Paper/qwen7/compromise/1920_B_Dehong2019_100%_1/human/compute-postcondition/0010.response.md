Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(x)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `x`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans1` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `x` must be greater than 1 (because `i` needs to be less than `x`).
   - The value of `i` will increase by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `x` must be greater than 1.
- `i` will be 2.
- The value of `ans1` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

So, the final state is:
State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `ans1` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[1]`**
