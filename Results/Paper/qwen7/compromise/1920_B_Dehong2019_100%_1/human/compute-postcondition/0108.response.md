Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `k` is greater than `i`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, and `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans2` to be the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`. The values of `i`, `k`, `ans1`, and `ans2` are updated according to the initial postconditions, but `ans2` is now set to the maximum of its current value and `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
