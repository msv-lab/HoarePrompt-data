Output State: **`ans1` is decreased by 2 times the sum of the first `x` elements of list `a` plus `a[x-1]` plus `a[i+1]` plus `a[i]`, `ans2` is equal to the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `x`, `k` is greater than 0, and `(x) + x < n`**.

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `ans1` which now includes the addition of `a[i]` to the previous value of `ans1`.
