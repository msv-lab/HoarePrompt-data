Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses based on the conditions evaluated for each string `s` read from input during the `t` iterations of the loop. For each iteration, if the count of '1's in the string `s` is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'. If the count of '1's is greater than 2 but odd, it prints 'NO'. If the count of '1's is exactly 1, it also prints 'NO'. If the substring '11' exists in `s`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
