Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `num` within the range of 1 to 10^9. It counts the number of trailing zeros in `num` (zeros at the end of the number) until it encounters the first non-zero digit. The function then returns this count. If `num` consists entirely of zeros, the returned count is also zero.**
