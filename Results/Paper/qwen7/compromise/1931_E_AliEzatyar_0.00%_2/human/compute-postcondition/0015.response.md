Output State: **`counter` is 3, `num` is an integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\), `i` is `len(num) - 3`**.

The value of `counter` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3 if the character at position `i` (which is `len(num) - 2`) in `num` was '0', or from 1 to 2 if the character was not '0'. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.
