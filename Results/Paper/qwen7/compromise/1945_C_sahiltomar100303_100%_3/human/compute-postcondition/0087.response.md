Postcondition: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus either 1 or 2, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2` and has been incremented by 1 if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` and is less than `mid // 2**.
