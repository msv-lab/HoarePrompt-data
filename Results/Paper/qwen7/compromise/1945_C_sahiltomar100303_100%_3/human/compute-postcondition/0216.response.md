Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `mid + 2`, and `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

In this scenario, the variable `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The values of `total` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `total` is still 0, `i` is still `mid + 2`, and `rightOne` has been increased by 1.
