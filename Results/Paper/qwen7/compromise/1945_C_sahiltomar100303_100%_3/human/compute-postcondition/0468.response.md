Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` is equal to `n`.
- `left` remains 0.
- `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.
- `trightZero` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `trightOne` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.
- `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to 0.
- The condition `tleftZero < (n + 1) // 2` is true.

The `print(left)` statement will print the value of the variable `left`.

Given that `left` is explicitly stated to remain 0, the output will be:

Output: **0**
