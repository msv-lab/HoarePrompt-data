Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is 0**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `rightZero`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `leftZero`) remain unchanged.
