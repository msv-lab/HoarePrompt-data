Output State: `left` is equal to 0, `leftZero` is equal to `trightZero + rightZero - k`, `rightZero` is equal to `rightZero + k`, and `rightOne` is equal to `rightOne + k`, where `k` is the total number of times the loop executed.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `left > 0` and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` holds true. Each iteration of the loop decreases `left` by 1, adjusts `leftZero` and `rightZero` based on the value of `s[left - 1]`, and similarly adjusts `leftOne` and `rightOne`. After all iterations, `left` will reach 0, `leftZero` will be reduced by the number of zeros encountered from the end of the string, `rightZero` will increase by the number of zeros encountered from the end, and `rightOne` will increase by the number of ones encountered from the end.
