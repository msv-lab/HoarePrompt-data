Output State: **`left` is `mid - 2`, `leftZero` is `trightZero + rightZero - 1`, and `rightOne` must satisfy the condition `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `leftZero -= 1` decreases the value of `leftZero` by 1. Given the initial state where `left` is `mid - 1` and `leftZero` is `trightZero + rightZero`, after decrementing `leftZero`, its new value becomes `trightZero + rightZero - 1`. The value of `mid` remains unchanged, so `left` becomes `mid - 2`. The condition for `rightOne` remains the same as it is not affected by this operation.
