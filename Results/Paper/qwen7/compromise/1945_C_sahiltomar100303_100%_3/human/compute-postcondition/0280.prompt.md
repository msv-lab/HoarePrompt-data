Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `leftZero` will be adjusted based on the values of the characters in the string `s` up to the point where the condition `left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)` no longer holds true, `rightZero` will be the total count of '0's from index `mid` to the final value of `left`, `rightOne` will be the total count of '1's from index `mid` to the final value of `left`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` will remain 0, `tleftZero` will be the count of '0's from index `0` to `mid-1`, `tleftOne` will be the count of '1's from index `0` to `mid-1`, `s` will remain the same as the input string, `left` will be 0, `leftMove` will be 0, `right` is set to `mid`.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 1, `tleftZero` is increased by 1 if the character at index `right-1` in string `s` was '0', otherwise `tleftOne` is increased by 1; `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if the character at index `right-1` in string `s` was '0', otherwise `trightOne` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 2, `tleftZero` is increased by 1 if `s[right-1]` was '0', otherwise it is decreased by 1; `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right-1]` was '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `trightOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[right-1]` was not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right-1]` was not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `s` is a string, `right` is the original index plus 1, `tleftZero` is increased by 1 if `s[right-2]` is '0', otherwise it is decreased by 1; `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right-2]` is '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `trightOne` is decreased by 1; `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right-2]` is not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
