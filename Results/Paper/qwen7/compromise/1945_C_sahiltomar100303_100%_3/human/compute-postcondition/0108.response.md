Postcondition: `total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1 (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `tleftZero` is either 0 or 1, `trightZero` is 1 less than its previous value, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', `right` must be less than `n` and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must hold true.
