Output State: **`right` must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, and `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2`**.

The variable `tleftZero` is incremented by 1, while the other conditions and constraints remain unchanged. Therefore, `right` must still be less than `n`, `tleftZero` is now one more than its previous value, and `trightOne` must still be less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2`.
