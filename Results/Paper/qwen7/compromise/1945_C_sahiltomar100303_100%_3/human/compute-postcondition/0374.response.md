Output State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid + 2`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 (rightZero is now rightZero + 1)**

The code `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` was previously increased by 1 before this line of code, it is now increased by another 1, making it `rightZero + 1`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
