Output State: **`tleftZero` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `rightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'**.

The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since the initial value of `leftZero` was 0, it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
