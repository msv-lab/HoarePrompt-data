Output State: **`right` remains `mid`; - `n` remains unchanged; - `tleftZero` is increased by 1; - `trightZero` is decreased by 1; - `trightOne` must be less than `(n - right + 1) // 2`; - The value of `s[right]` is '0'.**

The code `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
