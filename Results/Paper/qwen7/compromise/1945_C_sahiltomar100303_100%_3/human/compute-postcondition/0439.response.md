Output State: **`right` is `right + 1`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(mid + 3) // 2`, and `trightOne` must be less than `(n - mid - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The variable `right` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remain unchanged because the code does not modify these variables. The initial conditions for `tleftZero` and `trightOne` are still valid after the increment operation.
