Output State: **`tleftZero` is either 0 or 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `rightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is either 1 or 4, `leftOne` is 3, `tleftOne` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. Since `leftOne` is initially 3 if `s[i]` is not '0', and `i` is either 1 or 4, it means `s[1]` or `s[4]` is not '0', so `leftOne` is 3. After incrementing `tleftOne` by 1, its value becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
