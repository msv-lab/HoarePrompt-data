Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
