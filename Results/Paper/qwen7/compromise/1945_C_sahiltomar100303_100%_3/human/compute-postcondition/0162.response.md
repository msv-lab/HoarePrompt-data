Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value, `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1, `tleftZero` is 3 if `s[right]` is '0' and 2 if `s[right]` is '1', `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', `right` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `rightZero` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `rightZero = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `rightZero`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `total`, `students`, `trightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `right`, `n`, `t`, `mid`, `s`, and `leftZero` remain unchanged from their initial states.
