Postcondition: **`right` is the maximum index such that the condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` still holds, `tleftZero` is the total count of '0's from index `0` to `right-1`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's from `right` to the final value of `left`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's from `right` to the final value of `left`, `tleftOne` is the total count of '1's from index `0` to `right-1`, `left` is the last index where the condition was met, `leftMove` is the number of times `left` was incremented, and `s` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `right` equals `n`, either `left` is not equal to 0 and the condition still holds, or `left` is 0 and the condition does not hold, or `left` is 0 and `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` does not equal `n`, `left` is not equal to 0, and the condition is adjusted accordingly to ensure `right` is the maximum index satisfying the condition.**
