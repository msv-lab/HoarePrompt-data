Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid`. The variable `rightZero` will be equal to the total number of '0's in the substring from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `trightZero` will also be equal to the total number of '0's in the same substring. Similarly, the variable `rightOne` will be equal to the total number of '1's in the substring from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `trightOne` will also be equal to the total number of '1's in the same substring.

This means that after the loop completes, `i` will have reached the end of the specified range, and `rightZero` and `rightOne` will hold the counts of '0's and '1's respectively in the substring starting from `mid` to the end of the string `s`.
