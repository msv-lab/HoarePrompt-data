`tleftOne` is incremented by 1. According to the initial state, `s[mid + 1]` is '0' if `tleftZero` is increased by 1, and since `tleftOne` is increased by 1, `s[mid + 1]` is not '0'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`right` is `mid + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `tleftZero` must be less than \(\left\lceil \frac{mid + 2}{2} \right\rceil - 1\), `trightZero` is either decreased by 1 or remains the same, `trightOne` must be less than \(\frac{n - mid}{2} + 1\), `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`, `s[mid + 1]` is not '0'.**
