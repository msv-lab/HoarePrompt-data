Output State: **`i` is `mid + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 2`, `rightZero` is increased by 1 (i.e., `rightZero` is now `rightZero + 1`).**

The code `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `i` and `n` are not affected by this line of code, their values remain the same as the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `rightZero`.
