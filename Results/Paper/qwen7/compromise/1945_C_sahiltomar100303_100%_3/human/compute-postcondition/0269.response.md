Postcondition: `s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 1. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and `trightZero` is decreased by 1. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `trightOne` is decreased by 1 and `tleftOne` is increased by 1. Both `tleftZero` and `trightZero` must satisfy their original constraints, and `tleftOne` and `trightOne` must also satisfy their respective constraints.
