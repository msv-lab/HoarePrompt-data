Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `mid + 2`, `rightOne` is increased by 2**.

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` was already increased by 1 in the initial state. The code `trightOne += 1` increases `rightOne` by 1 again, making it increased by 2 in total. The values of `total` and `i` remain unchanged.
