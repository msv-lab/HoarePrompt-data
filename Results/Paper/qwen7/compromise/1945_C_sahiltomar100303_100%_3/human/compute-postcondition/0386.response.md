Output State: **`leftZero` is now `trightZero + rightZero - 1`, `left` is equal to `mid`, `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must hold true, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The line `leftZero -= 1` decrements the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `leftZero` was originally `trightZero + rightZero`, after decrementing, it becomes `trightZero + rightZero - 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
