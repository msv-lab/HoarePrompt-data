Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Loop Head Conditions
The loop condition is:
```python
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2):
```

This means the loop will continue as long as:
1. `left > 0`
2. Either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`

### Current States
- `left` is `mid - 3`
- `leftZero` is either `trightZero + rightZero - 1` or `trightZero + rightZero`
- `rightZero` is either `rightZero + 1` or `rightZero`
- `rightOne` is either `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` or `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1`

### Analysis
To determine which states need to be adjusted, let's analyze each part of the loop condition:

1. **Condition 1: `left > 0`**
   - The current value of `left` is `mid - 3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `mid - 3` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `mid` must be greater than 3.

2. **Condition 2: `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`**
   - We need to consider both parts of the OR condition separately.

   - **Part 1: `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2`**
     - The current value of `leftZero` is either `trightZero + rightZero - 1` or `trightZero + rightZero`.
     - We need to ensure that `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2`.
     - Since `left` is `mid - 3`, we need to check the values of `leftZero` based on the possible values of `trightZero` and `rightZero`.

   - **Part 2: `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`**
     - The current value of `rightOne` is either `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` or `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1`.
     - We need to ensure that `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`.
     - Since `left` is `mid - 3`, we need to check the values of `rightOne` based on the possible values of `n` and `left`.

### Adjusting States
- **Adjust `mid`:** To satisfy `left > 0`, `mid` must be greater than 3.
- **Adjust `leftZero`:** Ensure `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2`. Given `left = mid - 3`, we need to ensure `leftZero` is appropriately set.
- **Adjust `rightOne`:** Ensure `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`. Given `left = mid - 3`, we need to ensure `rightOne` is appropriately set.

### Final State
Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `mid` must be greater than 3.
- `leftZero` must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`.
- `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`left` is `mid - 3` where `mid` must be greater than 3, `leftZero` is either `trightZero + rightZero - 1` or `trightZero + rightZero` and must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is either `rightZero + 1` or `rightZero`, and `rightOne` is either `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` or `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1` and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`**
