Output State: **`left` is `mid - 4`, `leftZero` is either `trightZero + rightZero - 1` or `trightZero + rightZero` and must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is either `rightZero + 1` or `rightZero`, and `rightOne` is either `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` or `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1` and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Since `leftOne` was part of the initial conditions related to `left`, its decrement affects the calculation of `left`. Given that `left` was initially `mid - 3`, after decrementing `leftOne`, `left` becomes `mid - 4`. The other variables (`leftZero`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne`) remain unchanged as they were not directly affected by the operation.
