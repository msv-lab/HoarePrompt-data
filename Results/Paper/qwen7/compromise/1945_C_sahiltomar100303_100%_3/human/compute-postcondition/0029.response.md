Output State: **`tleftZero` is increased by 1, `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `rightZero`, `trightOne`, `leftOne` retain their original properties, `i` is `i_current + 1`.**

This means that the variable `leftZero` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `rightZero`, `trightOne`, `leftOne`) remain unchanged, and `i` is now `i_current + 1`.
