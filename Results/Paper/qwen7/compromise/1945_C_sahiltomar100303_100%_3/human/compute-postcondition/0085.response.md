Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus 1 or remains the same, `rightOne` is now `rightOne + 1` and is less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` and is less than `mid // 2`, and `rightOne` is now `rightOne + 1` and is less than `(n - (mid - 2) + 1) // 2`.**

This means that the value of `rightOne` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, with the conditions specified still holding true.
