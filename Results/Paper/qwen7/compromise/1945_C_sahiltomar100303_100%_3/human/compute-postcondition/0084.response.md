Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus 1 or remains the same, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` and is less than `mid // 2`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - (mid - 2) + 1) // 2` and is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `leftOne -= 1` decreases the value of `leftOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
