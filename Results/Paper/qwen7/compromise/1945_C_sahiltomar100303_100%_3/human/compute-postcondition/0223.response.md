Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is the total count of '0's from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total count of '1's from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's from index `0` to `mid-1`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's from index `0` to `mid-1`, `s` is the input string, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0.**

The code `leftMove = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `leftMove`. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
