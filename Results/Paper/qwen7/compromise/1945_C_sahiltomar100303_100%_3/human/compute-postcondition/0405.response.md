Output State: **`left` is `mid - 3`, `leftZero` is either `trightZero + rightZero - 2` or `trightZero + rightZero - 1`, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`, and `rightOne` is either `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` or `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1` and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code increments `rightZero` by 1. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only updated variable is `rightZero`, which is now one more than its previous value.
