Output State: **`left` is `mid - 4`, `leftZero` is either `trightZero + rightZero - 1` or `trightZero + rightZero` and must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`, `rightZero` is either `rightZero + 1` or `rightZero`, `rightOne` is either `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` or `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1` and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `rightOne` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
