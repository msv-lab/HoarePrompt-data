Output State: **`tleftZero` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0.**

The code `trightZero = 0` initializes `trightZero` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
