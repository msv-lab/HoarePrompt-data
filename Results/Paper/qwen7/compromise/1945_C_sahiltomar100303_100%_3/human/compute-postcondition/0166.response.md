Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value, `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', `right` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `rightZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `trightZero` is 0.**

The line `trightZero = 0` sets `trightZero` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
