Postcondition: `total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1 (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `tleftZero` is 3 if `s[right]` is '0' and 2 if `s[right]` is '1', `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(right + 1) // 2`, and `left` is equal to 0. This holds whether `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or less than `(n + 1) // 2`.
