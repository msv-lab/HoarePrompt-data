Postcondition: `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `x` is the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])` if any comparisons were made, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.
