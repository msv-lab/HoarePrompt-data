Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `kq1` is either 'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' or '0', `kq2` is either 'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' or 'x', `vt` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` is either `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` or `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is either `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` or `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` if `vt` equals 0. Otherwise, `kq1` is "y", `kq2` is "x", `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `kq1` and `kq2` are strings. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` is either `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0])) + a[1]` or `0 + a[1]`, and `kq2` is either `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0])) + a[2]` or `x + a[2]`. Otherwise, `kq1` is either `'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' concatenated with `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))` or `'0' concatenated with `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`, and `kq2` is either `'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' concatenated with `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))` or `'x' concatenated with `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`. `vt` remains 1, `i` becomes 3 if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise `i` becomes 2. `x` and `y` are updated accordingly based on the conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is a string that includes either the string representation of `x` or `y` (depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`) appended to it, and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representation of the other number appended to it, and `a[i]` retains its original value, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop if the condition `a[i] == b[i]` is false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
