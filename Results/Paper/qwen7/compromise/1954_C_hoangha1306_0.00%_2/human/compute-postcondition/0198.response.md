Output State: **`kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with `str(x)`, `kq2` is a string with `str(y)` appended, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `i` is `i + 1`, `vt` is 1.**

Explanation: The code appends `str(y)` to `kq2`. Since `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq2` now includes this new value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
