Output State: **`kq1` is `a[i]`, `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `kq2` is `a[i]` concatenated with the previous value of `kq2`, `vt` is 0, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, all the variables retain their previous values and conditions. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
