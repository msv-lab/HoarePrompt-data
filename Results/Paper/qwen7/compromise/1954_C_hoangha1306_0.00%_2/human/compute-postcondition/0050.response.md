Postcondition: **`kq1` and `kq2` are strings. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, then `kq1` is either `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0])) + a[1]` or `0 + a[1]`, and `kq2` is either `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0])) + a[2]` or `x + a[2]`. Otherwise, `kq1` is either `'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' concatenated with `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))` or `'0' concatenated with `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`, and `kq2` is either `'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' concatenated with `max(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))` or `'x' concatenated with `min(int(a[1]), int(b[1]))`. `vt` remains 1, `i` becomes 3 if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, otherwise `i` becomes 2. `x` and `y` are updated accordingly based on the conditions.**
