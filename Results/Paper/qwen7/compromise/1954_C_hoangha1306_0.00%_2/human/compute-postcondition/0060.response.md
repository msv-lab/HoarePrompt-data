Output State: **`vt` is 1, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` concatenates the string representation of `x` to `kq2`. The values of `vt`, `x`, `y`, and `kq1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
