Postcondition: `kq1` is a string that includes either the string representation of the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` or the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` (depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`) appended to it, and `kq2` is a string that includes the string representation of the other number appended to it.
