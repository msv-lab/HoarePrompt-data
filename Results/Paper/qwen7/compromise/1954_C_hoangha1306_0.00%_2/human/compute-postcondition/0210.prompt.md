Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an input string, `b` is the new input string, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, and `x` is the smaller of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])` if any comparisons were made.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `kq1` and `kq2` are strings, `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `vt` is 0, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` is `a[i]` and `kq2` is `a[i]` concatenated with the previous value of `kq2`. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `kq1` is the string representation of `x` without its last character, and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `kq1` and `kq2` are strings. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then both `kq1` and `kq2` are concatenated with `a[i]`. Otherwise, if `vt` is 0, `kq1` is concatenated with either `str(int(a[i+1]))` or `str(y)`, and `kq2` is concatenated with either `str(y)` or `str(x)`. If `vt` is 1, `kq1` is concatenated with the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the value of `x`. Both `i` is less than `len(a)`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `kq1` is a string that concatenates either the character `a[i]` or the string representation of `x` or `y` depending on the comparison between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. `kq2` is a string that concatenates either the string representation of `y` or `x` depending on the same comparison. If `vt != 0`, `kq1` is further concatenated with `str(y)` and `kq2` with `str(x)`. `a` and `b` remain as input strings, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` and `b` remain as input strings, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, and `i` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
