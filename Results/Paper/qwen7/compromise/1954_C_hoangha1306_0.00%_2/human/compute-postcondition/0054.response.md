Output State: **`kq2` is now the value of `kq2 + a[i]`, and `a[i]` retains its original value, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to `kq2` or `a[i]` within the loop body before the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from their previous states.
