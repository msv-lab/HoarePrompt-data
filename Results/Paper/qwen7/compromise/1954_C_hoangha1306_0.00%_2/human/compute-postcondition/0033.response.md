Postcondition: **`kq1` is either 'min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' or '0', `kq2` is either 'max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))' or 'x', `vt` is 1, `i` is 0, `x` is either `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` or `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is either `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` or `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))` if `vt` equals 0. Otherwise, `kq1` is "y", `kq2` is "x", `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is `min(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`, and `y` is `max(int(a[0]), int(b[0]))`**.

This means that after the if-else block executes:
- `kq1` will be either the minimum of the first elements of arrays `a` and `b` (converted to integers) or 0.
- `kq2` will be either the maximum of the first elements of arrays `a` and `b` (converted to integers) or some variable `x`.
- `vt` will be 1.
- `i` will be 0.
- `x` will be either the minimum or the maximum of the first elements of arrays `a` and `b` (converted to integers).
- `y` will be the opposite of `x` (either the maximum or the minimum of the first elements of arrays `a` and `b` converted to integers), unless `vt` is 0, in which case `kq1` will be `y` and `kq2` will be `x`, with `vt` being 0, `i` being 0, `x` being the minimum, and `y` being the maximum.
