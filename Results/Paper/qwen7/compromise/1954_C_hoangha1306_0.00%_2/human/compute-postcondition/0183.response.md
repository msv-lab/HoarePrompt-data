Postcondition: `kq1` is the concatenation of `kq1` with either `str(int(a[i]))` or `str(y)` depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`. Similarly, `kq2` is the concatenation of `kq2` with either `str(y)` or `str(x)` depending on the same condition. `i` is still less than `len(a)`, `a` and `b` remain as input strings, `vt` is 1, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, and `x` and `y` are the minimum and maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])` respectively.
