Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is less than `len(a)`.

3. **Update the state based on the loop head variables**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < len(a)`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should be updated to `i + 1`.

4. **Other states remain unchanged**:
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `b` remains the same.
   - `kq1` and `kq2` remain the same unless they are modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they do not change.
   - `q` remains `t`.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `x` and `y` remain the same unless they are modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume they do not change.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`kq1` is a string, `kq2` is a string, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `q` is `t`, `t` remains unchanged, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i+1])` and `int(b[i+1])`, `i` is `i + 1`**
