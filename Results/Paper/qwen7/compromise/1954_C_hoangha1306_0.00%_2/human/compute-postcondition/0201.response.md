Postcondition: `kq1` is a string that concatenates either the string representation of `x` (if `a[i] > b[i]`) or the string representation of `y` (if `a[i] <= b[i]`); `kq2` is a string that concatenates either the string representation of `y` (if `a[i] > b[i]`) or the string representation of `x` (if `a[i] <= b[i]`); `a` is an input string; `b` is an input string; `q` is `t`; `t` remains unchanged; `a` is an input string; `b` is an input string; `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`; `i` is `i + 1`; `vt` is 1.
