Postcondition: `x` is the minimum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[i])` and `int(b[i])`, `kq1` is a string that includes either `str(x)` or `str(y)` appended to it depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, and `kq2` is a string that includes the other number's string representation appended to it.
