Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the expression `range(int(input()))`. This means that the loop will iterate based on the input value obtained from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The variable `_` is used as a throwaway variable in the loop, meaning its specific value is not important for the loop itself. However, the loop will execute as long as the input value is a non-negative integer.
   - The state before the loop starts mentions that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). Since the loop will run for each input value provided by `int(input())`, the key state to adjust is the input value itself.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure that the input value provided to `int(input())` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), because this will determine how many times the loop will execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that will be read by `int(input())`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and the input value provided to `int(input())` must be within this range**
