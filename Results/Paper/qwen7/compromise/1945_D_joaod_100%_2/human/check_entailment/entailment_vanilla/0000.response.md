Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`pos_final`).
   - It then reads two lists of integers: `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The indices are adjusted by subtracting 1 from both `na_frente` and `pos_final`. This adjustment is necessary because the original problem statement uses 1-based indexing, while Python uses 0-based indexing.

3. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `total` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the cumulative cost.
   - A variable `best` is initialized to a very large value (`sys.float_info.max`) to store the minimum cost found.

4. **Loop through Positions:**
   - The loop iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0.
   - For each position `v`, it checks if `v` is within the allowed range (`v <= pos_final`).
     - If `v` is within the allowed range, it updates `best` if the current `total` plus the cost of swapping (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current `best`.
     - It then adds the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
   - If `v` is not within the allowed range, it simply adds the cost of passing (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) to `total`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `best`, which represents the minimum cost.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The index adjustment by subtracting 1 is correct since the problem uses 1-based indexing.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the minimum cost is correct. It correctly considers whether it is cheaper to swap or pass and updates the `best` cost accordingly.

3. **Backward Loop:**
   - The backward loop ensures that we consider all possible positions for Kirill to move to, starting from the last person in the queue.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where Kirill might need to pass through multiple people to reach his desired position.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
