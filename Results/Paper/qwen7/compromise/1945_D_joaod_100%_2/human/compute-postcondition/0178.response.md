Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is the sum of the minimum costs from either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b` for each iteration.
- `na_frente` is reduced to 0.
- `v` is -1.
- `best` is the maximum value found during the iterations.

The `print(best)` statement will print the value of `best`, which is described as the maximum value found during the iterations.

Output: **best (where best is the maximum value found during the iterations)**
