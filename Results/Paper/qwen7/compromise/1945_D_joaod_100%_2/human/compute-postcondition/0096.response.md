Postcondition: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `best` is the minimum cumulative cost considering either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` based on which is smaller, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `total` is the new cumulative cost which is the previous `total` plus the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `v` is an integer within the bounds of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` and is decreased by 1.**
