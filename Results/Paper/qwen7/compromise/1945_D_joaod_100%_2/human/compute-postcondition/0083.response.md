Postcondition: `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input split by spaces, `best` is set to `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `total` is 0, and `v` is an index such that `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
