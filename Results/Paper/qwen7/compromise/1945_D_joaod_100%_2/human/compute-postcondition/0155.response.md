Output State: **`total` is now `total + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`, `na_frente` remains its initial value, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `best` is unchanged if `best` is not greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `best` is now equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value. The other variables (`na_frente`, `v`, and `best`) remain unchanged from their initial states as per the precondition.
