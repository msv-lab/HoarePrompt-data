Output State: **`total` is 0; `cases` must be greater than 0; `c` is 0; `na_frente` is `na_frente`; `pos_final` is `pos_final`; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers; `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers; `best` is now `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`; `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`; `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`**.

This means that the value of `best` has been updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
