Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0; `c` is 0; `na_frente` is an input integer; `pos_final` is an input integer; `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.**

The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The other variables (`cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, and `pos_final`) remain unchanged.
