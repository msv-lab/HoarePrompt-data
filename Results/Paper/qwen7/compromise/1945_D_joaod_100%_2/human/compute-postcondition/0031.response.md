Output State: **`total` is 0 + `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente`, `pos_final` is `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `best` is set to the maximum float value, `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

This means that the `total` variable has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value (which was 0), while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
