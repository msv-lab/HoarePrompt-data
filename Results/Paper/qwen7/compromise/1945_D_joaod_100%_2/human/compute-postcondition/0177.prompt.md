Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 2`, `pos_final` is `pos_final - 1`, `best` is the maximum float value, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent input split and converted to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the current input split and converted to integers.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total` is either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, depending on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `na_frente` remains its initial value, `v` is `na_frente`, and `best` is updated to the maximum of the two possible values: `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, then `total` is reset to 0, `best` is unchanged, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `total` is either `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`, depending on which is smaller; `na_frente` remains its initial value; `v` is `na_frente - 1`; `best` is unchanged if neither branch updates it, otherwise `best` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final`, or to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `v > pos_final`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `total`, `na_frente`, `v`, and `best` are as follows: `total` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, depending on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. `na_frente` remains its initial value, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, and `best` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final`, or to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` if `v > pos_final`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
