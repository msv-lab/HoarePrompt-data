Output State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input split by spaces, `best` remains unchanged, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer decreased by 1, `total` is 0.**

In this case, the code initializes the variable `total` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `best`, `cases`, `pos_final`, and `na_frente` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `c` also remains 0.
