Output State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, and `v` is an integer within the bounds of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` and is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `best` to be the sum of `total` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
