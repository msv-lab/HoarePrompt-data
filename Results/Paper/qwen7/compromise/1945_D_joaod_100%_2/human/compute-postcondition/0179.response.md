Output State: **All iterations of the loop have completed, and the final value of `best` is printed.**

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `best` will hold the minimum total cost calculated across all cases. This value is determined by iteratively choosing the cheaper option between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each `v` in the range from `na_frente` to -1, and updating `total` accordingly. The final value of `best` is then printed, representing the optimal solution for the given case. All other variables (`cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged from their last known state after the loop completes.
