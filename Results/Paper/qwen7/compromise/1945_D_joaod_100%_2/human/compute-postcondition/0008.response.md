Output State: **`total` is 0, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente` - 1, `pos_final` is `pos_final` - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from another input split and mapped to integers, `best` is set to the maximum float value.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `best` to the maximum floating-point value using `sys.float_info.max`. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `total`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.
