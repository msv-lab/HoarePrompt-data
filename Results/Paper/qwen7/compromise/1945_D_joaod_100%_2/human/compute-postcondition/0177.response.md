Output State: **`total` is the sum of the minimum costs from either `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `custo_pra_passar_b` for each iteration, `na_frente` is reduced to 0, `v` is -1, and `best` is the maximum value found during the iterations.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `na_frente` will be reduced to 0 since the loop starts from `na_frente` and decrements `v` until it reaches -1. The variable `v` will be -1 because the loop continues decrementing `v` from `na_frente` down to 0. The `total` variable accumulates the minimum cost at each step, either from `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, depending on which is smaller. The `best` variable keeps track of the highest accumulated `total` value found during the loop's execution, ensuring it is updated whenever a new maximum is encountered based on the conditions provided.
