Output State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `best` is the minimum cumulative cost considering either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` based on which is smaller, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, and `v` is an integer within the bounds of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` and is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to `total`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `c` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` because `c` was previously 0.
