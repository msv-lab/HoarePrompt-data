Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from the input, which is assigned to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` but does not affect the values of `t` or the array `a`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer within the range [1, 10^4], and the array `a` remains a list of `n` integers, each within the range [1, n].
