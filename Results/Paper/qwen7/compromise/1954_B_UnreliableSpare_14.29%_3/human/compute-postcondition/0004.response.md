Output State: `flag` is `False`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and `arr` is a list of n integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.

Explanation: The loop checks if each element in the array `arr` is different from its previous element. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. Therefore, if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements that are different, `flag` will be `False` after the loop completes. If all elements are the same, `flag` will remain `True`.
