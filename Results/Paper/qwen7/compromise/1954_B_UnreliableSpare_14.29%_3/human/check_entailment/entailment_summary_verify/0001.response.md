### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a "beautiful" array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array allows for the replacement of an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already beautiful (all elements are the same).
   - If the array is beautiful, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program uses a flag to check if the array is already beautiful. This is done by comparing adjacent elements.
   - If the array is not beautiful, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove by counting the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and using this count to determine the necessary removals needed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the array is already beautiful correctly by printing `-1`.
   - However, there is a logical flaw in the calculation of the minimum number of removals. The current logic only considers the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements but does not account for the possibility of removing elements in a way that breaks the beauty condition without necessarily removing the maximum number of elements.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case and performs the necessary checks and calculations.
   - The use of `Decimal` for `ans` is unnecessary and can be replaced with an integer or float for simplicity.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies whether the array is already beautiful.
   - However, the logic for calculating the minimum number of removals is flawed. Consider the following counterexample:
     - Input: `5 1 2 1 2 1`
     - Expected Output: `1`
     - Current Program Output: `1` (Correct)
     - But consider another input: `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
     - Expected Output: `3`
     - Current Program Output: `3` (Correct)
     - However, the program does not handle cases where multiple sequences of identical elements exist and removing fewer elements can break the beauty condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program is not entirely correct because it does not always calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition. It only considers the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements, which may not always yield the optimal solution.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
