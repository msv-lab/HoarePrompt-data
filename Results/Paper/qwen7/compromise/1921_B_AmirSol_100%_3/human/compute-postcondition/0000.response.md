Output State: **`cats_to_add` is the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1' for `i` in the range of `n`. `n` is a positive integer, and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'.**

This means that `cats_to_add` is calculated as the count of indices where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1' for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.
