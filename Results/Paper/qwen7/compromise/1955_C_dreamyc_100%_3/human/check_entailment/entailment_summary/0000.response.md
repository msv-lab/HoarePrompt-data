Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating how many ships would sink based on the given attack pattern. However, the logic within the `func_1` function does not correctly simulate the attack process described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation**: The function calculates the sum of the first `i+1` elements and the last `i+1` elements of the list `nums` to determine if they should be counted towards the number of ships that sink. This approach does not accurately reflect the sinking process because it does not account for the reduction in the number of ships over time as some ships sink.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Sinking Ships**: The function checks if the sum of the first `i+1` elements is less than or equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)` and the sum of the last `i+1` elements is less than or equal to `k // 2`. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the actual sinking process where ships are removed from the list as they are attacked and sink.

3. **Attack Pattern Not Simulated**: The function does not simulate the alternating attack pattern of the Kraken (first ship, then last ship, and so on) and does not reduce the number of ships as they sink.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly simulate the problem's requirements and will not produce the correct number of ships sunk.

Correctness: **False**
