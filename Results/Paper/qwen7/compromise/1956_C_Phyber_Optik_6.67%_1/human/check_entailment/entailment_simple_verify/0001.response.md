### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Understanding:
- We have an \(n \times n\) matrix initialized to zero.
- We can perform up to \(2n\) operations, each of which can either permute the rows or columns.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix.

#### Given Solution Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Calculating Sum and Number of Operations**:
   - For each test case, it calculates the sum of the matrix and the number of operations required.
   - The sum is calculated as the sum of the first \(i \times n\) elements for the first \(r\) rows, where \(r\) is determined such that \(n \times (n + 1) / 2 > i \times n\).
   - The number of operations is \(n + r\), where \(r\) is the number of full rows plus one additional row.

3. **Generating Operations**:
   - The operations are printed in the form specified, alternating between row and column permutations until the required number of operations is reached.

#### Detailed Breakdown:
- **Sum Calculation**:
  - The sum calculation seems to be incorrect. The logic to determine \(r\) and the sum is flawed. Specifically, the condition \(n \times (n + 1) / 2 > i \times n\) is not relevant to the problem. Instead, we should aim to fill the matrix with the largest possible values in a way that maximizes the sum.
  
- **Number of Operations**:
  - The number of operations \(n + r\) is also incorrect. The correct approach should involve filling the matrix with the largest possible values in a structured manner, which typically requires fewer operations.

- **Operations Generation**:
  - The operations generated do not seem to follow the problem's requirements. The operations should be designed to fill the matrix with the largest possible values, which is not achieved by simply permuting rows and columns in the given manner.

#### Correct Approach:
- To maximize the sum, we should fill the matrix with the largest possible values. This can be done by setting the first \(n\) elements of each row to the largest values in a structured manner.
- For example, for \(n = 2\):
  - We can set the first row to \([2, 1]\) and the second row to \([1, 2]\). This gives us a sum of \(2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6\).

- For \(n = 3\):
  - We can set the first row to \([3, 2, 1]\), the second row to \([2, 3, 1]\), and the third row to \([1, 2, 3]\). This gives us a sum of \(3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 18\).

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix. The sum calculation and the number of operations are incorrect. The operations generated do not achieve the desired result.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
