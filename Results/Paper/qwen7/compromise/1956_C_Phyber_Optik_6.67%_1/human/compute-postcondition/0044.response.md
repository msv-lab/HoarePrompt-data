Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is known.
   - `r` is known.
   - `sum` remains 0 if `j` is still less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is incremented by 1 (let's assume it was `j-1` before increment).
   - Therefore, `j` is now `j`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `r` remains the same.
   - `sum` remains 0 if `j` is still less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + r + 1`.
   - Since `j` is currently `j`, the loop will continue as long as `j < n + r + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - We need to update `j` to `j + 1` for the next iteration.
   - `n` and `r` remain unchanged.
   - `sum` remains 0 if `j` is still less than or equal to `n + r`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `n` is known, `r` is known, and `sum` remains 0 if `j + 1` is still less than or equal to `n + r`**.
