Output State: **`j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is 0, `t` is `t - n * n`, `i` is `n`, `sum` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes `sum` to 0 and sets `r` to 0. It does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, `t`, `i`, or their relationships. Therefore, the values of `j`, `n`, `t`, `i` remain unchanged, while `r` is explicitly set to 0 and `sum` is initialized to 0.
