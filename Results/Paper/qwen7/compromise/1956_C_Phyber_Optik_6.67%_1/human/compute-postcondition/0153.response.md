Output State: j = 3 * n + 3, n = initial n, r = 3, sum = 3 * n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2.

After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `j` will be `3 * n + 3`, as it increments by `1` in each iteration of the loop. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop iterations. The value of `r` is set to `3` after the third iteration. The value of `sum` is calculated as `3 * n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`, which represents the sum accumulated over all three iterations of the loop.
