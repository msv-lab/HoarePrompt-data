Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The value of `sum` will be the sum of `i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, plus `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. The variable `r` will be set to `n`, `j` will be `n + r + 2` which simplifies to `2n + 2`, `t` will be `t - n`, and `i` will be `n` after the loop completes. The variable `n` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

In simpler terms, the final value of `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each `i` up to `n` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n`. The variable `r` will be `n`, `j` will be `2n + 2`, `t` will be reduced by `n`, and `i` will be `n`. The variable `n` will stay the same as no operations modify it.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    if j <= n:
        print(1, j, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
    else:
        print(2, j % n, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `t` is some initial value, `i` is some initial value, `r` is some initial value, and either `j` is less than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 2, `n` is at least 1, and `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 3 and `n` is at least 2. Regardless of the condition `j <= n`, the values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
