Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.
- `t`, `i`, and `r` have some initial values, but these are not relevant to the print statement.
- The current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

This statement will print the integer 1, followed by the value of `j`, which is 1, with no newline character at the end due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **1 1**
