Based on the initial state provided and the code snippet, let's analyze the variables and their values step by step.

### Initial State:
- `j` is 2.
- `n` is at least 1.
- `r` is some initial value.
- The condition `j` is less than or equal to `n + r` holds true for the loop to continue.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Value to Print**: The first value printed is `2`. This is explicitly stated in the code.
   
2. **Second Value to Print**: The second value to print is `j % n`. Here, `j` is 2 and `n` is at least 1. The modulo operation `2 % n` depends on the value of `n`:
   - If `n` is 1, then `2 % 1` is 0.
   - If `n` is 2, then `2 % 2` is 0.
   - If `n` is 3, then `2 % 3` is 2.
   - And so on...

Since `n` is at least 1, the result of `2 % n` will always be a value between 0 and `n-1`.

### Conclusion:
Given that `n` is at least 1, the second value printed will be `2 % n`, which will be a value between 0 and `n-1`.

### Output:
Output: **2 0 (if n is 1), 2 0 (if n is 2), 2 2 (if n is 3), ... (depending on the value of n)**
