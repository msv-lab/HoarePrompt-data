Output State: `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` added once and `i * n` added for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The value of `r` is `n`, and `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes, but since `i` is not used outside the loop, we can ignore its final value. `n` remains unchanged.

To break it down:
- `sum` accumulates `n * (n + 1) // 2` once and then adds `i * n` for each iteration from 1 to `n`.
- `r` is set to `i` when the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` fails for the last time, which happens when `i = n`.
- After the loop, `i` increments to `n + 1`, but this does not affect the output state since `i` is not used outside the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2 + n * n`, `r` is `n`, and `n` remains as the initial input integer.
