Output State: **`j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is 0, `t` is `t - n * n`, `i` is 2, `sum` is `i * n`.**

Explanation: The code `sum += i * n` increments the value of `sum` by `i * n`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `sum` is updated to `1 * n`, making `sum` equal to `n`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. All other variables (`j`, `r`, `t`, and the condition involving `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
