Output State: `j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` must still be at least 1, `r` is either `i` or 3, `t` remains `t - n * n`, and `sum` is updated to `sum + 3 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `j` remains unchanged at `2 * n + 2`.
- The variable `n` will have been decremented to 0 (since the loop runs from `1` to `n` inclusive, and `n` starts as an input integer which gets reduced by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0).
- The variable `r` will be either `i` or `3`, depending on the value of `i` in the last iteration.
- The variable `t` decreases by `n * n` for each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `sum` accumulates the value `3 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If the condition is not met, it simply adds `3 * n` to `sum`.
