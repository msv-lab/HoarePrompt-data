Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The final value of `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` added to `i * n` for each iteration from 1 to `n`, and `r` will be set to the last value of `i` which satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. If no such `i` exists, `r` will be set to the last value of `i`.

In simpler terms, `sum` accumulates the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` as long as it is greater than the current `i * n`, otherwise it adds `i * n`. The variable `r` keeps track of the largest `i` for which the condition holds true during the loop's execution. If the condition never holds, `r` will be set to the last value of `i` which means `n`.

This output state describes the final values of `sum` and `r` after the loop has completed all its iterations based on the given conditions.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    if j <= n:
        print(1, j, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
    else:
        print(2, j % n, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j`, `n`, `r`, and `sum` are known. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the postcondition remains as `j` is 1, `n` is known, `r` is known, and `sum` is 0. If `j` is greater than `n`, the postcondition also remains as `j` is 1, `n` is known, `r` is known, and `sum` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is incremented by 1, `n` is known, `r` is known, and `sum` remains 0 if `j` is still less than or equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is `j + 1`, `n` is known, `r` is known, and `sum` remains 0 if `j + 1` is still less than or equal to `n + r`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
