Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sum` is either `2 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` or `2 * n + 2 * n` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`.
   - `r` is either 1 or 2.
   - `j` is either `n + 3` or `n + r + 2`.
   - `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `n + 1`, and there is no indication that `n` changes within the loop body.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `sum` remains unchanged.
   - `r` remains unchanged.
   - `j` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged (greater than or equal to 0).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`sum` is either `2 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` or `2 * n + 2 * n` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`, `r` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either `n + 3` or `n + r + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0.**
