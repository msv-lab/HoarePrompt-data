Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is at least 1
- `t`, `i`, and `r` have some initial values but are not relevant to the print statement
- `j` is greater than `n`

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Since `n` is at least 1, the range will start from 1 and go up to `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n**
