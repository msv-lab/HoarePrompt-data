Output State: **`sum` is either `2 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2 + 3 * n` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` or `2 * n + 2 * n + 3 * n` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`, `r` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either `n + 3` or `n + r + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The value of `sum` is updated by adding `i * n` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, `sum` is effectively increased by `3 * n`. The conditions for `sum` and the values of `r`, `j`, `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
