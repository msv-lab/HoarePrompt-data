Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines `j` as `2 * n + 2`.
2. It also states that `n` must be at least 1.
3. Another condition is that `r` must be at least `n + 1`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to but not including `n + 1`. Since `n` is at least 1, the range will start from 1 and go up to `n`.

Therefore, the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 ... n**
