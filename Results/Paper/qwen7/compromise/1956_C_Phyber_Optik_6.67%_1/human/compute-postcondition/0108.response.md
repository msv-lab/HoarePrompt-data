Output State: **`j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is `i`, `t` is `t - n * n`, `i` is 2, `sum` is 0, and the current value of `i` is less than `(n * (n + 1) // 2)` divided by `n`.**

Explanation: The code `r = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `r`. Initially, `i` is 1, so `r` is also set to 1. However, after executing `r = i`, `i` is incremented by 1 due to the postcondition that the current value of `i` is less than `(n * (n + 1) // 2) / n`. Therefore, `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given postconditions.
