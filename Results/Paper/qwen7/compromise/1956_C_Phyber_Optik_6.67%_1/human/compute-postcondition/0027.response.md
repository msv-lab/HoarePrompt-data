Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `j` which is initialized to 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n + r + 1`.
   - The loop also involves the variables `n` and `r`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop:**
   - For the loop to start, `j` must be initialized to 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + r + 1`.
   - Therefore, the initial value of `j` should be 1.
   - The values of `n` and `r` must be known to determine the upper limit of the loop.

3. **Final Values of `sum` and `r`:**
   - The final value of `sum` is determined by the loop's logic where `sum` accumulates the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` as long as it is greater than the current `i * n`, otherwise it adds `i * n`.
   - The variable `r` keeps track of the largest `i` for which the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` holds true during the loop's execution. If no such `i` exists, `r` will be set to the last value of `i`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - We need to ensure that `j` is initialized to 1.
   - The values of `n` and `r` must be known to determine the upper limit of the loop.
   - The final values of `sum` and `r` will be determined by the loop's execution, but we need to ensure the initial conditions are correct for the loop to start.

### Final Answer:

State: **`j` is 1, `n` is known, `r` is known, `sum` is 0**.

Explanation:
- `j` is initialized to 1 to start the loop.
- `n` and `r` are known values to determine the upper limit of the loop.
- `sum` is initialized to 0 as it accumulates the values during the loop execution.
