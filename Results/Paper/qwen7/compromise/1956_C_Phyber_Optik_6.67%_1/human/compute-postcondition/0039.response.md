Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `j + 1`, which means `j` has been incremented by 1.
- `n` is known but its value is not specified.
- `r` is known but its value is not specified.
- `sum` is 0 if `j` is still less than or equal to `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

Let's break it down:

1. **2**: This is a constant value and will be printed as is.
2. **j % n**: This computes the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`. Since `j` is `j + 1`, and `j` was previously less than or equal to `n`, after incrementing `j` by 1, `j` could either be equal to `n` or greater than `n`. If `j` is equal to `n`, then `j % n` would be 0. If `j` is greater than `n`, then `j % n` would be a positive number less than `n`.

Given these points, the output will depend on the value of `n` and whether `j` is exactly `n` or greater than `n`. However, since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe the value of `j % n` based on the conditions.

Output: **2, 0 (if j == n) or 2, [remainder of j divided by n] (if j > n)**
