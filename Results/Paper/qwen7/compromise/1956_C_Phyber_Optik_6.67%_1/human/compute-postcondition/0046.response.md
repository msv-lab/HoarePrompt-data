Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is set to `j + 1`
- `n` is known
- `r` is known
- `sum` remains 0 if `j + 1` is still less than or equal to `n + r`

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `j` is set to `j + 1`, it does not affect the range being printed by the `range(1, n + 1)` function. The `sum` variable is mentioned but it does not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Therefore, the output will be the numbers from 1 to `n` printed in sequence.

Output: **1 2 ... n**
