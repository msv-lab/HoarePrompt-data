Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has been incremented by 1, and `n` and `r` remain unchanged. The variable `sum` remains 0 as long as `j` is still less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + r`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` was incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `j` as `j_new = j + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `j_new` must be less than or equal to `n + r`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + r - 1` for the next iteration.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` is now `j + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `r` remains unchanged.
- `sum` remains 0 as long as `j` is still less than or equal to `n`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `j` is `j + 1`, `n` is known, `r` is known, and `sum` remains 0 if `j` is still less than or equal to `n + r - 1`.**
