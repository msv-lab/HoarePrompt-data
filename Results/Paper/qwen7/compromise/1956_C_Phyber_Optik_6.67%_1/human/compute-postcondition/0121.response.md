Output State: **`j` is 2 * n + 2, `n` must still be at least 1, `r` is `i`, `t` remains t - n * n, `sum` is updated to sum + 3 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The variable `sum` is updated by adding `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. The other variables (`j`, `n`, `r`, `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
