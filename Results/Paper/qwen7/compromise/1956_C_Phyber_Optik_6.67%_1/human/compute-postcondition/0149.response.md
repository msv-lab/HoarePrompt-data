The initial state does not provide a specific value for `n`. Therefore, we need to consider the general case where `n` is an integer.

The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive). When this range is unpacked using the starred expression (`*`), it is passed as separate arguments to the `print` function.

Given this, the output will be a series of numbers from 1 to `n`, each on a separate line.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of the variable n)**
