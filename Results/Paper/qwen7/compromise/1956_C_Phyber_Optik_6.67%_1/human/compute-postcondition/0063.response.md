Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or `i * n` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
   - `r` is either 1 or 0.
   - `j` is either `n + 3` or `n + r + 2`.
   - `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Analyze the loop increment**:
   - Since the loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`, `i` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is either 1 or 2.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.

If `i` is currently 1, after the next iteration, `i` will become 2.
If `i` is currently 2, the loop will terminate since `i` will exceed `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (if `i` is 1) will be:
- `i` becomes 2.
- `n` remains unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n` or `2 * n` when `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= 2 * n`, `r` is either 1 or 0, `j` is either `n + 3` or `n + r + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0.**

If `i` was already 2, the loop would terminate, and no further adjustments are needed.
