Based on the initial state provided:

- The value of `sum` is the sum of `i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, plus `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- The variable `r` is set to `n`.
- The variable `j` is `n + r + 2`, which simplifies to `2n + 2`.
- The variable `t` is reduced by `n`.
- The variable `i` is `n` after the loop completes.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged.

Given these conditions, let's break down the print statement:

- `sum`: This is the sum of `i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, plus `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. Since `n * (n + 1) // 2` grows faster than `i * n`, the term `n * (n + 1) // 2` will dominate the sum for smaller values of `i`. However, without a specific value for `n`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `sum`.
- `n + r`: Given that `r = n`, this expression simplifies to `2n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `sum` and `2n`.

Output: **sum, 2n**
