Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, where `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 remains valid, and a new condition for `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) is introduced, but since `n` is not yet assigned a value, it retains its precondition state.
