Based on the initial state provided, there are no variables or objects defined other than the `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function. The `print` function is simply printing the integer `1` followed by the variable `j` with a space as the separator due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Since `j` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the output will include the integer `1` followed by the value of `j`.

Output: **1 j**
