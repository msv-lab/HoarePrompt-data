Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `j` is `2 * n + 2`
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `r` is either `i` or 0
   - `t` is `t - n * n`
   - `i` is 2
   - `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition:**
   The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 3 if `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If `n` is 2, then `i` will reach `n + 1` (which is 3) and the loop will terminate.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

6. **Final State:**
   - `j` remains `2 * n + 2`.
   - `n` must still be at least 1.
   - `r` will be either `3` or `0` depending on the previous value of `i`.
   - `t` remains `t - n * n`.
   - `sum` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (3) and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`.

Given these points, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` must be at least 1, `r` is either `3` or `0`, `t` is `t - n * n`, `i` is `3`, and `sum` is either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `3 * n` depending on whether the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n` is true.**
