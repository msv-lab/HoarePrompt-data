You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` and `t` strings, each consisting of exactly 5 characters ('A' or 'B'), and counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in each string. It then prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters in the string; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently in a given string of length 5, where each character is either 'A' or 'B'. This needs to be done for multiple test cases.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

3. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program initializes counters `ac` and `bc` to zero. It then iterates over each character in the string, incrementing the appropriate counter (`ac` for 'A' and `bc` for 'B').

4. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', the program compares the two counts. If `ac` (the count of 'A') is greater than `bc` (the count of 'B'), it prints 'A'. Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all possible combinations of 'A' and 'B' in the string correctly. Since the string length is fixed at 5, the logic will always work as intended.

6. **Output Format**: The program outputs the result for each test case on a new line, which matches the required format.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
