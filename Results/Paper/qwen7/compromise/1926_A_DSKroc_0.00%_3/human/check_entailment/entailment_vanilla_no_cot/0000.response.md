Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine which letter (either 'A' or 'B') appears most frequently in a string of length 5 for each test case. The program initializes counters for 'A' (`ac`) and 'B' (`bc`), iterates through each character in the input string, and increments the appropriate counter. After processing the string, it compares the counts and prints the more frequent character. Given the constraints and the example provided, the program will produce the correct output for each test case.
