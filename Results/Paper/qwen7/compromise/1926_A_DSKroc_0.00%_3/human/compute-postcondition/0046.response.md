Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for q in range(t)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `q` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `ac` is an integer
   - `q` is 1
   - `bc` is an integer
   - `s` is an empty string
   - `i` does not exist

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `q` must be less than `t`. Currently, `q` is 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `q` needs to be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 0 in Python's `range` function). Therefore, `q` should be 2. Additionally, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Update the state**: Based on the above reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should include:
   - `ac` remains an integer
   - `q` is now 2
   - `bc` remains an integer
   - `s` remains an empty string
   - `i` still does not exist

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ac` is an integer, `q` is 2, `bc` is an integer, `s` is an empty string, and `i` does not exist**
