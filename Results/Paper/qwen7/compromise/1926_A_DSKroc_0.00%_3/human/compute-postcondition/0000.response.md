Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 32**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 32`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the code is executed. The other variables (`input` and the string characters) are not affected by this code.
