Output State: **`ac` is either 2 or 3, `q` is 2, `bc` is either 0 or 1, `s` is an input string that must have at least one character remaining**

Explanation: The value of `ac` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if it was initially 2, it becomes 3. The values of `q`, `bc`, and `s` remain unchanged.
