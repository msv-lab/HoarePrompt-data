Output State: **`ac` is an integer +1, `q` is 1, `bc` is an integer, `s` is a non-empty string (with the last character removed), `i` is the last character in the updated string `s`**.

Explanation: The value of `ac` is incremented by 1, making it `ac + 1`. The values of `q`, `bc`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
