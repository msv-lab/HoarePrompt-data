Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `q` must be 0, `ac` is 0, `bc` is 0**

The code initializes `bc` to 0. Since `t`, `q`, and `ac` were already defined with their respective conditions and values, they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `bc` and retains the original conditions for `t`, `q`, and `ac`.
