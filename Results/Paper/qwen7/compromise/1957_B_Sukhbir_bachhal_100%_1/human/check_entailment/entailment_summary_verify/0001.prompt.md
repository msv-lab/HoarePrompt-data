You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 10^4 (inclusive). If `n` is 0, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it repeatedly divides `n` by 2 until `n` becomes 0, counting the number of divisions. After the loop, the function returns the count minus 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program proceeds to generate a sequence.
   - If `n` is 1, the program simply prints `k`.

3. **Generating the Sequence**:
   - When `n > 1`, the program uses the function `func_1(k)` to determine the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - It then constructs the sequence as follows:
     - Adds `(2 ** counter - 1)` to the array. This is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the `counter`-th bit.
     - Adds `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to the array. This ensures the sum of the sequence is `k`.
     - Fills the rest of the array with zeros to make the length `n`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(n)` finds the position of the highest set bit in `n`.
   - It returns `position - 1` which is the index of the highest set bit minus one.

### Verification:

1. **Sum Constraint**:
   - The sum of the sequence should be `k`. The sequence `[2 ** counter - 1, k - (2 ** counter - 1)]` sums to `k` because `(2 ** counter - 1) + (k - (2 ** counter - 1)) = k`.

2. **Binary OR Operation**:
   - The bitwise OR of `(2 ** counter - 1)` and `(k - (2 ** counter - 1))` will have as many 1s as possible within the constraints of `k`.
   - Adding zeros at the end of the sequence does not affect the OR operation since zero has no bits set.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n = 1`, the program correctly prints `k` because there is only one element in the sequence.
   - When `n > 1`, the constructed sequence meets both the sum and the OR operation criteria.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement. It generates a sequence that satisfies both the sum condition and the maximum number of 1s in the binary OR operation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
