Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and returns the highest bit position set in `n` minus one. This is achieved by repeatedly shifting `n` right until it becomes zero, counting the shifts.
   - If `n` is zero, the function returns `-1`, indicating no bits are set.
   - For any other positive integer `n`, the function correctly calculates the highest bit position and returns it minus one.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program processes `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n > 1`, it calls `func_1(k)` to get the highest bit position `counter` in `k`.
   - It constructs the array `arr` with:
     - The first element as `2 ** counter - 1` (a number with all bits set to 1 up to the `counter`-th bit).
     - The second element as `k - (2 ** counter - 1)`.
     - The remaining elements as `0`.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The approach ensures that the sum of the elements in `arr` equals `k`.
   - The bitwise OR of the elements in `arr` will have as many 1s as possible because `2 ** counter - 1` sets all bits up to the `counter`-th bit, and the remaining part (`k - (2 ** counter - 1)`) ensures the total sum is `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n == 1`, the solution is straightforward and correct.
   - When `n > 1`, the constructed array meets both conditions: the sum of the elements equals `k`, and the bitwise OR of the elements has the maximum number of 1s possible under the given constraints.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to satisfy the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
