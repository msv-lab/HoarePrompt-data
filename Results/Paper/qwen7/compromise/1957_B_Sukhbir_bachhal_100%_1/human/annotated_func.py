#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and n is not equal to 0. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `position` is 5, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is 0, `k` is an integer satisfying \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. Each iteration of the loop performs two operations: `n >>= 1` (which means `n` is divided by 2 and truncated towards zero) and `position += 1`. Given that `n` becomes 0 after the third iteration, it implies that `n` was initially a power of 2 greater than or equal to 2^4 (since `n` became 0 after 4 divisions). Therefore, after 4 iterations, `position` will be 5, and `n` will be 0. The value of `t` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns 4
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 10^4 (inclusive). If `n` is 0, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it repeatedly divides `n` by 2 until `n` becomes 0, counting the number of divisions. After the loop, the function returns the count minus 1.
