Output State: **`position` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `position` right-shifted by 1 bit, and `k` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9**.

Explanation: The code `position += 1` increments the value of `position` by 1. Initially, `position` is 0, so after executing this line, `position` becomes 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains `position` right-shifted by 1 bit (which is now 1), and `k` remains an integer satisfying 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
