You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is `False`, `i` is `0`, `m` is an integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ n`, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input after all iterations of the loop have completed.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be decremented until it reaches 0. The loop continues to run for each value of `m` from `n` down to 1. If at any point during these iterations, the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met and the concatenated number is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Given the provided conditions, `ans` remains `False` throughout all iterations unless the condition is never met, which is not specified in the problem statement. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 0, `ans` will be `False`, and `m` will be the smallest value it was set to during the loop, which is at least 1 and at most `n`. The value of `arr[i-1]` will be the first digit of the number formed by concatenating `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` if the condition was met, but since `ans` is `False`, this condition was not met for any `i`, so `arr[i-1]` retains its value from the last iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the array can be made sorted by repeatedly applying the operation to elements that are at least 10. The program checks if the current element is less than the previous element and then attempts to split the previous element, but it does not ensure that the resulting array is sorted after each operation. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program will check the elements from the end to the beginning. When it reaches `67` and compares it with `45`, it will fail because `67 > 45`. However, the correct approach would be to split `45` into `[4, 5]` and then compare the new array `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`. This new array can be sorted by further splitting and rearranging elements.

The program does not account for the possibility of making the array sorted through multiple operations, and it incorrectly returns `NO` for this case. Therefore, the program is not correct.
