Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be at least 3, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and the current state of `nums` is not sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within the given code snippet, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
