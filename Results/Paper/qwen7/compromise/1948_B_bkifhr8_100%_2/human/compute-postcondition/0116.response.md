Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99), and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 represents the number of such test cases. For each test case, it returns a result based on the processed input.**
