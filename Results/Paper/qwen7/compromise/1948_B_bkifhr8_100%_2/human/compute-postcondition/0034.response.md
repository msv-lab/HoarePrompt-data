Postcondition: `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`, `i` is `i - 1`, and `m` remains the same. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` remains `False`; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged as `False`.
