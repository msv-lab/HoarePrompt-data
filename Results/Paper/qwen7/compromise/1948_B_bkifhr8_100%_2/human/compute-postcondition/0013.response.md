Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the integer value of the last element of `arr` before the index `i` and the current value of `arr[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
