Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `nums[0]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `ans`. The values of `i`, `m`, `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
