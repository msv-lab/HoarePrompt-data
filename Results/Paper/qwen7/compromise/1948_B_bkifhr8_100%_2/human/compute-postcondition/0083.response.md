Output State: **`ans` is `True`, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be at least 3, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code converts the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` into a list of integers and appends the integer value of `arr[i]` to it. Since `arr[i - 1]` is a number, its string representation is converted to a list of its digits, and then `arr[i]` is appended to this list. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
