Output State: `ans` is either True or False, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than 1, and `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `m - 1` because the loop decrements `i` from `m - 1` down to 1. The loop checks each element `arr[i]` against `arr[i - 1]` and updates `arr[i - 1]` based on certain conditions. If at any point `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. If no such condition is met throughout the entire loop, `ans` remains `True`. Therefore, the final state of `ans` depends on whether the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` was ever true during the loop's execution.
