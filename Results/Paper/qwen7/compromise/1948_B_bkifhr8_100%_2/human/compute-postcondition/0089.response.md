Postcondition: `ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be at least 3, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement because the list `nums` is not sorted.
