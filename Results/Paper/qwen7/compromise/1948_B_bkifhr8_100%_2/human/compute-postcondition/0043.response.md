State: **`ans` is True, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.
2. The loop condition `i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)` means that `i` should iterate from `m-1` down to 1 (inclusive).
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `m-1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which implies `m` must be greater than 1.
4. The variable `ans` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being 0 and `m` being greater than 1.
