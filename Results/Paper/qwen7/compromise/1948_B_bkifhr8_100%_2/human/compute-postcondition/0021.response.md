Output State: **`nums` is a list containing integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`; `ans` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the value of `nums` or `ans`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the code snippet, the values of `nums` and `ans` remain unchanged.
