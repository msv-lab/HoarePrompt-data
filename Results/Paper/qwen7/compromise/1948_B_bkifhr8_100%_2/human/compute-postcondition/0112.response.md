Output State: **ans is False, i is 0, m is at least 3, and arr[i-1] is nums[0].**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be reduced by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0. Since the loop breaks when `ans` becomes `False`, and given that `ans` is set to `False` as soon as the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met, `ans` will remain `False` throughout the loop's execution. The value of `i` will eventually reach 0, meaning the loop has processed all elements in the list `arr` from `m-2` down to 0. The value of `arr[i - 1]` will be the last updated value of `nums[0]` before the loop exited, which is the smallest digit of `arr[i]` if the condition was met, or simply the original value of `arr[i - 1]` if the condition was never met.
