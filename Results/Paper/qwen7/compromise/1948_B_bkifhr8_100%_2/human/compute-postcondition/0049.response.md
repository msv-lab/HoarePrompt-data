Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 1, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[0]`, and the current value of `nums` is not sorted and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the context in which it was placed. All other variables retain their initial states.
