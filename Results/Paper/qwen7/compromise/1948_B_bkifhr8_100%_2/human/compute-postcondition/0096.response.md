Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 2`, `m` must be at least 3, `arr[i]` is the last element of `nums`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement in the given code, the `break` statement simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables `ans`, `i`, `m`, and `arr[i]` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `m` must be at least 3 and `arr[i]` is the last element of `nums` remains valid.
