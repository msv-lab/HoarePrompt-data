Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem within the given constraints:

1. **Incorrect Query Strategy**: The code attempts to find the maximum XOR by comparing OR values directly, but it doesn't effectively utilize the information from the comparisons to deduce the maximum XOR. The logic for finding `maxi` and `mini` is flawed and does not guarantee that the final pair `(maxi, mini)` will have the maximum XOR.

2. **Query Limitation**: The solution makes up to \(2n\) queries per test case, which is close to the limit of \(3n\) but still exceeds the optimal strategy. An optimal solution should aim to find the maximum XOR with significantly fewer queries.

3. **Lack of XOR Maximization Logic**: The code does not implement a strategy to maximize the XOR value based on the results of the OR comparisons. Instead, it focuses on finding the indices with the highest OR values, which is not sufficient to ensure the maximum XOR.

### Suggested Approach:
A more effective approach involves leveraging the properties of XOR and OR operations. Here's a high-level outline of a better strategy:

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Use a divide-and-conquer approach to narrow down the potential candidates for the maximum XOR.
2. **Binary Search**: Implement a binary search to efficiently find the pair with the maximum XOR.
3. **Query Optimization**: Ensure each query provides useful information to reduce the search space.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of how you might implement such a solution:

```python
def find_max_xor(n):
    # Initialize the answer
    max_xor = 0
    i, j = 0, 0
    
    # Divide and Conquer approach
    def query(a, b, c, d):
        print(f'? {a} {b} {c} {d}', flush=True)
        res = input().strip()
        return res
    
    # Binary search to find the maximum XOR
    def binary_search(low, high):
        nonlocal max_xor, i, j
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            # Compare mid with (n-1)
            res = query(mid, mid, n-1, n-1)
            if res == '=':
                max_xor = mid ^ (n-1)
                i, j = mid, n-1
                break
            elif res == '<':
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
    
    # Initial binary search
    binary_search(0, n-1)
    
    # Verify and output the result
    print(f'! {i} {j}', flush=True)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        find_max_xor(n)

func()
```

This approach uses a binary search to efficiently find the pair with the maximum XOR, making sure to stay within the query limit.
