Output State: `res` is the final input string provided by the user after the loop has executed all its iterations, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, and `i` is equal to `n`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration, it prints the current value of `maxi` and increments `i`. If `res` is `<`, `maxi` is updated to the current value of `i`. After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `maxi` will hold the last value of `i` that was printed, which is `n-1`. The variable `res` retains the value it had after the last iteration or input, as no further updates to `res` are mentioned in the loop body.
