Output State: **i is equal to n, res is an input string, and arr contains the values from 1 to n-1.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will increment from `n` to `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. During each iteration, the value of `i` is printed and then checked against the input `res`. If `res` is `<`, `arr` is updated to contain just the current value of `i`. If `res` is `=`, the current value of `i` is appended to `arr`. Since the loop runs `n-1` times, `arr` will contain all values from `1` to `n-1` in the order they were appended, which corresponds to the values of `i` during each iteration. The variable `maxi` is not mentioned in the loop body and remains unchanged from its initial value of `0`. The variable `n` and `res` (the input string) remain as they were initially.
