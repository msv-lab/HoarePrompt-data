Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is equal to `arr[0]`, `res` is a new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, and `i` is either `n` or `n+1`. `arr` is either `[i]`, `[n, n+1]`, or `[n, n, n+1]` depending on the value of `res` for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is equal to `item`, `res` is the input string with the value '>', `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is either `n` or `n+1`, `arr` must be one of `[n, n+1]` or `[n, n, n+1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `mini` is equal to `item`, `res` is the input string, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is either `n` or `n+1`, `arr` must be one of `[n, n+1]` or `[n, n, n+1]`. If `res` equals `'><'`, the function does nothing to `mini`, `maxi`, `i`, and `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is equal to the next item in `arr[1:]`, `res` is an input string, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is either `n` or `n+1`, `arr` is the remaining elements of `arr[1:]`, and if `res` equals '>', `mini` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
