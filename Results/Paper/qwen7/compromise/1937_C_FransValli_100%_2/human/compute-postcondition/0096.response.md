Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is mentioned to be greater than 2 but its exact value is not needed for the print statement.
- `res` is the input string, but its specific value is not provided.
- If `res` is equal to '<', then `maxi` is 2. Since the value of `res` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `maxi`.

Given this information, the print statement will output a formatted string with placeholders for the values of `maxi` and `i`. Since `i` is explicitly given as 3, and `maxi` could either be 2 (if `res` is '<') or undefined (if `res` is not '<'), we will consider both cases.

However, since the exact value of `maxi` is not provided, we will describe it based on the condition.

Output: **'? 2 2 3 3' (if res is '<') or '? undefined undefined 3 3' (if res is not '<')**
