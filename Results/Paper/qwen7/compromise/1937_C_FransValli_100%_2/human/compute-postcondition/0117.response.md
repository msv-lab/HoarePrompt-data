Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `res` is an input string, `arr` contains the value of `i + 1` if `res` is '<' or '='; otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is assigned the value of the input string. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states unless `res` is specifically '<' or '=', in which case `arr` would contain the value of `i + 1`. Since the actual input string is not provided, we cannot determine the exact state of `arr`, but we know it will only change if `res` meets the specified condition.
