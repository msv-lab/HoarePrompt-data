Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - If `res` equals '<', then `maxi` is also 2 (though this condition does not affect the loop itself)

3. **Determine the Next Values for `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` as 1 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`. Since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
