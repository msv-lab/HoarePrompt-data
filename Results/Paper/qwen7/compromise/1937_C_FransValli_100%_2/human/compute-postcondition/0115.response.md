Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If `res` is equal to '<', `arr` contains the value of `i`.
   - If `res` is not equal to '<' but equals '=', `arr` also contains the value of `i`.
   - Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Check the postconditions for the next iteration**:
   - The postcondition for the loop is that `i` must still be less than `n`.
   - `res` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `arr` will depend on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is '<', `arr` will contain the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`).
     - If `res` is '=', `arr` will also contain the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`).
     - Otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `res` remains the same.
   - `arr` will contain the new value of `i` if `res` is '<' or '='.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `res` is the same, `arr` contains the value of `i + 1` if `res` is '<' or '='; otherwise, `arr` remains unchanged**.
