Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `mini` is equal to the next item in `arr[1:]`. This means `mini` is the first element of the list `arr[1:]`, which is `arr[1]`.
   - `res` is the input string (though it is not used in the print statement).
   - `maxi` is equal to `n-1`. Here, `n` is the length of the original list `arr`. So, `maxi` is the length of `arr[1:]`, which is `n-1`.
   - `i` is either `n` or `n+1`. Since `i` is not used in the print statement, we don't need to determine which one it is.
   - `arr` is the remaining elements of `arr[1:]`, which is the same as `arr[1:]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```
   - The string `'?'` is printed first.
   - `mini` is printed twice. As determined earlier, `mini` is `arr[1]`.
   - `item` is printed twice. However, `item` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. Since `item` is not defined, it will be printed as `item`.

Based on this analysis, the print statement will output a string with the following components:
- A question mark (`?`)
- The value of `mini`, which is `arr[1]`
- The value of `mini` again, which is `arr[1]`
- The value of `item`, which is undefined and will be printed as `item`
- The value of `item` again, which is undefined and will be printed as `item`

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? arr[1] arr[1] item item'**
