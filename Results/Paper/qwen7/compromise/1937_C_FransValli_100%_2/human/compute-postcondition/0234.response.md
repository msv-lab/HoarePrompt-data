Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `mini` is equal to the last item in `arr[1:]`. Since `arr` is empty, `arr[1:]` is also an empty list, and there is no last item. In Python, accessing the last item of an empty list would raise an `IndexError`. However, since the precondition explicitly states that `mini` is equal to the last item in `arr[1:]`, we need to consider the context where this might be handled. Typically, such cases might return `None` or handle it gracefully. For simplicity, let's assume it returns `None`.
   - `res` is an input string, but its value is not specified.
   - `maxi` is equal to `n-1`. The value of `n` is not specified, so we cannot determine `maxi` precisely. Let's denote `n` as an unknown value.
   - `i` is either `n` or `n+1`. Again, the value of `n` is not specified, so `i` could be `n` or `n+1`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)`.
   - `'!'` is a literal string.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - `mini` is `None` (as explained above).

Given these details, the print statement will output the string `'!'` followed by the value of `maxi` and `mini`.

Output: **! None n-1**
