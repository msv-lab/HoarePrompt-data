Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `res` is an input string, `arr` is a list containing `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `arr = [i]` creates a list `arr` with the value of `i`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `res` is an input string, and `arr` is a list containing `i + 1`.
