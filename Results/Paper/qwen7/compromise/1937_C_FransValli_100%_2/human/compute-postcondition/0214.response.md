Output State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[0]`, `res` is a new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, and `i` is either `n` or `n+1`. `arr` is either `[i]`, `[n, n+1]`, or `[n, n, n+1]` depending on the value of `res` for each iteration.**

Explanation: The line `mini = arr[0]` assigns the first element of the list `arr` to the variable `mini`. The values of `res`, `maxi`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `arr` also remains in one of its possible states `[i]`, `[n, n+1]`, or `[n, n, n+1]` based on the value of `res`.
