Output State: **`arr` is either `[i+1, i]` or `[0, i+1, i+1, i]`, `n` is at least `i + 2`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Depending on the initial state of `arr`, the updated state will be:
- If `arr` was initially `[i+1]`, it becomes `[i+1, i]`.
- If `arr` was initially `[0, i+1, i+1]`, it becomes `[0, i+1, i+1, i]`.

The values of `n`, `maxi`, and `res` remain unchanged.
