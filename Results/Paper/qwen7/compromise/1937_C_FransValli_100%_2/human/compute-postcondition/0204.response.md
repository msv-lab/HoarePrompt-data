Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is a new input string from the user.
   - `maxi` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `arr` is a list containing `[i]`.
     - If `res` is `<`, then `arr` is `[i]`.
     - Otherwise, `arr` is `[i, i]`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `n` (since the loop runs up to `n-1`).
   - `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `res` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `maxi` remains `n-1` because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n`.
   - `arr` will be updated based on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is `<`, then `arr` will be `[n]`.
     - Otherwise, `arr` will be `[n, n]`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is a new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, and `arr` is either `[n]` or `[n, n]` depending on the value of `res`.**
