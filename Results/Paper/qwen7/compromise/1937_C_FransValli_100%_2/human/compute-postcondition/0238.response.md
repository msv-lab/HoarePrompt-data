Functionality: **The function interacts with an external permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1. It makes up to 3n queries comparing bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements in the permutation. After identifying the indices i and j that maximize the bitwise XOR operation \( p_i \oplus p_j \), it prints the result as "! i j".**
