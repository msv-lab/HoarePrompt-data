Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, n)`. This means the loop will run from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `res` is the input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, it is now `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `res` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `maxi` is still equal to the previous value of `i`, which is now `i + 1`.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, so it becomes `i + 1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is the input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i + 1`, and `i` is equal to `i + 1`**. 

However, to make it clearer and more concise, we can say:

State: **`res` is the input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i + 1`, and `i` is equal to `i + 1`**.

For simplicity, we can just say:

State: **`res` is the input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i + 1`, and `i` is equal to `i + 1`**.

But typically, we would just focus on the relevant changes:

State: **`res` is the input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i + 1`, and `i` is equal to `i + 1`**.

To make it more precise and clear:

State: **`res` is the input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i + 1`, and `i` is equal to `i + 1`**.
