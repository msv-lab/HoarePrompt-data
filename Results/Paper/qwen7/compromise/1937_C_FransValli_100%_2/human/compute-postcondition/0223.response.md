Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `mini` is equal to `n+1`.
   - `res` is the input string with the value '>'.
   - `maxi` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `i` is either `n` or `n+1`.
   - `arr` must be one of `[n, n+1]` or `[n, n, n+1]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mini` is explicitly defined as `n+1`.
- `item` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be one of the elements in `arr`.

Given that `arr` can be either `[n, n+1]` or `[n, n, n+1]`, and `i` is either `n` or `n+1`, `item` can only be `n` or `n+1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a literal string).
- `mini`, which is `n+1`.
- `mini` again, which is `n+1`.
- `item`, which can be either `n` or `n+1`.
- `item` again, which will be the same as the first `item`.

So, the possible outputs are:
- If `item` is `n`: `'?', n+1, n+1, n, n`
- If `item` is `n+1`: `'?', n+1, n+1, n+1, n+1`

Since we need to provide the most precise description possible based on the precondition, we'll use the general form where `item` can be either `n` or `n+1`.

Output: **'? [n+1] [n+1] [item] [item]' (where [item] is either [n] or [n+1])**
