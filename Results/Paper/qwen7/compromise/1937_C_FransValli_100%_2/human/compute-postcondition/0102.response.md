Output State: **`arr` is [0], `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `res` is the last input string received, `maxi` is the maximum value between 0 and any value assigned to it during the loop (which happens when `res` equals '<').**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `arr` as a list containing a single element `0`. The loop condition and the values of `n`, `i`, `res`, and `maxi` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on these variables within the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions provided.
