Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`. Therefore, only these two variables can be adjusted.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (since `range(1, n)` means `i` takes values from `1` to `n-1`). 

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is the input string provided by the user.
   - If `res` is equal to `<`, then `maxi` is equal to `i`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was one less than what it will be in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Given that `i` was one less than its current value at the end of the previous iteration, if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then `i` will be `k+1` in the next iteration. Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we can denote it as `i` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is the input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i` if `res` is equal to `<`, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

To simplify, we can say:

State: **`res` is the input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i` if `res` is equal to `<`, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

However, since we need to provide a clear state update without referencing the previous value of `i`, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`res` is the input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i` if `res` is equal to `<`, and `i` is the next value in the range**.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`res` is the input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i` if `res` is equal to `<`, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
