Output State: mini is equal to n-1, arr is an empty list, maxi is equal to n-1, and the loop has executed for all iterations of n.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `maxi` will be set to `n-1` because it is updated to the largest index during each iteration. The variable `mini` will also end up being `n-1` as it is updated to the smallest index within the array `arr` in each iteration. By the end of the loop, `arr` will be an empty list because all possible indices have been checked and added to `arr`, then replaced with a new minimum value in subsequent iterations. The loop has processed all iterations of `n`, meaning it has gone through all indices from 1 to `n-1`.
