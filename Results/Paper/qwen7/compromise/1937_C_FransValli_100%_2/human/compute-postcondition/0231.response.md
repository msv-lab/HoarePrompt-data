Output State: **`mini` is equal to `item`, `res` is an input string, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is either `n` or `n+1`, `arr` is the remaining elements of `arr[1:]`.**

Explanation: The code `mini = item` assigns the value of `item` to the variable `mini`. All other variables (`res`, `maxi`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
