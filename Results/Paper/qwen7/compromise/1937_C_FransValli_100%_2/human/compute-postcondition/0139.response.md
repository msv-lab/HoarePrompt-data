Output State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[1]`, `item` is `arr[1]`, `res` is '>'**

Explanation: The code `mini = item` simply assigns the value of `item` to `mini`. Since both `mini` and `item` are initially equal to `arr[1]`, the assignment does not change their values. The value of `res` remains unchanged as well.
