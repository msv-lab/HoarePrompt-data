Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain in their initial state, which in this case is not specified beyond being integers. Since the initial state only specifies that the integer value must be obtained from `int(input())` and must be a positive integer, we know that `n` is now a positive integer.
