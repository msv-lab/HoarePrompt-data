Output State: **`res` is the new input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i + 1`, and `i` is equal to `i + 1`, and `maxi` is now equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code `maxi = i` updates the value of `maxi` to be the same as the current value of `i`. Since `i` was previously equal to `i + 1`, the updated value of `i` is `i + 1`. Therefore, `maxi` is now also equal to `i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
