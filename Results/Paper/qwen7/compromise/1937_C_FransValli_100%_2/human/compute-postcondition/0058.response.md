Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` is defined as `[i+2, i+1]`
- `item` is defined as `i+1`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement:

```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The string `'?'` is a literal string that will be printed as is.
2. `mini` is not defined in the initial state, so it must be a typo or a placeholder. Given the context, it seems like it should be `item` since `item` is the only other variable mentioned.
3. The value of `item` is `i+1`.
4. Therefore, the print statement will print the string `'?'`, followed by the value of `item` twice.

Given this, the output will be:

Output: **'? i+1 i+1'**
