Output State: mini is equal to n-1, arr is an empty list, maxi is equal to n-1, and the loop has executed for all iterations of n.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `maxi` will be set to `n-1` because it is updated to the maximum index found during the comparisons. The variable `arr` will be an empty list because it gets reset to `[0]` at the start of each iteration and never gets appended to again after the second iteration. The variable `mini` will also be `n-1` as it is updated to the minimum index found among the candidates in the final comparison phase. The loop has now executed for all iterations of `n`.
