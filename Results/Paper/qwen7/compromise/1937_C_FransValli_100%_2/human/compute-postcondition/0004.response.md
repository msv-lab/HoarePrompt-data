Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Here, `maxi` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value precisely. However, since it is not defined elsewhere in the context provided, we can assume it might be a placeholder or a variable that hasn't been initialized with a specific value. Given no further information, we'll treat `maxi` as an undefined variable.

The print statement will output a string with the following components:
- `'?'` (a question mark)
- `maxi` (repeated twice)
- `i` (which is 1, repeated twice)

Since `maxi` is not defined, we will represent it as `maxi` in the output.

Output: **'? maxi maxi 1 1'**
