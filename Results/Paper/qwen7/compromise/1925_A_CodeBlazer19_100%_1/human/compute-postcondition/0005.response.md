Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet ('a' to 'z') repeated `n` times. The process is repeated `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases specified at the beginning. The final state of the program is that it has printed the required strings for all test cases.**
