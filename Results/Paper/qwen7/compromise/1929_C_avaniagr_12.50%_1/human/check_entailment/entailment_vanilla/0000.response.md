### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha needs to ensure he can win any number of coins by placing bets.
   - The casino rules dictate how much Sasha wins or loses based on his bet.
   - There is a promotion limit where Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - The code checks different conditions based on the values of `x` and `k`:
     - If `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 1`.
     - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 3`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates a value `z` using a loop and checks if `a >= z`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1 (`x < k - 1`):**
     - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always win after losing at most `x` times because he can always place a bet of `x + 1` coins.
     - This condition ensures that Sasha can recover from losing up to `x` times and still have enough coins to win.
   - **Condition 2 (`x == k - 1`):**
     - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can win after losing `x` times by ensuring he has at least `x + 3` coins initially.
     - This condition ensures that Sasha can recover from losing exactly `x` times and still have enough coins to win.
   - **General Case (`x > k - 1`):**
     - The code calculates `z` as the sum of the series where each term is the previous term divided by `(k - 1)` plus one.
     - This calculation ensures that Sasha can recover from losing `x` times and still have enough coins to win.
     - The condition `a >= z` checks if Sasha has enough initial coins to cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times and then winning.

4. **Verification:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the logic of the code.
   - The code correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that Sasha can achieve the goal based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal of having any number of coins.

**Correctness: True**
