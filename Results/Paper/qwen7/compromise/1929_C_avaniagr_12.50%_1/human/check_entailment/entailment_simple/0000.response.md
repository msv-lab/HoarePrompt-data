### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If `x < k - 1`, the program checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
   - **Case 2**: If `x == k - 1`, the program checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
   - **Case 3**: If `x > k - 1`, the program calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can eventually have any number of coins. This calculation involves a loop where `z` is updated iteratively based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Strategy Analysis**:
   - For **Case 1 (`x < k - 1`)**: The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha can place a bet of `1` coin and still have enough coins to recover from one loss. Since Sasha can place a bet of `1` after a loss, he can ensure he doesn't lose more than `x` times in a row because `x < k - 1`.
   - For **Case 2 (`x == k - 1`)**: The condition `a >= x + 3` ensures that Sasha can place a bet of `1` after a loss and still have enough coins to recover from two consecutive losses. Since Sasha can place a bet of `1` after a loss, he can ensure he doesn't lose more than `x` times in a row because `x == k - 1`.
   - For **Case 3 (`x > k - 1`)**: The calculation of `z` ensures that Sasha can place bets in such a way that he can recover from `x` consecutive losses. The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` accounts for the exponential growth in the number of coins needed to recover from losses, ensuring that Sasha can eventually have any number of coins.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program logic matches the problem description and the conditions provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
