Output State: **`k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `z` is 0, `i` is 3, and `t` is `t - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `z` is reassigned to 0, overriding its previous value which was dependent on the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
