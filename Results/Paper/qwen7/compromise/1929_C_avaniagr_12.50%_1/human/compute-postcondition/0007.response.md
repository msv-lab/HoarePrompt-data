Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30.
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < k - 1.
- `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is updated to the first integer from input.
- `x` is updated to the second integer from input.
- `a` is updated to the third integer from input.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Since no values for `k`, `x`, or `a` are specified in the initial state, and the values are updated from input, the actual values of these variables do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
