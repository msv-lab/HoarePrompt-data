Output State: The value of `z` will be the result of repeatedly applying the operation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` times, starting from the initial value of `z` which is 0. Given the constraints, `x` can be any integer between 1 and 100, and the loop will run `x + 1` times. After all iterations, `z` will be the final accumulated value based on the given operation.

To summarize, `z` will be the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added to itself `x + 1` times, starting from `z = 0`.
