Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `x + 1`
- `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 5
- `z` is the result of repeatedly applying the operation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to `x + 1`
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` without referencing any of the variables `i`, `x`, `z`, or `a`, the output will be exactly as written in the print statement.

Output: **YES**
