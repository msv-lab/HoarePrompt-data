Postcondition: `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `t` is greater than 0 and is now `t - 1`. If `x < k - 1`, then `t` remains unchanged. If `x == k - 1`, then `x` remains unchanged, `z` is either 5 or 6 depending on whether `a` is less than 5 or greater than or equal to 5, and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `x` is set to 2, `z` is either 5 or 6 depending on whether `a` is less than 5 or greater than or equal to 5, and `i` is 3.
