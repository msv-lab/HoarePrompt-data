Postcondition: **Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `z` will be the result of repeatedly adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself for `x + 1` times, where `x` is the number of iterations specified initially. `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial or first iteration values, and `t` remains greater than 0.**
