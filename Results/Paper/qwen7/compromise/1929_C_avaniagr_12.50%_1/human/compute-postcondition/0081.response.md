Output State: **`i` is 5, `x` must be at least 5, `z` is `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. However, since the initial value of `z` and the value of `k` are not provided, `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
