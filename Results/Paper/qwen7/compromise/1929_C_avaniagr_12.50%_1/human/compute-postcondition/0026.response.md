Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value of `x`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` must be between 1 and 100.
   - `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `x`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x` in the next iteration. Therefore, `i` should be set to `x + 1`.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged because the loop itself does not modify `x`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `x` remains between 1 and 100.
   - `z` is updated but its new value is not specified in the loop head.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`x` must be between 1 and 100; `i` is 0 (since it starts from 0 in the range function)**
