Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, where each line corresponds to the output of one test case. For each test case, if `a >= b`, it will print `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints `ans + p2` based on the given formulae, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the sum of an arithmetic series, and `p2` is the sum of `a` repeated for `n - k` times.
