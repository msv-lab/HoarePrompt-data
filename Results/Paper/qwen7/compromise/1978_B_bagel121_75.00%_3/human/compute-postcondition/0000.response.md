Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is read during the execution of this line, the exact value of `t` is not specified here, but it is known to be a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this line of code, so their initial state remains unchanged.
