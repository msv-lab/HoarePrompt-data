Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers t, n, m, k, and a list a of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a cost based on specific conditions involving n, m, and k, and prints the calculated cost. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the cost for each test case.**
