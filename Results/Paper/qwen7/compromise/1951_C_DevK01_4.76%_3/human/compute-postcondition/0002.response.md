Output State: **After executing the loop for `t` iterations, the variable `cost` will hold the calculated cost for each iteration based on the given logic. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` will remain unchanged from their initial states, and `t` will be the number of iterations executed.**

This means that for each iteration of the loop, the cost is calculated based on the input values provided, and then printed. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values, and `t` reflects the total number of iterations completed.
