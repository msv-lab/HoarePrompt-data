Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Ticket Purchases**: The logic for purchasing tickets and updating prices is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the process where buying `x` tickets on day `i` increases the price of tickets on subsequent days by `x`.

2. **Sorting the Prices**: Sorting the prices array before processing can lead to incorrect results because the order of prices matters when calculating the minimum cost.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost**: The cost calculation does not accurately reflect the scenario where buying tickets on different days affects the prices of subsequent days.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the process of buying tickets and updating prices dynamically. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))

        def calculate_cost(prices, m, k):
            cost = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if k <= 0:
                    break
                x = min(m, k)
                cost += x * prices[i]
                k -= x
                prices[i] += x
                prices[i+1:] = [p + x for p in prices[i+1:]]
            return cost

        print(calculate_cost(prices, m, k))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Function `calculate_cost`**: This function takes the list of prices, the maximum tickets that can be bought per day (`m`), and the number of tickets to be bought (`k`). It iterates through each day, buying the maximum possible tickets (`min(m, k)`), updating the prices accordingly, and subtracting the bought tickets from `k`.

2. **Dynamic Update of Prices**: After buying tickets on a particular day, the prices for subsequent days are updated by adding the number of tickets bought on the current day.

3. **Termination Condition**: The loop breaks if the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) becomes zero.

This approach ensures that the simulation accurately reflects the problem constraints and calculates the minimum cost correctly.
