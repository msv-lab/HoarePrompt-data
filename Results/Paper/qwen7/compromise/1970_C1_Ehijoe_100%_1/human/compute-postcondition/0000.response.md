Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the next t integers correspond to the starting node for each round where the stone is initially placed. Additionally, the tree has exactly two leaves; `n` and `t` are updated to the values entered by the user.**

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `t`. Since the initial values of `u` and `v` are not affected by the input, they remain as described in the initial state. The value of `t` is explicitly set to 1, and the next `t` integers (which is 1 integer) will correspond to the starting node for each round where the stone is initially placed. The tree's property of having exactly two leaves remains unchanged.
