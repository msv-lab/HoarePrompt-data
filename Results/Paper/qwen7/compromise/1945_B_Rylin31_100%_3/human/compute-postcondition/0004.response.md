Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers a, b, and m, where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (t being the number of test cases). It returns different values based on the relationship between a, b, and m for each test case.**

Given the constraints and relationships, the function likely processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers a, b, and m. For each set of these integers, the function performs some operation or comparison and returns a result specific to that test case. However, since the exact operation is not specified, the focus here is on the parameters and the nature of the function's processing.
