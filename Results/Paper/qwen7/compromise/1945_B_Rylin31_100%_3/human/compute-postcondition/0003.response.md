Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` for the corresponding input values of `a`, `b`, and `m` provided in the `t` iterations of the loop. Each input set `(a, b, m)` is processed independently, and the results are printed in sequence.
