Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `j = 0` simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `j`. Since `i` and `l` are not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. The value of `n` also remains unchanged as it was not involved in this assignment.
