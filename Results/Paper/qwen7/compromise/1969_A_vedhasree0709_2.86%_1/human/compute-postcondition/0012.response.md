Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`. Otherwise, the conditions remain as per the precondition.
