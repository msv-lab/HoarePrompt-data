Postcondition: ***`i` is incremented until it reaches a value of at least 1, `j` remains 1, and `l` remains a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers. If `j` is 0, the final value of `i` is determined by the loop execution, which increments `i` until it meets the loop termination condition.***
