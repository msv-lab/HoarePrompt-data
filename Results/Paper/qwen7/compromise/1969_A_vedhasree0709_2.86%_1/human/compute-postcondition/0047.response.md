Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so after executing this line, `i` becomes 1. The values of `j` and `l` remain unchanged because they were not affected by the code.
