Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, the current value of `l[i]` is 2, the current value of `l[i + 1]` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `j = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `j`. The values of `i`, `l`, `l[i]`, and `l[i + 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
