The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `i <= n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:

1. The variable `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.
2. The variable `n` must be such that `i` can still satisfy the condition `i <= n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the states are as follows:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `j` is 1.
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2 (since `i` starts at 1), and `n` must be at least 2 to satisfy the condition `i <= n - 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
