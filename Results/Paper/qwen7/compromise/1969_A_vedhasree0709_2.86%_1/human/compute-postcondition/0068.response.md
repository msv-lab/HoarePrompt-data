Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers, `n` is an input integer which is 1 or more.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and `n` is mentioned as an input integer which is 1 or more, but its specific value is not provided, so it remains as a condition rather than a specific value.
