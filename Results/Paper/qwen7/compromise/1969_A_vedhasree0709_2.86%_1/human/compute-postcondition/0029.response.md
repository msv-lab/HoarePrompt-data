Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the conditions inside the loop were met for any iteration, and `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. The variable `j` will retain its last value, which is either 0 (if the conditions inside the loop were never met) or 1 (if the conditions inside the loop were met at any point). The list `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
