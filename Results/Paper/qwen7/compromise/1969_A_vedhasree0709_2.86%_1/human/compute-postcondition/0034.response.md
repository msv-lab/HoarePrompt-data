Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are the number of iterations, which is determined by `int(input())`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute again**: The loop will execute again if `int(input())` is greater than the current value of `i`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `j` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `l` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **New state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `int(input())` must be greater than the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`). Therefore, `int(input())` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`i` is equal to `n + 1`, `j` is 0, and `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**
