Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Determine the current state of variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= n - 1` must be true.
   - Given that `i` is 0, the condition simplifies to `0 <= n - 1`, which means `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0.
4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
