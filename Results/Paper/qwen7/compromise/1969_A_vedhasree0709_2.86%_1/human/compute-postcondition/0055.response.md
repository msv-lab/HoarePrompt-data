Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.

2. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 1 (though `j` is not part of the loop condition).
   - The loop breaks if `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`.

4. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3 (since `i <= n - 1` implies `n - 1 > 2`).

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` can still satisfy the loop condition `i <= n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue.

### Conclusion:
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that `i` can still satisfy the loop condition.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 3**
