The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i <= n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

Since `i` is currently 1, the only way for the loop to execute again is if `n` is greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `n` must be greater than 2**
