The code snippet provided contains a single `print(3)` statement. According to the initial state, the variables `i` and `j` have specific values, but these do not affect the execution of the `print` statement. The `l` variable is a list of integers obtained from an input string, but since no input string is provided, it does not influence the output of the `print` statement either.

The `print(3)` statement will simply print the integer 3.

Output: **3**
