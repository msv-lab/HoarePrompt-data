Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function prints a query `? d` and waits for the response.
   - It returns a tuple `(v, u)` where `v` is the vertex with the minimum degree at least `d` and `u` is the vertex that is not connected to `v`.
   - If `v` is `0`, it means no such vertex exists, and it returns `(0, 0)`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices in the Hamiltonian path and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from `1` to `n`.
   - It iterates while `remaining_vertices` is not empty.
   - For each degree `d` from `n-1` down to `0`, it calls `func_1(d)` to get the vertex `v` and the non-connected vertex `u`.
     - If `v` is `0`, it skips to the next iteration.
     - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
   - Once a vertex `v` is added to the path, it breaks out of the loop and continues until all vertices are added to the path.
   - Finally, it prints the path in the required format and flushes the output buffer.

### Correctness Check

1. **Query Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the queries by printing `? d` and reading the responses.
   - The responses are processed correctly, and the program behaves as expected when `v` is `0`.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program attempts to construct a Hamiltonian path by selecting vertices with the minimum degree and ensuring they are not connected to the previously selected vertices.
   - The logic seems sound in terms of ensuring that each vertex is visited exactly once and that the path is constructed correctly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no vertex with a degree at least `d` exists by skipping to the next iteration.
   - It ensures that the path is constructed within the allowed number of queries (`n`).

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program appears to follow the correct approach to find a Hamiltonian path using the given constraints and interactions. The logic is sound, and the implementation seems to handle all necessary cases correctly.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
