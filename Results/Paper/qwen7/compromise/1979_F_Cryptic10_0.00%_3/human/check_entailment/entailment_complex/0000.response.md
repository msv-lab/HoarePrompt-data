### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph with \( n \) vertices where exactly \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete graph. The interaction involves querying the degree of vertices and identifying vertices that are not connected to a given vertex.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(d)`**: This function queries the graph for the vertex with the minimum degree at least `d` and a vertex not connected to it. It correctly handles the case where no such vertex is found by returning 0 for both values.
   - **Function `func_2(n)`**: This function aims to construct a Hamiltonian path. It iteratively uses `func_1(d)` to find and remove vertices from the graph. The key steps are:
     - Initialize `path` to store the Hamiltonian path and `remaining_vertices` to keep track of unvisited vertices.
     - For each possible degree `d` from \( n - 1 \) down to 0, it calls `func_1(d)` to get a vertex `v` and a non-connected vertex `u`.
     - If `v` is found and is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
     - Once all vertices are visited, it prints the path in reverse order (from \( n \) to 1).

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **Query Handling**: The function `func_1(d)` correctly formats the query and processes the response, ensuring the interaction protocol is followed.
   - **Path Construction**: The function `func_2(n)` correctly constructs the path by iteratively selecting vertices based on their degrees and ensuring all vertices are included exactly once. The path is built in a manner that ensures a Hamiltonian path is formed.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles the case where no vertex with the required degree is found by continuing to the next lower degree.

Given the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the logic to find a Hamiltonian path using the specified queries and interactions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
