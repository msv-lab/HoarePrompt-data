Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - It defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` correctly prints the query and reads the response, returning the values `v` and `u`.

2. **Graph Traversal Logic in `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` initializes a list `path` to store the Hamiltonian path and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices.
   - It uses a loop to find the vertex with the minimum degree at least `d` for decreasing values of `d` from `n-1` to `0`.
   - For each `d`, it calls `func_1(d)` to get the vertex `v` and its non-connected neighbor `u`.
   - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it is added to the path and removed from `remaining_vertices`.
   - This process continues until all vertices are added to the path.

3. **Output**:
   - The path is constructed in reverse order due to the decrementing loop in `func_2`.
   - The path is then reversed before being printed, ensuring the correct order of vertices in the Hamiltonian path.

4. **Query Limit**:
   - The program ensures that no more than `n` queries are made for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is sound and adheres to the problem constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
