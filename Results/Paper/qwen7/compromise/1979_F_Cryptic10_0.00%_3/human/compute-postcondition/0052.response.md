Output State: **`v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, and we continue in the loop or iteration.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `v` and `u`, they retain their original values, which are the return values of `func_1(d)`. The `continue` statement itself does not alter these values but indicates that the control flow continues with the next iteration of the loop.
