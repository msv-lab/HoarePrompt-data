Output State: **`d` is -1, `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations, `remaining_vertices` is empty.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `d = n-1` down to `d = 0`. After each iteration, `d` decreases by 1. Since the loop continues until `d` reaches -1, it will execute `n` times in total. During each iteration, if `v` (the return value of `func_1(d)`) is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is appended to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is 0 or not in `remaining_vertices`, no changes are made. By the end of all iterations, `d` will be -1, `path` will contain all vertices that were processed and added according to the conditions, and `remaining_vertices` will be empty since all eligible vertices have been removed.
