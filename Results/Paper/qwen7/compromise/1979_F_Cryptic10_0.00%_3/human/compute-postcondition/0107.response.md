Output State: **`path` contains all vertices from 1 to n in descending order, `remaining_vertices` is an empty set, and `d` is -1.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. Since no variables are modified by this line of code, the values of `path`, `remaining_vertices`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial state.
