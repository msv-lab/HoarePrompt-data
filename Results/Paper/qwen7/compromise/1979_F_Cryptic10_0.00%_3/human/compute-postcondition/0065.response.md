Output State: **`d` is `d - 2`, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d - 1)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d - 1)`, `path` contains the value of `v` if `v` does not equal 0, `remaining_vertices` has removed the vertex `v` from its list.**

Explanation: The code `remaining_vertices.remove(v)` removes the vertex `v` from the list `remaining_vertices`. The values of `d`, `v`, `u`, and `path` remain unchanged from their initial states.
