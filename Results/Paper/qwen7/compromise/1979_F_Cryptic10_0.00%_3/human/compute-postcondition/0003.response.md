Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `d`, which is initialized using `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means `d` will take values from `n-1` down to `0`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `d`**: The loop will start with `d` equal to `n-1`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `d` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `d` must be non-negative for the loop to execute.

4. **Identify the state adjustments needed**: We need to ensure that `d` is initialized correctly and that the loop can execute based on the given range. Since `d` starts at `n-1`, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.

5. **Consider the initial state of `path` and `remaining_vertices`**: The problem states that `path` is an empty list and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty. These states do not affect the loop's execution directly but are part of the overall program state.

Based on the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `d` should be initialized to `n-1`.
- `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty, `d` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0**.
