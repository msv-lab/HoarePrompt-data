Output State: **`path` contains `v`, `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, and if `v` equals 0, we continue in the loop or iteration. If `v` does not equal 0, no change is made to the variables.**

Explanation: The code appends `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, it remains unchanged. The condition that if `v` equals 0, we continue in the loop or iteration, is still valid. If `v` does not equal 0, no change is made to the variables.
