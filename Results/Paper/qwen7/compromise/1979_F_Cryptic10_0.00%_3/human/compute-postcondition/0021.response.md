Output State: **`path` is a list where it now includes the vertex `v` at the beginning, `remaining_vertices` does not contain the vertex `v`, and `d` is `v - 2`, and the value of `remaining_vertices` is updated by removing `v`.**

In this output state, the `remaining_vertices` list no longer contains the vertex `v`, while `path` remains a list that starts with the vertex `v`, and `d` remains equal to `v - 2`.
