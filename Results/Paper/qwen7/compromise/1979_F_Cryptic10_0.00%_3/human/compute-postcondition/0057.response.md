Output State: **`path` contains `v`, `remaining_vertices` has had the vertex `v` removed from it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `path` was being updated and `remaining_vertices` was being modified. The values of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the program exits the current loop or conditional block.
