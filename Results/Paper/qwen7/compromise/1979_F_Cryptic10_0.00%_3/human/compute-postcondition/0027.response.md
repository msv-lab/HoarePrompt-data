Output State: **`v` is equal to `d - 3`, `u` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path` remains unchanged, `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. Therefore, the values of `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.
