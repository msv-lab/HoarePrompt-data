Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
while remaining_vertices:
    for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        v, u = func_1(d)
        if v == 0:
            continue
        if v in remaining_vertices:
            path.append(v)
            remaining_vertices.remove(v)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The final state of the loop will be such that `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations, with each vertex being added from the highest index `d` down to 0. The `remaining_vertices` list will be empty since every vertex that was present initially has been removed from it and added to `path`. The value of `d` will be -1 after the loop completes, as the loop iterates over `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` and decrements `d` in each iteration until it reaches -1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `d` is -1, `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations, `remaining_vertices` is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: d is 0, v and u are the return values of func_1(0), path contains all vertices added during the iterations plus the vertex v (if applicable), and remaining_vertices does not contain the vertex v (if applicable).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
