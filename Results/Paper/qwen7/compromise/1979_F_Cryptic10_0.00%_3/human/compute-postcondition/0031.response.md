Output State: **`v` is equal to `d - 3`, `u` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path` now includes `v` as its last element but `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices`, and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code removes `v` from the `remaining_vertices` list. Since `v` is equal to `d - 3`, this relationship remains true. The other variables (`u` and `path`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
