Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `d` is initialized from `n-1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.
   - The loop variable `d` is used in the loop.
   - There are no other variables directly involved in the loop head.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `d`:**
   - The initial value of `d` is given as `-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs in reverse order from `n-1` to `-1`.
   - For the loop to start, `d` must be able to iterate from `n-1` down to `0`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `d` starts at `-1`, the loop will not execute because `d` is already less than `n-1`.
   - To make the loop execute, `d` must start from `n-1` or higher.

5. **Consider Other Given States:**
   - `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations.
   - `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `d` starts from a value that allows the loop to execute. Specifically, `d` should start from `n-1` or higher.

**Final State Adjustment:**

State: **`d` is `n-1`, `path` contains all vertices added during the iterations, `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one vertex**
