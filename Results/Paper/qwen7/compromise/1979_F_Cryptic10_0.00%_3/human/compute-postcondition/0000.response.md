Output State: **`path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices that have not been removed yet.**

The code initializes an empty list named `path`. This does not affect the value of `remaining_vertices` or the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions where `remaining_vertices` contains integers from 1 to n, and `path` is an empty list.
