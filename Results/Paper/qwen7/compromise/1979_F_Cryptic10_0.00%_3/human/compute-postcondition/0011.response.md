Output State: **`path` is now ['v'], `remaining_vertices` contains the vertex `v`, `d` is `n-1`**.

Explanation: The code `path.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Initially, `path` is an empty list, so after appending `v`, `path` becomes `['v']`. The other variables (`remaining_vertices` and `d`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
