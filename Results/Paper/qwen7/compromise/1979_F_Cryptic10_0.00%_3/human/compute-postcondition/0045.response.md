Output State: **`v` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `u` is the second return value of `func_1(d)`, `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, and `path` now includes the value of `v`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` to the list `path`. Since `v` was already the return value of `func_1(d)` and is in `remaining_vertices`, appending it to `path` updates the list `path` to include this value. The other variables remain unchanged.
