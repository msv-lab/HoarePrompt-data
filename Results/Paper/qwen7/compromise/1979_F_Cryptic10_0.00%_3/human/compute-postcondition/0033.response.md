Postcondition: `v` is equal to `d - 3`, `u` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path` now includes `v` as its last element but `v` has been removed from `remaining_vertices`, and `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. This is true if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`; otherwise, the values of `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain as they were initially.
