The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a graph. It constructs a path by iteratively selecting vertices based on their degrees and removing them from the set of remaining vertices. The path is constructed in such a way that it includes all vertices from 1 to n, added in descending order from the highest index `d` down to 0. After processing, the function prints the path as a sequence of vertices, starting from n and ending at 1. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the path directly.
