n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The variable `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices that have not been removed yet. The function `func_1(d)` is expected to return a tuple `(v, u)` where `v` is the vertex with the minimum degree at least `d` (or 0 if no such vertex exists), and `u` is the vertex that is not connected to `v` (or 0 if no such vertex exists).
