Reasoning:
1. The problem requires decoding an encoded string back to its original form.
2. The given program attempts to decode the string by reversing the process used for encoding.
3. In the encoding process, a string `r` is created containing all unique characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order. Each character in `s` is then replaced by its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.
4. The function `func_1` is supposed to reverse this process, but it has a few issues:
   - It incorrectly tries to replace characters in the encoded string `s` directly, which is not necessary.
   - It incorrectly handles the insertion of unique characters, leading to an incorrect output.
   - The function returns an empty string because it incorrectly sets `i` to 0 and `j` to -1 after processing, and then joins an empty list.

Given these issues, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the decoding logic required.

Correctness: **False**
