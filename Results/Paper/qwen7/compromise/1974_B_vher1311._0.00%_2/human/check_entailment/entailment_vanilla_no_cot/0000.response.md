Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not perform the necessary steps to decode the string. Instead of decoding, it attempts to modify the `unique_chars` list directly, which is not the intended approach based on the problem description.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode_string(s):
    # Step 1: Construct the auxiliary string r
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    
    # Step 2: Create a mapping from characters in s to their symmetric characters in r
    mapping = {char: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    
    # Step 3: Decode the string
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    
    return decoded_str
```

This corrected program constructs the auxiliary string `r` correctly and uses it to create a mapping for decoding. It then applies this mapping to the encoded string `s` to produce the original string `s`.
