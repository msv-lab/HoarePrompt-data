Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters; `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `s` sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code creates a set of unique characters from the string `s` and then converts this set into a sorted list. Since `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` will be a list of these unique characters sorted in ascending order. The length of `s` is at most 2 * 10^5, which means the length of `unique_chars` will be less than or equal to 2 * 10^5, but it will only contain the unique characters present in `s`.
