Output State: **i is 0, j is -1.**

Explanation: After iterating through all characters in `s`, if a character is found in `unique_chars`, it gets replaced, and `j` is decremented. If a character is not found, it gets inserted at position `i`, and both `i` and `j` are incremented. Once all characters are processed, `j` will be decremented until it becomes -1, and `i` remains at 0 since no new unique characters are added after the loop completes.
