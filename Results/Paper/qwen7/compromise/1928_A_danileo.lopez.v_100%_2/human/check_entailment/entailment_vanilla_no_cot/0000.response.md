Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. **Checking Even Sides**: It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
   - If \(a\) is even, it splits the rectangle into two equal halves along the \(a\) side, i.e., \(a1 = a2 = a / 2\).
   - If \(b\) is even, it splits the rectangle into two equal halves along the \(b\) side, i.e., \(b1 = b2 = b / 2\).
3. **Validation**: After splitting, it checks if the resulting smaller rectangles can form a different rectangle:
   - If \(a1 \neq b\), it prints "Yes" because the split allows forming a new rectangle.
   - Similarly, if \(b1 \neq a\), it also prints "Yes".
4. **Handling Odd Sides**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no valid split exists that would allow forming a different rectangle, so it prints "No".

This logic correctly handles all the given examples and follows the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
