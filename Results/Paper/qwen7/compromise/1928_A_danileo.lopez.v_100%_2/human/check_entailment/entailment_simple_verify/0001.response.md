### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain a different rectangle by cutting an \(a \times b\) rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always achieve this by cutting the rectangle in half along the even dimension and then rearranging the pieces.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle since cutting an odd dimension results in two odd dimensions, and no combination of these can form a different rectangle.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even:
     - If \(a\) is even, it checks if \(a // 2\) is not equal to \(b\). If true, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next test case.
     - If \(b\) is even, it checks if \(b // 2\) is not equal to \(a\). If true, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next test case.
     - If neither condition is met, it prints 'No'.
   - If neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is even, it directly prints 'No'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the conditions under which Bob can form a different rectangle:
     - If \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle in half along that dimension and rearrange the pieces to form a different rectangle.
     - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle since cutting an odd dimension results in two odd dimensions, and no combination of these can form a different rectangle.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where \(a\) or \(b\) is 1 (which is odd), and it correctly identifies that such cases cannot form a different rectangle.
   - However, there is a flaw in the logic when both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. The current implementation only checks if \(a // 2 \neq b\) or \(b // 2 \neq a\), but it should also consider the possibility of forming a different rectangle when both dimensions are even.

### Example Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
2
4 4
2 2
```

- For the first test case (4x4):
  - Both \(a\) and \(b\) are even.
  - The program checks if \(4 // 2 \neq 4\) or \(4 // 2 \neq 4\), which is false.
  - It prints 'No', which is incorrect because we can cut the 4x4 rectangle into two 2x4 rectangles and rearrange them to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is different from the original 4x4 rectangle.

- For the second test case (2x2):
  - Both \(a\) and \(b\) are even.
  - The program checks if \(2 // 2 \neq 2\) or \(2 // 2 \neq 2\), which is false.
  - It prints 'No', which is correct because we cannot form a different rectangle from a 2x2 rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The given program incorrectly handles the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. It should check if either \(a // 2 \neq b\) or \(b // 2 \neq a\) or if the resulting rectangles can form a different configuration. 

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
