Reasoning:
- The provided function aims to process multiple test cases, where for each test case, it counts the minimum number of characters to be removed to make the string beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "map" or "pie".
- The function iterates through the string `a` and checks every possible substring of length 3 (`a[i:i+3]`). If the substring matches "map" or "pie", it increments the counter `ans` and skips ahead by 3 characters. Otherwise, it moves to the next character.
- However, the logic in the function only checks for "map" and "pie" in substrings of length 3. This approach is incomplete because it fails to account for cases where "map" or "pie" might appear in different positions within the string, such as overlapping or non-contiguous substrings.
- For example, the string "ppiee" should be considered beautiful since it does not contain "map" or "pie". But if we only check for substrings of length 3, we might miss the "pie" substring.
- Therefore, the current implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly identify all occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string.

Correctness: **False**
