Output State: **`a` must have a length of at least 9; `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index `i+3` and having a length of 3; `i` is increased by 3.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 3, and since `s` was originally a substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3, after the increment, `s` will now start from index `i+3`. The precondition that `a` must have a length of at least 9 remains unchanged.
