Output State: **`a` must have a length of at least 6, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 3 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1, `s` is updated to be the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and having a length of 3**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s = a[i:i + 3]` extracts a substring from `a` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3, and assigns it to `s`. The values of `a`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `s` is determined by the substring of `a` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3.
