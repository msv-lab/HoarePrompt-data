Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, but since it is a placeholder and does not affect the state directly, we focus on the other variables mentioned in the state description.

2. **Understand the state description**: The state at the end of the previous iteration includes:
   - `a`: the new input string
   - `n`: the new input integer (unchanged)
   - `ans`: the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`
   - `i`: the last index processed plus 3 (if the last valid substring was 'map' or 'pie'), or `i` as the last index processed plus 1 (if the last valid substring was neither 'map' nor 'pie')
   - `s`: the last substring checked, which would be `a[i:i + 3]`

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again based on the input `n`.
   - Since `n` remains unchanged, it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - The loop will process the string `a` again, starting from the last index processed (`i`) plus 1.
   - The `ans` will be updated based on the new substring checks.
   - The `i` will be updated to reflect the new starting index for the next check.
   - The `s` will be the new substring checked, which is `a[i:i + 3]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should include:
- `a`: the same new input string
- `n`: the same new input integer
- `ans`: the updated count of occurrences of 'map' or 'pie'
- `i`: the last index processed plus 1 (to start checking from the next character)
- `s`: the new substring `a[i:i + 3]`

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`a` is the new input string, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is the last index processed plus 1, and `s` is the new substring `a[i:i + 3]`**.
