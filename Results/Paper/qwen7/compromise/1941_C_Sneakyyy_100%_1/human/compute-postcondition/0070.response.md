Output State: **`a` is a new input string and len(`a`) must be greater than 3, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 1 and having length 3.**

Explanation: The code `s = a[i:i + 3]` slices the string `a` starting from index `i` (which is 1) and extracts a substring of length 3. The lengths and types of other variables remain unchanged.
