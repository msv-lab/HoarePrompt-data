Postcondition: `a` is a new input string with a length greater than 6, `n` is the new input integer, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `i` is either 7 or 5, `s` is a substring of `a` starting from index 7 or 4 and having a length of 3. If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is set to 1 and `i` is set to 7. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `i` is set to 5.
