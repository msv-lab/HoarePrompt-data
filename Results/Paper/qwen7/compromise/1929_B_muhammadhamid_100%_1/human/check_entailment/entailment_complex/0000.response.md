Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if the logic implemented matches the requirements of the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Problem Statement Recap:
- Given a square grid of size \( n \times n \).
- The goal is to color the minimum number of cells such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

### Key Points from the Code:
1. **Case \( k = 1 \)**: The code correctly prints `1` since coloring just one cell can satisfy the condition.
2. **Case \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \)**: This simplifies to \( k \leq 4n - 4 \). The code prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
3. **Case \( k > 4n - 4 \)**: The code prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).

### Analysis:
- The formula \( 2(n + (n - 2)) = 4n - 4 \) is derived from considering both main diagonals and anti-diagonals. Each diagonal can be covered by coloring cells in a strategic manner.
- The ceiling function \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) ensures that we round up to the nearest whole number when \( k \) is odd, which is necessary because we cannot color half a cell.
- For \( k > 4n - 4 \), the formula \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) ensures that we cover the remaining diagonals by adding one more cell if needed.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Test Case 1**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)
  - \( 4 \leq 4 \cdot 3 - 4 \) (i.e., \( 4 \leq 8 \)), so \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \).
  - The code prints `2`, which is correct.
- **Test Case 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - \( 3 \leq 4 \cdot 3 - 4 \) (i.e., \( 3 \leq 8 \)), so \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \).
  - The code prints `2`, which is correct.
- **Test Case 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)
  - \( 10 > 4 \cdot 3 - 4 \) (i.e., \( 10 > 8 \)), so \( \frac{10}{2} + 1 = 6 \).
  - The code prints `6`, which is correct.
- **Test Case 4**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)
  - \( 9 > 4 \cdot 3 - 4 \) (i.e., \( 9 > 8 \)), so \( \frac{9}{2} + 1 = 5 \).
  - The code prints `5`, which is correct.
- **Test Case 5**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)
  - \( 7 \leq 4 \cdot 4 - 4 \) (i.e., \( 7 \leq 12 \)), so \( \lceil \frac{7}{2} \rceil = 4 \).
  - The code prints `4`, which is correct.
- **Test Case 6**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)
  - \( 11 > 4 \cdot 7 - 4 \) (i.e., \( 11 > 24 - 4 \)), so \( \frac{11}{2} + 1 = 6 \).
  - The code prints `6`, which is correct.
- **Test Case 7**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - \( 3 \leq 4 \cdot 2 - 4 \) (i.e., \( 3 \leq 4 \)), so \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \).
  - The code prints `2`, which is correct.

Since the logic in the code matches the problem statement and the examples provided, the program is correct.
