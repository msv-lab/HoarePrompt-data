You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.

        n, k = map(int, input().split())

            continue

            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the conditions given within the loop. For each test case, if \( k = 1 \), it will print 1. If \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \), it will print \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). Otherwise, it will print \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).
    #
    #This output state will be determined by the values of \( n \) and \( k \) entered for each test case during the loop's execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution uses a loop to read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It handles the special case where \( k = 1 \) by printing `1`.
   - For other cases, it checks if \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \). This simplifies to \( k \leq 4n - 4 \).
     - If true, it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
     - Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic seems to handle the simplest case correctly (`k = 1`).
   - The condition \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) is used to determine when to use \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
   - The formula \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) is used when \( k > 4n - 4 \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When \( k = 1 \), the solution prints `1`, which is correct.
   - For \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), the solution uses \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \), which is generally correct because each cell can contribute to at most 2 diagonals.
   - For \( k > 4n - 4 \), the solution uses \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \), which ensures that we cover all required diagonals.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - The examples provided in the problem statement match the expected outputs based on the given logic.

### Conclusion:
The given solution appears to handle all edge cases and examples correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
