Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `R` is 25001, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `R` to `x`. Given that `x` is 25001, `R` is updated to 25001. All other variables (`numCuts`, `L`, `x`, and `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
