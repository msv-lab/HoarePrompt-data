Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `L = x` assigns the value of `x` to `L`. Given that `x` is defined as `(L + R) // 2`, `L` now holds this value. The other variables (`numCuts` and `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
