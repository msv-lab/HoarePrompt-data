Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted, `adj[b]` now contains `a` and includes the appended value `a`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. This means that the list `adj[b]` now contains the value `a` twice (since it was already there before the append operation). The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is incremented by 1. The condition `i` is less than `n - 1` remains valid as no changes were made to `i` or `n`.
