Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current values**:
   - `R` is 100001.
   - `L` is 1.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `R - L > 1` must be true.
   - Currently, `R - L = 100001 - 1 = 100000`, which is already greater than 1.
   - Therefore, no adjustment to `R` or `L` is necessary because the condition is already satisfied.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the loop condition is already met with the current values of `R` and `L`, no state adjustments are required.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`numCuts` is 0, `R` is 100001, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from user input, `b` is an integer from user input, for every node `i` (where `1 ≤ i ≤ n`), `adj[i]` contains a list of all nodes directly connected to node `i`, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 1**
