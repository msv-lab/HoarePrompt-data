Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the first integer from user input; `b` is the second integer from user input; `adj[b]` now contains `a`**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains the value `b`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will contain both `b` and `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
