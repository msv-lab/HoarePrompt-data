Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is the final value of `L` after the loop, `R` is the final value of `R` after the loop, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the values of `L` and `R` will converge to the same value, as the loop continues to narrow down the range until `R - L` is no longer greater than 1. The variable `numCuts` remains 0 because it is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration of the loop and is not modified within the loop body. The variable `leftover` will hold the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which is made once per loop iteration and does not change between iterations.
