Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop condition is `range(n - 1)`, which means the loop will run as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n - 1` initially.

3. **Initial Values for `i` and `n`**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n - 1`.
   - To ensure the loop runs at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (because `i` starts from 0, `n - 1` should be at least 1).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 so that `i` can be incremented up to `n - 2`.
   - `i` will start from 0, so no adjustment is needed for `i` itself.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
