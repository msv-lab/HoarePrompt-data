Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted**.

This means that the code reads two integers from the standard input (using `sys.stdin.readline().split()`) and splits them into a list, then unpacks that list into variables `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are now the integers corresponding to the first and second numbers inputted respectively.
