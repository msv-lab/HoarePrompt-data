Based on the initial state described:

- `numCuts` is 0.
- `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.
- `L` is a value between 1 and `R` (inclusive), where `R` is 100001.
- `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` after the loop terminates.

The loop in the code adjusts `L` and `R` such that the difference `R - L` is no more than 1. The final value of `L` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to the initial value of `R` because the loop continues as long as `R - L > 1`.

Given that `R` is 100001 and the loop ensures that `L` and `R` converge to the same value, the final value of `L` will be 100001.

Output: **100001**
