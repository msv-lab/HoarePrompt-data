Output State: **All integers `a` and `b` assigned within the loop are correctly added to their respective adjacency lists `adj[a]` and `adj[b]`. The variable `i` equals `n - 2` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`), indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.**

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be `n - 2` because the loop runs `n - 1` times (from `0` to `n-2`).
- For every pair of integers `(a, b)` read from the standard input, `a` is added to the adjacency list of `b` and `b` is added to the adjacency list of `a`.
- This process is repeated `n - 1` times, ensuring that each edge in the graph is correctly represented in the adjacency list structure.
- All other variables (`numCuts`, `L`, `R`, `leftover`, `z`, `adj`, `n`, `k`) remain in their final states as they were not modified within the loop.
