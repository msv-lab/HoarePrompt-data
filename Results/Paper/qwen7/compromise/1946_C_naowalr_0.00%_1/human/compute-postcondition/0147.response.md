Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), n and k (positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 for each test case), and adj (a list of lists where adj[i] contains the list of vertices adjacent to vertex i). The function does not return anything but processes the input data according to the given constraints and prints the output to stdout.**
