Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is 1, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. It does not modify the values of `n`, `i`, `adj[a]`, or `adj[b]`. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `adj[a]`, and `adj[b]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
