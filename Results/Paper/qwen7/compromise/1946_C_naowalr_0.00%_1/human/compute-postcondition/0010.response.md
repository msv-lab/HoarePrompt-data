Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is 1, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, b]`**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contains `[b, b]`. After appending `b` again, `adj[a]` will contain `[b, b, b]`. However, since `b` is already present twice, appending it again doesn't change the unique elements in the list. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation. The adjacency list `adj[b]` initially contains `[a]`, and after the append operation, it remains `[a]` because the append operation only affects `adj[a]`.
