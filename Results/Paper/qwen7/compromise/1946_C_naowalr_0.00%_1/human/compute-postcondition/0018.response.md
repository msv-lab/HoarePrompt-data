Output State: **`n` remains an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is now `n-2`, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[a]` contains a list of all nodes connected to node `a`, and `adj[b]` contains a list of all nodes connected to node `b`; L is 1.**

Explanation: The line `L = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `L`. This does not affect any of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `adj[a]`, and `adj[b]` remain unchanged.
