Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is 1, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b, a]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, b]`**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list stored in `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[a, b]`. After appending `a`, `adj[b]` will contain `[a, b, a]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
