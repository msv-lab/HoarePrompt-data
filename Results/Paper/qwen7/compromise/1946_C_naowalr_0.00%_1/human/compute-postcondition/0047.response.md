Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is a value such that `L <= R`, and `R` is a value such that `L <= R`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the condition `R - L > 1` will no longer hold true, meaning `R` will be incremented to the next integer value such that `R` is just greater than `L`. The variable `numCuts` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop. The `leftover` value is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which is not altered by the loop. The values of `L` and `R` will be adjusted until they are as close as possible while maintaining `R - L > 1`, ensuring that `L` and `R` are consecutive integers with `L` being the lower bound and `R` being the upper bound of the search range.
