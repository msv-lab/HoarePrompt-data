Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is the final value of `L` after the loop, `R` is the final value of `R` after the loop, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `L` will be the lower bound of the binary search range where the condition `numCuts > k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover >= x`) is satisfied, and `R` will be the upper bound. The variable `numCuts` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop body and only `L` and `R` are updated based on the condition. The value of `leftover` is determined by the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which is not affected by the loop iterations.
