Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the first integer from user input; `b` is the second integer from user input; `adj[b]` now contains `a` appended to it; `i` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` is `n - 2` is still valid. The list `adj[b]` now includes the value of `a` appended to it.
