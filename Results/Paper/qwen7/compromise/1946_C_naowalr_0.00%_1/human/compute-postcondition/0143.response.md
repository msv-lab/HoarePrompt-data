Output State: `L` is 50001, `R` is 50002, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed multiple times, the values of `L` and `R` will converge such that `R - L` becomes 1. Given the nature of the loop, where `x` is set to the midpoint of `L` and `R` and then `L` or `R` is updated based on the conditions, it's clear that `L` and `R` will eventually be consecutive numbers. Since the loop continues as long as `R - L > 1`, once `R - L` equals 1, the loop will terminate. The final values of `L` and `R` will be the two consecutive numbers around the midpoint calculated throughout the iterations, which in this case are 50001 and 50002. The value of `numCuts` remains 0 because the conditions inside the loop did not allow `numCuts` to increment. The values of `x` and `leftover` reflect the last iteration's calculations.
