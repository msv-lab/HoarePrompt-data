Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is either 25001 or 50001, `R` is either 50002 or 25001, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is now (L + R) // 2.**

Explanation: The code `numCuts = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `numCuts`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `L`, `R`, `x`, and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial states. Additionally, `x` is updated to be the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. Given the possible values of `L` and `R`, `x` could be either 37501 or 25001, but since the exact values of `L` and `R` are not specified, we keep it as `(L + R) // 2`.
