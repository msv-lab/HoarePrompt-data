Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < x`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `x` must be greater than 0, the condition `i < x` is true.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute again.
   - After the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will become 1.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
   - `x` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - `l` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input**.
