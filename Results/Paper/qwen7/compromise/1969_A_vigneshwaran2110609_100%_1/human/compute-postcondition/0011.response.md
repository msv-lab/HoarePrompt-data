Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and either `l[l[i] - 1]` is equal to `i + 1` (in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement), or there is no change to the values of `i`, `x`, and `l` since there is no else part.
