Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    x = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    for i in range(0, x):
        if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
            flag = True
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 9, x is greater than 9, flag remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 20, `x` is at least 10, and if `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, then `flag` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l[l[i] - 1]` does not equal `i + 1`, then the conditions remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 49, `x` is 49, `flag` is either True or False depending on whether the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` was met for any `i` from 0 to 48. If the condition was met for any `i`, `flag` is True; otherwise, `flag` remains False.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i` = 0 to `i` = 48), the value of `i` will be 49, and `x` will also be 49 because the loop runs exactly 49 times (from 0 to 48 inclusive). The variable `flag` will be True if there was any index `i` where `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `i + 1`, and it will be False otherwise. The list `l` and the initial value of `x` (which is set to `i + 1` at the start of each iteration) do not change outside the loop's scope.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
