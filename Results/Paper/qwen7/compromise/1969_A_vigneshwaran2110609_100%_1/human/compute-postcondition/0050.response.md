Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 20, and `x` is at least 10.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop is when `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`.

3. **Determine the new state of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 21.

4. **Determine the new state of `n`**:
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body. Since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Check the condition for breaking out of the loop**:
   - We need to check if `l[l[21] - 1] == 22` (since `i + 1` would be 21 + 1 = 22).
   - If this condition is true, `flag` is set to `True`, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 21.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `x` remains at least 10.
   - The condition for `flag` and the break statement will depend on the value of `l[l[21] - 1]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 21, `x` is at least 10, and if `l[l[21] - 1]` equals `22`, then `flag` is set to `True` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `l[l[21] - 1]` does not equal `22`, then the conditions remain unchanged.**
