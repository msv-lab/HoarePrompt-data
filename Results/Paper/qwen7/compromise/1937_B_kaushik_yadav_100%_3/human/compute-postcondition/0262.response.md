Postcondition: **`counter` is 1, `ans` is the concatenation of the first character of either `a` or `b` and all characters from `a` or `b` up to the last character, `j` is 2, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and the first characters of `a` and `b` at index 0 are not equal, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` is true, then `counter` becomes 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains 2, and the other variables retain their original states as described in the precondition.
