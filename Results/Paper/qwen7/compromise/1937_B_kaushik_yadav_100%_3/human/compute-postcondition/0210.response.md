Output State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the first character of either `a` or `b` followed by `b[i]`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is less than `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` updates the value of `ans` by appending the `i-th` character from string `b` to the existing value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `i` must be less than `len(a)` and `len(a)` must be greater than 0 is still valid. The value of `ans` now includes the first character of `b` followed by the `i-th` character of `b`.
