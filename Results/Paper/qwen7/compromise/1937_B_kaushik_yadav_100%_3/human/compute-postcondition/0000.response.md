Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are given, where each `a_{ij}` is either 0 or 1; the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`.**

This output state indicates that the initial conditions remain unchanged except for setting the input method to `sys.stdin.readline`.
