Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing characters from either `a` or `b` based on the conditions within the loop, `work` is set to `False`, `j` is 1**.

The value of `counter` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 or 2 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
