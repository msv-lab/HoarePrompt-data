Output State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the first character of either `a` or `b` concatenated with `a[i]`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans += a[i]` appends the character `a[i]` to the string `ans`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 (since `i` must be less than `len(a)`). All other variables remain unchanged.
