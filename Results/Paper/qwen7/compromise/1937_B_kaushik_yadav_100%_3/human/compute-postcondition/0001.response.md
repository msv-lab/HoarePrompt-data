Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are given, where each `a_{ij}` is either 0 or 1; the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`, `t` is an input integer.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been updated to the value of the integer input, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
