Postcondition: `counter` is 1, `ans` is the concatenation of the first character of either `a` or `b` and all characters from `a` or `b` up to the last character, `j` is 0, `i` is `len(a)`, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of whether `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1' or not.
