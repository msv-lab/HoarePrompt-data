Postcondition: `counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is a string, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is 2, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0. If `work` is `True`, then `ans` is the first character of `a` or updated to `ans` plus `b[1]` if `i + 1` equals the length of `a`, otherwise `ans` remains the first character of `a`. If `work` is `False`, then `ans` is the first character of `b`.
