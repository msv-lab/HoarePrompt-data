To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `i < len(a)`.

Given the current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a non-empty string
- `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input
- `ans` is a string containing either the first character of `b` or the first character of `a`
- `work` is set to `False`

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `i < len(a)` must be true. Currently, `i` is 1, so for the loop to continue, `len(a)` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(a)`.

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` must have length greater than 1, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing either the first character of `b` or the first character of `a`, and `work` is set to `False`**
