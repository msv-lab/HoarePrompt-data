Postcondition: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is the first character of either `a` or `b`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is 2, `work` is `False`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.** 

This means that after the if-else block executes, `counter` remains either 1 or 2, `ans` will be the first character of either `a` or `b` depending on the condition, `j` remains as `len(a) - 1`, `i` is set to 2, `work` is set to `False`, and the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, and the length constraint of `a`) remain unchanged from their preconditions.
