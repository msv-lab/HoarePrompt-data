Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `counter` is an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, `i` is 0, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is set to `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `counter` is an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is the first character of `a` if `work` is `True` and `b[0]` if `work` is `False`, `work` is set to `False` if `b[i] < a[i + 1]` and `True` otherwise when `work` is `True`, `i` is 1 if `work` is `False`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `counter` is an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the value of `work`: it starts with the first character of `a` followed by either `b[i]` if `work` is `False` or `b[0]` followed by `a[i]` if `work` is `True`, `work` is set to `False` if `b[i] < a[i + 1]` and `True` otherwise when `work` is `True`, `i` is either `2` if `work` is `False` or `len(a) - 1` if `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0. If `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, we break out of the loop or if statement; otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1 if `work` is `False` and remains `len(a) - 1` if `work` is `True`. If `work` is `False`, `ans` is updated by adding `b[i]` to its current value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `counter` is an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the value of `work`: it starts with the first character of `a` followed by either `b[0]` if `work` is `False` or `b[0]` followed by `a[i]` if `work` is `True`, `work` is set to `False` if `b[i] < a[i + 1]` and `True` otherwise, `i` is either `2` if `work` is `False` or `len(a) - 1` if `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and `len(a)` must be greater than 2. Depending on the value of `work`, `ans` is updated by either adding `a[i]` to itself, adding `b[i]` to itself, or adding `b[i]` to the end of `ans`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, `work` is set to `False` and `i` is set to `2`; otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
