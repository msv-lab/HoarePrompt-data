Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is an empty string, `work` is set to True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty string, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing either the first character of `b` or the first character of `a`, and `work` is set to False. If the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`, then `work` remains True and `ans` is updated to the character at index `i` in `b`. Otherwise, `work` is set to False and `ans` is updated to the first character of `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `i` is either 2 or the length of `a` minus 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` must have length greater than 1, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing either the first character of `a` followed by `a[i-1]` when `i` is the length of `a` minus 1, or the first character of `b` when `i` is 2, and `work` is set to `False`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `ans` is increased by either `b[i]` or `a[i]`, `i` is set to `len(a)` if it was `len(a) - 1`, and if `i` was `len(a) - 1`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `i` is increased by 1. If `work` is true, `i` is set to `len(a)` if it was `len(a) - 1`; otherwise, `i` is increased by 1. In the else case, `ans` is increased by `b[len(a)]`, and `i` is set to `len(a) + 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
