Output State: **`counter` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is an empty string, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is 0, `work` is `True`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The line `work = True` sets the variable `work` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
