Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` must have length greater than 1, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `b`, and `work` is set to `False`.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
