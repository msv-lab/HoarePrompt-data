Output State: **`ans` is increased by `b[i]`, `i` is set to `len(a)` if it was `len(a) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` increases the value of `ans` by `b[i]`. Additionally, if the previous value of `i` was `len(a) - 1`, then `i` is set to `len(a)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
