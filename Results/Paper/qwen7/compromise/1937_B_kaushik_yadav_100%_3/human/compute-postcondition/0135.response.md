Output State: **`counter` is an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `a` is updated to the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is constructed based on the value of `work`: it starts with the first character of `a` followed by either `b[i]` if `work` is `False` or `b[0]` followed by `a[i]` if `work` is `True`, `work` is set to `False` if `b[i] < a[i + 1]` and `True` otherwise when `work` is `True`, `i` is either `2` if `work` is `False` or `len(a) - 1` if `work` is `True`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is updated by adding `b[i]` to itself, and `len(a)` must be greater than 2.**

In more natural language, the output state is as follows:
- The `counter` remains an integer between 1 and `len(a) - 1`, inclusive.
- `t` is decremented by 1.
- `n` remains the integer input by the user.
- `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `ans` is updated by appending `b[i]` to itself (where `i` is determined based on the value of `work`).
- `work` is set to `False` if `b[i] < a[i + 1]` and `True` otherwise.
- `i` is either `2` if `work` is `False` or `len(a) - 1` if `work` is `True`.
- `j` is `len(a) - 2`.
- `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.
- `len(a)` must still be greater than 2.
