Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated for each iteration of the loop. For each line of input, if the first number (a) is odd and the second number (b) is odd, or if a/2 equals b or b/2 equals a, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'. The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
