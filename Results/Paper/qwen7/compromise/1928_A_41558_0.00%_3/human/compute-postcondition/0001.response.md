State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `n`, and the range function which implicitly uses `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `n` must be greater than 0 because the `range(n)` function generates a sequence from 0 to `n-1`.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts, as `range(n)` starts counting from 0.
4. The value of `t` (which is between 1 and \(10^4\)) does not affect the loop's execution condition directly, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
