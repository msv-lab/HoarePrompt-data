### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Bob needs to determine if he can obtain a different rectangle by cutting a given \(a \times b\) rectangle into two smaller rectangles and reassembling them.
- Two rectangles are considered the same if one can be rotated to match the other.
- The program should output "YES" if Bob can obtain a different rectangle, and "NO" otherwise.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The program reads the number of test cases, `n`.
- For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
- It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints "NO".
- It checks if \(a/2\) equals \(b\) or \(b/2\) equals \(a\). If so, it prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES".

#### Analysis:
1. **Case Where Both Dimensions Are Odd:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no reassembly into a different rectangle is possible, hence it prints "NO".

2. **Case Where One Dimension Is Exactly Half of the Other:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if \(a/2\) equals \(b\) or \(b/2\) equals \(a\), no reassembly into a different rectangle is possible, hence it prints "NO".

3. **Case Where Both Dimensions Are Even:**
   - The program incorrectly handles this case. According to the problem description, if both dimensions are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and reassemble them into a different rectangle.
   - For example, for the test case \(2 \times 4\):
     - Both dimensions are even.
     - The program should output "YES" because Bob can cut the \(2 \times 4\) rectangle into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and reassemble them into a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle.
     - However, the program outputs "NO" because it does not account for the case where both dimensions are even.

4. **General Case:**
   - The program fails to handle the general case where both dimensions are even but do not satisfy the specific conditions checked (i.e., both being odd or one being exactly half of the other).

Given the analysis, the program indeed fails to correctly handle the case where both dimensions are even, leading to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where both dimensions are even.

**Final: False**
