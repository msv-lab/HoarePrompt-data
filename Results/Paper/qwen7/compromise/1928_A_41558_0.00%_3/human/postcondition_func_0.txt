The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, or if \(a/2\) equals \(b\) or \(b/2\) equals \(a\). If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function reads the number of test cases from user input, then iterates through each test case, performing the specified checks and printing the result.
