The loop condition is based on the length of the deque `q`. For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must contain at least one element. Since the loop body processes elements from `q` and potentially adds new nodes to `q`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `q`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial Condition**: The loop continues as long as `len(q)` is non-zero.
2. **Loop Execution**: During each iteration, elements are processed from `q`, and potentially new nodes are added back to `q`.
3. **End of Previous Iteration**: After the previous iteration, `q` contains all nodes that were added during the loop executions, and `vis[node]` is set to 1 for all nodes that are reachable from `ver`.
4. **Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `q` contains at least one element.

**Answer:**
State: **`q` must contain at least one element**
