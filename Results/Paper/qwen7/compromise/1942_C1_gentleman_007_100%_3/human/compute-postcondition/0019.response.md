Output State: **`vis[node]` is 1, `node` is the next node in `graph[ver]`, and `q` contains the next node appended.**

Explanation: The code `vis[node] = 1` updates the value of `vis[node]` to 1. The other variables (`node`, which is the next node in `graph[ver]`, and `q` which contains the next node appended) remain unchanged from their initial states.
