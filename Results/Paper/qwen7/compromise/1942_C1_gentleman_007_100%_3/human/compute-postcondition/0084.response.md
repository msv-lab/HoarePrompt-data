Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Loop Head
The loop condition is `while i != 0 and j != 0:`. This means the loop continues as long as both `i` and `j` are non-zero.

### Current States
- `i` is either 0 or -1.
- `j` is a non-zero value.
- `a` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `x` is the length of `a`.
- `b` is a list of integers representing the indices of characters in the string `a`.
- `y` remains 0.
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`.
- `l` is a list containing the character at index `-1` of `a` if `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]` or `dp[i - 1][j]`, otherwise `l` remains an empty list.

### Analysis
For the loop to continue, both `i` and `j` must be non-zero. 

- `i` is currently either 0 or -1. To make the loop continue, `i` must be changed from 0 or -1 to a non-zero value.
- `j` is already a non-zero value, so no change is needed for `j`.

### Adjusted States
We need to adjust the state such that `i` becomes a non-zero value while keeping `j` as a non-zero value.

### Final State
State: **`i` must be a non-zero value, `j` is a non-zero value, `a` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `x` is the length of `a`, `b` is a list of integers representing the indices of characters in the string `a`, `y` remains 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, and `l` is a list containing the character at index `-1` of `a` if `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]` or `dp[i - 1][j]`, otherwise `l` remains an empty list.**

This ensures that the loop condition `i != 0 and j != 0` is satisfied for the next iteration.
