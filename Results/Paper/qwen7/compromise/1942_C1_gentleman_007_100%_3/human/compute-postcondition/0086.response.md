Output State: **`i` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `j` is a non-zero value, `a` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `x` is the length of `a`, `b` is a list of integers representing the indices of characters in the string `a`, `y` remains 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, and `l` is a list containing the character at index `-1` of `a` if `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]` or `dp[i - 1][j]`, otherwise `l` remains an empty list.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is decremented by 1, making it a non-zero value decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
