Output State: **All nodes in `graph[ver]` have been visited.**

Explanation: Given that the loop continues to execute as long as there are unvisited nodes in `graph[ver]`, and each iteration marks an unvisited node as visited by setting `vis[node]` to 1 and appending it to `q`, the loop will continue until every node in `graph[ver]` has been visited at least once. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, all nodes in `graph[ver]` will have their corresponding `vis` flag set to 1, indicating they have been visited.
