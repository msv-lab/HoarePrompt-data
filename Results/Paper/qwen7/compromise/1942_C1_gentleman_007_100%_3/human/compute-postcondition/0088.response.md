Output State: **`i` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `j` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `a` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `x` is the length of `a`, `b` is a list of integers representing the indices of characters in the string `a`, `y` remains 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions `(len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1)`, and `l` remains an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `j -= 1` decreases the value of `j` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `j` is now a non-zero value decreased by 1, while `i` remains a non-zero value decreased by 1 from its initial state.
