Output State: **`q` now contains all elements except the first one (since `ver = q.popleft()` removed the first element), `ver` is the first element that was removed from `q`, and all elements in `graph[ver]` that were not previously visited have their corresponding `vis` flag set to 1.**

This means that the queue `q` has lost its first element, `ver` now holds the value of that first element, and all unvisited neighbors of `ver` in the graph have had their `vis` flags set to 1.
