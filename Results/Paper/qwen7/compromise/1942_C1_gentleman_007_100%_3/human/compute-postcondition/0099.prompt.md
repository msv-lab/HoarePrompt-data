You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer representing the upper limit for finding prime numbers.
def func_11(num):
    prime = [(True) for i in range(num + 1)]
    Highest_Prime = [(0) for i in range(num + 1)]
    Lowest_Prime = [(0) for i in range(num + 1)]
    prime[0] = prime[1] = False
    p = 2
    while p <= num:
        if prime[p] == True:
            Lowest_Prime[p] = p
            Highest_Prime[p] = p
            for i in range(2 * p, num + 1, p):
                prime[i] = False
                Highest_Prime[i] = p
                if Lowest_Prime[i] == 0:
                    Lowest_Prime[i] = p
        
        p += 1
        
    #State: All elements in the `prime` list are `False`, `Highest_Prime` and `Lowest_Prime` lists are fully populated with prime factors for each index from 2 to `num`, and `p` is greater than `num`.
    p = []
    for i in range(num + 1):
        if prime[i]:
            p.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `p` is a list containing all prime numbers up to and including `num`, `i` is `num + 1`, and `num` is greater than or equal to 0.
    #
    #In natural language: The list `p` will contain all prime numbers from 0 up to and including the value of `num`. The variable `i` will be set to `num + 1` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `num + 1`. The variable `num` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
    return p
    #The program returns a list `p` containing all prime numbers up to and including the value of `num`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter num, which is a positive integer representing the upper limit for finding prime numbers. It returns a list p containing all prime numbers up to and including the value of num.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `p` containing all prime numbers up to and including the value of `num`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
