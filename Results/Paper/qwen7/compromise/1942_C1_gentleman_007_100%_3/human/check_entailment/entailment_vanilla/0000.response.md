Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the code correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices. The key points are:
- The polygon has `n` sides.
- Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.
- We can add up to `y` additional vertices (which is 0 in this version).
- We need to maximize the number of triangles that can be formed.

### Code Analysis

The provided code includes many helper functions, but none of them seem directly relevant to solving the problem at hand. The problem requires combinatorial logic to determine how to maximize the number of triangles, but the code does not contain any function that addresses this requirement.

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Vertices and Triangles**: To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices. Given `x` vertices, we need to determine how many sets of 3 vertices can be formed without intersecting diagonals.
2. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: The problem can be simplified by understanding that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in an `n`-sided polygon is `(n-2)` when all vertices are considered.

Given that `y = 0`, we cannot add any additional vertices. Therefore, the problem reduces to determining how many triangles can be formed using the `x` vertices Bessie has chosen.

### Solution Approach

To solve this, we can use the fact that in a polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is `n-2`. However, since we only have `x` vertices, the maximum number of triangles we can form is limited by the number of ways we can choose 3 vertices from `x`.

The formula to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 vertices from `x` is given by the combination formula \( \binom{x}{3} \).

### Conclusion

The provided code does not contain any function that calculates the number of triangles that can be formed. Instead, it contains a variety of utility functions that do not address the core problem.

Therefore, the given code is **not correct** for solving the problem as stated.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
