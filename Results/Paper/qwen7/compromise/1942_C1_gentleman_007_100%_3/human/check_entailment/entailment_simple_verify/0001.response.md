### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code step-by-step:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices.
   - The polygon has `n` sides.
   - Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.
   - We can add up to `y` additional vertices (which is 0 in this version).
   - The key is to maximize the number of triangles that can be formed using these vertices.

2. **Core Logic**:
   - The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in an `n`-sided polygon is `n-2`.
   - However, since Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices and we cannot add any more (`y = 0`), the number of triangles is limited by the number of ways to choose 3 vertices from `x`.

3. **Combination Formula**:
   - The number of ways to choose 3 vertices from `x` is given by the combination formula \( \binom{x}{3} \).

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code includes many utility functions that do not directly address the problem.
   - The most relevant part of the code is the calculation of the number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

5. **Relevant Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   ans = x - 2
   ```
   - This line of code directly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using the `x` chosen vertices, assuming no additional vertices can be added (`y = 0`).

6. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly initializes `ans` to `x - 2`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices.
   - The rest of the code is irrelevant to the problem and does not affect the final result.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices. The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.
