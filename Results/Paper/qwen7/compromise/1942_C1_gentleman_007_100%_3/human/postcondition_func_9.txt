The function accepts a list of integers `l` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list. After the function executes, it modifies the list `l` by using its elements to compute the GCD, storing the result in the variable `a`, which is then returned. The length of the list `l` remains unchanged.
