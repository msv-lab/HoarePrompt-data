Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to replace each integer from 1 to \( n \) with the sum of its digits.
   - We need to find the sum of these new values.

2. **Given Program:**
   ```python
   soma = 0
   N = int(input())
   for _ in range(N):
       n = int(input())
       for i in range(n):
           soma += func_1(i)
   print(soma)

   def func_1(n):
       return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))
   ```

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - `soma` is initialized to 0.
   - `N` is read from input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` is read from input, representing the upper limit for the sequence of numbers.
   - A loop runs from 0 to \( n-1 \), and for each value `i`, `func_1(i)` is called and added to `soma`.
   - `func_1(n)` returns the sum of the digits of `n`.

4. **Issues Identified:**
   - The loop should run from 1 to \( n \) instead of 0 to \( n-1 \). This is because the problem specifies replacing integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The function `func_1` is correctly defined to compute the sum of digits of a number.
   - The logic for adding the sum of digits to `soma` inside the inner loop is incorrect. It should be outside the inner loop and only once per test case.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    soma = sum(func_1(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
    print(soma)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in the loop range and where the sum is accumulated. After correcting these issues, the program will correctly solve the problem.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
