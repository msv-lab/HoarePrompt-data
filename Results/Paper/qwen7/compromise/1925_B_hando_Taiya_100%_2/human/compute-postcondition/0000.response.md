Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, x is an input integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The constraints on `x` and `n` are also preserved.
