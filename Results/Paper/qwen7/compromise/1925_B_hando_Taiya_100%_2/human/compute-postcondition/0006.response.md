Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values within a loop or through other means (not specified here). It iterates over a range defined by t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each iteration, it accepts x and n as positive integers (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x) and returns a value based on these inputs.**

This means the function indirectly accepts parameters `x` and `n` for each of the `t` iterations, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3. For each iteration, it processes `x` and `n` and returns a value based on their relationship.
