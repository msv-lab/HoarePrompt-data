Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum balance. The approach in `func_1` does not correctly determine the maximum GCD (balance) for splitting the problem difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding GCD**: The function iterates through numbers from 1 to the square root of `x` to find divisors but does not correctly ensure that the GCD of `n` numbers can be achieved. It checks divisibility but doesn't ensure that the GCD of `n` sub-problems can be formed.

2. **GCD Calculation**: The logic should focus on finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `n`, which would be the optimal way to split `x` into `n` parts with the highest possible GCD.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    # The maximum balance is the GCD of x and n
    ans = gcd(x, n)
    print(ans)
```

This version directly computes the GCD of `x` and `n`, which is the optimal way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems with the highest possible balance.
