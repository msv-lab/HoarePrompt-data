Output State: **`ans` is the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 99`, `j` is the third element of `array`, `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s[j]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. Since `j` is the third element of `array`, `s[j]` is now one more than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged, so `ans` is still the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 99`.
