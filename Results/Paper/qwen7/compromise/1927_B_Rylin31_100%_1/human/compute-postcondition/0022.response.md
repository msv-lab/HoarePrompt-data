Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the iterable `array`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop will start with the first element of `array`. Therefore, `j` should be set to the first element of `array`.

3. **Determine the state of `array`**: Since the loop will iterate over each element of `array`, `array` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Other variables**: The variables `i`, `ans`, `s`, and `l` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `j` should be set to the first element of `array`.
- `array` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is an empty string, `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `l` is an input integer, `j` is the first element of `array`**.
