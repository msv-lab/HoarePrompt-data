Output State: **`ans` is the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 99`, `j` is the third element of `array`, `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s[j]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` updates the value of `ans` by concatenating the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97 + 2` (since `chr(s[j] + 97)` was previously `s[j] + 98` and now it becomes `s[j] + 99`). Additionally, `s[j]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
