Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` as the variable that iterates over the elements of `array`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 97` + 1.
   - `j` is the first element of `array`.
   - `array` is a non-empty list of integers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more elements in `array` to iterate over. After each iteration, `j` takes the next element from `array`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the first element of `array` at the start of the loop, after the first iteration, `j` will be set to the second element of `array`.
   - `ans` will be recalculated based on the new value of `j` (which is now the second element of `array`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the following:
- `j` will be the second element of `array`.
- `ans` will be the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 97` + 1, where `j` is now the second element of `array`.

State: **`ans` is the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 97` + 1, `j` is the second element of `array`, `array` is a non-empty list of integers**.
