Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the iterable `array`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The variable `j` is initialized to the first element of the iterable `array` when the loop starts. Therefore, `j` will take on the values of the elements in `array` one by one.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `array`**: The `array` is a list of integers created from the input split. Since `array` is the iterable, its state (specifically, its contents) will determine how many times the loop will execute.

4. **Initial State of Other Variables**: The other variables (`i`, `l`, `s`, and `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution. They remain in their initial states unless modified within the loop body.

Given this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `j` and `array`. Specifically, `j` should be set to the first element of `array`, and `array` should contain at least one element to ensure the loop executes at least once.

**State:**
- `j` is the first element of `array`.
- `array` is a list of integers created from the input split and must contain at least one element.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is the first element of `array`, `array` is a non-empty list of integers**
