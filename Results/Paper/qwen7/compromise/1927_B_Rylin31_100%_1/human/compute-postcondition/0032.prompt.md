Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is an empty string, `array` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `l` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in array:
    ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
    s[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the index `j` in the list `s` (which is a list of `l` zeros), `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is a list of `l` zeros where the `j`-th element is now 1, `l` is an input integer, `j` is the first element of `array`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is the original character plus the character corresponding to the second element of `array` in the list `s`, `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is a list of `l` zeros where the second element of `array`-th element is now 2, `l` is an input integer, `j` is the second element of `array`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is the original character plus '2' plus '2', `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is a list of `l` zeros where the second element of `array`-th element is now 3 and the next element of `array`-th element is now 3, `l` is an input integer, `s[j]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
