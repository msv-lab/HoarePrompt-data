Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - A list `s` of size `l` (which is equal to `n`) is initialized with zeros.
   - An empty string `ans` is initialized to build the result string.

3. **Building the String:**
   - For each element `j` in the trace array:
     - The character to be added to `ans` is determined by `chr(s[j] + 97)`. Here, `s[j]` gives the count of previous occurrences of the current character, and adding `97` converts this count to the corresponding lowercase letter (since 'a' is represented by ASCII 97).
     - The value at `s[j]` is incremented by 1 after adding the character to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements in the trace array, the constructed string `ans` is printed.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example given in the problem statement:

#### Example Test Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  5
  11
  0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4
  10
  0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
  1
  0
  8
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
  8
  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  abracadabra
  codeforces
  a
  aaaaaaaa
  dijkstra
  ```

#### Verification:
1. **First Test Case:**
   - Trace: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]`
   - Constructed String: `abracadabra`
   - Explanation: 
     - `a` appears at index 4, so `s[4]` is 1.
     - `b` appears at index 5, so `s[5]` is 1.
     - `r` appears at index 7, so `s[7]` is 3.
     - `a` appears at index 10, so `s[10]` is 4.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Trace: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`
   - Constructed String: `codeforces`
   - Explanation:
     - `c` appears at index 5, so `s[5]` is 1.
     - `o` appears at index 6, so `s[6]` is 1.
     - `d` appears at index 7, so `s[7]` is 1.
     - `e` appears at index 8, so `s[8]` is 1.
     - `f` appears at index 9, so `s[9]` is 1.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Trace: `[0]`
   - Constructed String: `a`
   - Explanation:
     - `a` appears at index 0, so `s[0]` is 0.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Trace: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
   - Constructed String: `aaaaaaab`
   - Explanation:
     - Each character `a` through `h` appears at increasing indices, so `s[i]` is `i`.

5. **Fifth Test Case:**
   - Trace: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - Constructed String: `dijsktra`
   - Explanation:
     - Each character appears at index 0, so `s[0]` is 0.

### Conclusion
The program correctly constructs the string based on the given trace. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
