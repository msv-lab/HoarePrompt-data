Reasoning:
1. The problem requires Bob to set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
2. The provided solution only considers two specific conditions:
   - If \( n = k \), it prints "YES", 1, and 1.
   - If \( n + 2 > k \times 2 \), it prints "YES", 2, and specific values for the prices.
3. These conditions do not cover all possible scenarios to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
4. For example, consider the test case where \( n = 255 \) and \( k = 8 \). The provided solution correctly handles this case by setting up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, respectively. However, the logic to achieve this is not fully implemented in the given code.
5. The solution should handle more general cases, such as when \( n \) is much larger than \( k \), and distribute the prices across multiple stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.

Given these points, the provided solution is incomplete and does not cover all necessary cases to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
