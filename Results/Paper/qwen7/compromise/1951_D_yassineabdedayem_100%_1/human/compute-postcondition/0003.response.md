Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to one iteration of the loop. For each iteration:

- If `n` equals `k`, it will print "YES\n1\n1".
- If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it will print "YES\n2" followed by two space-separated integers: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
- Otherwise, it will print "NO".

The exact content of each line depends on the values of `n` and `k` for each iteration, and there will be `t` such lines in total.
