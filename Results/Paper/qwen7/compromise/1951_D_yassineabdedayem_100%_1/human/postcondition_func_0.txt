The function processes a series of test cases, each containing three integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it checks the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \) and prints one of three possible outputs: "YES" followed by specific numbers or "NO". The function does not return any value but prints the results directly to the console.
