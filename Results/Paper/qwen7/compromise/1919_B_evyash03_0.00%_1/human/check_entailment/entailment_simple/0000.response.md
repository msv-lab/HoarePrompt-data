Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array represented by the string `s` into non-empty subarrays.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not properly calculate the penalty based on the splits of the array.
3. The `func_1` function counts the number of times the balance (sum of the subarray) becomes negative, which is not the same as calculating the minimum penalty.
4. The function also incorrectly adds 1 to `count` if `balance` is greater than 0 at the end, which does not align with the problem's requirements.
5. The program does not handle the actual calculation of penalties for the subarrays, which is required to determine the minimum possible penalty.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
