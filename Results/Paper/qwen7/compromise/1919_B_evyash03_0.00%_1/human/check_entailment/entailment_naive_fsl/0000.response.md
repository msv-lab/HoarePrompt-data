Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not account for the actual penalty calculation, which involves splitting the array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty based on the sum of elements in each subarray.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The expected output is `4`, but the program would incorrectly output `1`.

The program attempts to count the number of times the balance goes negative, which is not relevant to the penalty calculation. Instead, the program needs to find an optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. This involves more complex logic, such as dynamic programming or a greedy approach, to ensure the minimum penalty is achieved.
