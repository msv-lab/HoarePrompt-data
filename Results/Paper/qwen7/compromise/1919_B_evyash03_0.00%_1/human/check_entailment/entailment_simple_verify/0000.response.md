### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to split the array `a` (represented by the string `s`) into non-empty subarrays to minimize the total penalty.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program should output the minimum possible penalty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`), the length of the string (`length`), and the string itself (`expression`).
   - It then calls `func_1(expression, result_length)` with the string and its length.
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the string and counts the number of times the balance (difference between the number of '+' and '-') becomes negative.
   - It also checks if the balance is positive at the end and adds 1 if so.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` does not actually calculate the penalty or split the array into subarrays.
   - It simply counts how many times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end.
   - This logic does not align with the problem requirements, as it does not consider the actual penalty calculation or the optimal splitting of the array.

4. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     10
     --+++++++-
     ```
   - The expected output is `4`, but the program would incorrectly output `1`.
   - The program does not split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty; instead, it just counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the balance is positive at the end.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum possible penalty.
   - The original assessment is accurate in stating that the program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem requirements and does not implement the necessary logic to find the minimum possible penalty.
