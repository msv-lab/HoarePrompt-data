Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array represented by the string `s`.
2. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of times the balance (sum of the array elements) goes negative during iteration.
3. However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty. The function simply counts how many times the balance becomes negative, which does not necessarily lead to the optimal split.
4. The function does not account for the actual penalty calculation, which involves the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.
5. The function also does not handle the case where the balance is positive at the end of the iteration, which should be considered in the penalty calculation.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
