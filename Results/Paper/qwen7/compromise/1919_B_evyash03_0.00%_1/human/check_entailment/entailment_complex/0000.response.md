Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string (`length`) and the string itself (`expression`).
3. The `split('-')` method is used to split the string into parts based on the '-' character. However, this approach is incorrect because it only considers '-' as separators and ignores the sequence of '+' and '-' characters. This means it does not properly handle the required splitting of the array into contiguous segments of '+' and '-'.
4. The function `func_1` attempts to count the number of times the balance (sum of '+' and '-') becomes negative. However, this logic is flawed for calculating the minimum penalty. The function does not correctly compute the penalties based on the problem statement.
5. The function returns the count of times the balance becomes negative plus 1 if the balance is greater than 0. This does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the penalty.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
