Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not designed to determine the winner of the game based on the optimal strategy of both players. Instead, it appears to be checking for the presence of certain structural properties in the tree, which is not relevant to the game's outcome.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the game for each starting node and determine the winner based on the optimal moves of both players. The current implementation does not simulate the game rounds or consider the alternating moves between Ron and Hermione. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
