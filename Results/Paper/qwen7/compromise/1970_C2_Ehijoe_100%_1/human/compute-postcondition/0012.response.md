Output State: **`moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is still an empty list, `start` is an input integer, `empty` is still True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where each value is a list containing up to `n-1` integers representing the adjacent nodes to the corresponding key, `leaves` is a deque containing all the keys from `nodes` whose length is 1.**

Explanation: The code `moves = func_1(nodes, start)` calls the function `func_1` with `nodes` and `start` as arguments and assigns the result to the variable `moves`. The values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, `start`, `empty`, `nodes`, and `leaves` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `moves` variable now holds the result of the function call.
