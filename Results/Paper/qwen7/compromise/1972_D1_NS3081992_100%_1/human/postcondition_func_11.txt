The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of the same length as the maximum key in `d` initialized with zeros, an integer `da` which is a key in `d`, and a list `rank` initialized with zeros. It recursively processes the elements in `d[da]` to find the minimum value of a certain condition, updating the `processing` and `rank` lists accordingly. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 1000000001.
