### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Key Observation**: For an array to be beautiful, there must be at least one pair of adjacent elements that are equal and can be used to perform the operation. The goal is to find the smallest segment where this condition holds true and calculate the minimum removals needed to break this segment.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided code attempts to find the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements in the array.
   - It initializes `same` to count the length of the current segment of identical elements and `minn` to track the minimum segment length found.
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `same` and `minn` as necessary.
   - After processing the array, it prints `-1` if no segment was found (indicating the array is already non-beautiful) or the length of the smallest segment otherwise.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the entire array is uniform correctly by setting `minn` to infinity initially and checking if `minn` remains infinity after processing.
   - However, the logic to ensure the array is beautiful (as per the problem statement) is flawed. The code only checks for the presence of any segment of identical elements but does not ensure that the array is beautiful according to the given operation rules.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The code does not correctly identify whether the array is beautiful or not. It only checks for segments of identical elements without ensuring that these segments can be reduced to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The logic to determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the smallest segment is also flawed because it does not account for the specific operation rules.

6. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code states that the function processes multiple test cases and finds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`.
   - The logic in the annotated code is consistent with the original assessment. The function does not correctly determine whether the array is beautiful or not, and it does not account for the specific operation rules required to make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The original assessment accurately identifies the flaws in the code and the logic used to determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the smallest segment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
