Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be made of all identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then initializes variables to track the current sequence length (`same`), the number at the start of the current sequence (`num`), and the minimum sequence length found so far (`minn`).
   - The function uses a while loop to traverse the array, updating the sequence length and the minimum sequence length as needed.
   - After processing the array, it checks if a minimum sequence length was found and prints `-1` if not, otherwise it prints the minimum sequence length.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function correctly handles the constraints, including the maximum number of test cases and the maximum size of the arrays.
   - The function correctly identifies the minimum sequence length of consecutive identical elements, which is essential for determining the minimum number of removals required to make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The function prints `-1` when no sequence of consecutive identical elements is found, which is correct according to the problem statement.
   - The function prints the minimum sequence length when such a sequence is found, which also aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the function logic appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements without any logical errors or omissions.

Correctness: **True**
