Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Minimum Removals**: The program attempts to find the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`, which is not the correct approach. The problem requires identifying the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, not finding the minimum count of consecutive occurrences.

2. **Misinterpretation of "Beautiful" Array**: The program does not properly handle the condition to determine if an array is beautiful or not. The logic for checking if an array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements is missing.

3. **Output Handling**: The program prints the result directly without handling the output format correctly for multiple test cases. It should process each test case separately and print the result for each one.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
