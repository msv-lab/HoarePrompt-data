Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being increased by 1, while keeping the other variables and their relationships as described in the initial state.
