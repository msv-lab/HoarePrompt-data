Output State: **`same` is 1, `num` is `ar[3]`, `i` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, `ar` is a list of integers, and the first element of `ar` is not equal to `num`**.

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to be the value at index `i` in the list `ar`. Given that `i` is 3, `num` is now set to `ar[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
