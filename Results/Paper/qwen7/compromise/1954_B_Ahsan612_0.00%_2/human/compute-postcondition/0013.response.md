Output State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to `ar[2]`, `i` is 2, and `ar[2]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`, where `i` is 2. Since `ar[2]` was already equal to `num` (as per the initial state), the value of `num` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial values.
