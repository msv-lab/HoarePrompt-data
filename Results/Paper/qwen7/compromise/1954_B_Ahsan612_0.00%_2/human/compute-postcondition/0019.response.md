Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (initially infinity) and `same` (which is 2), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 2, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
