Output State: **`same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The line `minn = inf` sets the variable `minn` to infinity (`inf`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
