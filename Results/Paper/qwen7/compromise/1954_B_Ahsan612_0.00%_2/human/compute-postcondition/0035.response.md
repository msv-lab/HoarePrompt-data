Output State: `minn` is the minimum value encountered for `same` during the entire loop execution, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1 (reset after the last comparison), `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was compared, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` remains the minimum value found for `same`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `minn` will hold the smallest value of `same` which represents the shortest sequence of consecutive identical numbers in the list `ar`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list.
