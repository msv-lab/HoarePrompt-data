Output State: **`same` is 2, `num` is `ar[i]`, `i` is 5, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num` to be equal to `ar[i]`. Since `i` is 5, `ar[i]` is the same as `ar[5]`, which was previously equal to `num`. Therefore, `num` is now equal to `ar[5]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
