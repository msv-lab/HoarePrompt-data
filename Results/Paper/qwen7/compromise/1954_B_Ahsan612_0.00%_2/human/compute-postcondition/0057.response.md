Output State: **`same` is 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `i` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to be equal to `ar[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
