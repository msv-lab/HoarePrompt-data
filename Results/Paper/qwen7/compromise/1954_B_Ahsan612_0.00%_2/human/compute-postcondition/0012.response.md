Output State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was set to 1. After executing the code, `i` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
