Output State: `minn` contains the smallest number of consecutive occurrences of any number in the entire list `ar` across all iterations of the loop. `same` holds the count of consecutive occurrences of the current number being processed. `num` is the last number in the list `ar` that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences. `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, indicating the end of the list. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `n` is an input integer representing the length of the list `ar`. After all iterations, `minn` is the minimum value among all `same` values encountered during the loop's execution, which represents the smallest group of consecutive identical elements in the list `ar`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `minn` will hold the size of the smallest group of consecutive identical numbers in the array `ar`, considering all test cases.
