Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, `same` is updated to be 1 if a different number is encountered or remains the same if the same number continues consecutively, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was processed, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and the input for the next iteration must be a positive integer.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. The other variables (`same`, `num`, `i`, `t`, `n`) remain unchanged. The length of the list `ar` is stored in `i`. The value of `num` is set to the last element of the list `ar`. The variable `same` is updated based on whether the current number is the same as the previous one, but its exact value depends on the input. The variable `n` is an input integer from the user, and the precondition that `n` must be a positive integer remains valid.
