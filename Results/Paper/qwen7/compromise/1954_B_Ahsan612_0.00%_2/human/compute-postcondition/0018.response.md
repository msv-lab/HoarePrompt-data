Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `minn` is the minimum of `minn` (initially infinity) and `same` (which is 1).
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `num` is the first element of the list `ar`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `minn` remains the minimum of `minn` (initially infinity) and `same` (which is 1).

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop head checks if `i < len(ar)`.
   - Currently, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Given that `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3, and `i < len(ar)` must still hold true. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Increment `i` to 3.
   - Ensure that `i < len(ar)` holds true.

Since no other states are directly involved in the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (initially infinity) and `same` (which is 1), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `i` is 3, and `minn` remains the minimum of `minn` (initially infinity) and `same` (which is 1)**.
