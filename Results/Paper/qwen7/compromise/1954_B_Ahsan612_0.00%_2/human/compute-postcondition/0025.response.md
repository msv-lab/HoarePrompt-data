Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is 2, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The initial state is defined such that `minn` is the minimum of `minn` (initially infinity) and `same` (which is 2), and if `ar[i]` equals `num`, then `same` is 2. Otherwise, `minn` is 1, `same` is 1, and `i` is updated to 4. The code snippet `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Since `i` was previously set to 4, after the increment, `i` becomes 5. The values of `minn` and `same` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `minn` is 1, `same` is 2, `i` is 5. However, since the initial state description already sets `i` to 4 when the condition is not met, the correct output state should reflect that `i` remains 4 after the increment operation.
