Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 1; `minn` is 2 or `same`, depending on the value of `same`; `num` is now `ar[i]`, `i` is either 6 or 7, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum between its current value (which is 2) and the value of `same`. Since `same` is either 3 or 1, `minn` will be updated to 1 if `same` is 1, and will remain 2 if `same` is 3. The other variables (`num`, `i`, `t`, `n`) are not affected by this line of code.
