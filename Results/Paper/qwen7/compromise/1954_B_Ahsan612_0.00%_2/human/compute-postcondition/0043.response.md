Postcondition: **`minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`. `same` is updated to be 1 if a different number is encountered or remains the same if the same number continues consecutively. `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was processed. `i` is equal to `len(ar)`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that regardless of which branch of the if-else statement is executed, the final state of the variables adheres to the described conditions.
