Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `same` is either 3 or 1.
   - `num` is either `ar[0]` when `same` is 3 or `ar[i]` when `same` is 1.
   - `i` is either 5 or 6.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `minn` is 2.

3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Given that `i` is either 5 or 6, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(ar)` for the loop to continue. Therefore, `len(ar)` must be greater than 6 (since `i` is at most 6).

Since no other variables in the loop head (`i`) directly affect the loop condition, we do not need to adjust any other states.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `num` is either `ar[0]` when `same` is 3 or `ar[i]` when `same` is 1, `i` is either 5 or 6, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is 2, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 6**
