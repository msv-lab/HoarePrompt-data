Output State: **`minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`, `same` is updated to be 1 if a different number is encountered or remains the same if the same number continues consecutively, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was processed, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and the input for the next iteration must be a positive integer, `n` is the integer input from the user.**

This means that the variable `n` has been assigned the value of the integer input from the user, while all other variables remain in their previous states.
