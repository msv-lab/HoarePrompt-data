Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is 2, `i` is less than `len(ar) - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially less than `len(ar)` and `len(ar)` is greater than 4, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` is now less than `len(ar) - 1`. The values of `minn` and `same` remain unchanged.
