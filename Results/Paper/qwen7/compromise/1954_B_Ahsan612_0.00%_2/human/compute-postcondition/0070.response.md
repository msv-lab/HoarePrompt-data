The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was either 4 when `same` is 3 or 5 when `same` is 1. After incrementing, `i` will be 5 when `same` is 3 and 6 when `same` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `num` is either `ar[0]` when `same` is 3 or `ar[i]` when `same` is 1, `i` is either 5 or 6, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is 2.**
