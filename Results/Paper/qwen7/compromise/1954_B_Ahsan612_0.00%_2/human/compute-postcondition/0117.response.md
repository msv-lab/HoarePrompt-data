Output State: **`same` is either 4 or 2, `num` is `ar[i]`, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The variable `same` is incremented by 1. Given that `same` was initially either 3 or 1, after incrementing by 1, `same` will now be either 4 (if it was initially 3) or 2 (if it was initially 1). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
