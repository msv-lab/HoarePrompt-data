Output State: **`l` must be less than `r`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is 1, `r` is decreased by 1**.

The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables (`l`, `st`, and `end`) remain unchanged. The condition `l` must be less than `r` is still valid since only `r` was modified.
