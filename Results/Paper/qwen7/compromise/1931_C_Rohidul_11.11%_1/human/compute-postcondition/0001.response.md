Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input which must be a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4 (inclusive) and converts it to an integer type. After executing this line, the variable `n` holds the value of the input provided, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the only updated information is that `n` is now an integer between 1 and 10^4.
