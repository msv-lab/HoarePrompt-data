Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Analyze each part of the loop condition**:
   - `l < r`: This checks if the left index `l` is less than the right index `r`.
   - `a[l] == a[l + 1]`: This checks if the element at index `l` in the list `a` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - `st` is 0.
   - `end` is 0.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions in the loop head must be satisfied.
   - `l < r`: Since `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, this condition will be satisfied as long as `n > 1`.
   - `a[l] == a[l + 1]`: For this to be true, the first element `a[0]` must be equal to the second element `a[1]`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variables in the loop head that need adjustment are `a[0]` and `a[1]` to ensure they are equal.
   - Additionally, `n` must be greater than 1 to satisfy the condition `l < r`.

Therefore, the modified state before the loop should include the following adjustments:
- `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0**
