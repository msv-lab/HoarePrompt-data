Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is 0, `st` is `n - 3`, `end` is `end + 3`, `ans` is `-1`, the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = r - l - 1` calculates the value of `ans` based on the current values of `r` and `l`. Given `r` is 0 and `l` is `n - 2`, the calculation is `0 - (n - 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `-1`. The values of `st`, `end`, and the condition that the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a` remain unchanged.
