Output State: `l` is equal to `r`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, `end` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`. Each iteration increments `l` and increases `st` by 1. This process continues until `l` is no longer less than `r` or the elements at `l` and `l + 1` are not equal. Therefore, when the loop finishes, `l` will be equal to `r`, indicating that there are no more consecutive equal elements at the start of the list, and `st` will hold the count of these consecutive equal elements.
