Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `l` is equal to `n - 1`, `r` is greater than `l`, `st` is `n - 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times and `l` is now 4, it implies that there were at least 3 consecutive elements in the array that were equal. Therefore, the loop will continue to increment `l` until it reaches `n - 1`, making sure that `l` is no longer less than `r`. Since `r` was initially `n - 1` and hasn't been changed within the loop, `r` remains `n - 1`. The variable `st` keeps track of how many times the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` was met, so after `n - 1` increments of `l`, `st` will be `n - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
    r -= 1
    end += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `l` is equal to `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is `n + 1`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is `n + 2`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
