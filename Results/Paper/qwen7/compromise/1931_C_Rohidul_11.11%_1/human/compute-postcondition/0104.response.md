Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 4`, `st` is `n - 3`, `end` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Given that `r` was initially `n - 3`, after the operation, `r` becomes `n - 4`. All other variables (`l`, `st`, and `end`) remain unchanged. The state of `end` being "increased by 1" from its initial state is preserved.
