Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is `n - 5`, `st` is `n - 3`, `end` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `end += 1` increments the value of `end` by 1. The other variables (`l`, `r`, `st`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `l` is still `n - 2`, `r` is still `n - 5`, `st` is still `n - 3`, and `end` is increased by 1.
