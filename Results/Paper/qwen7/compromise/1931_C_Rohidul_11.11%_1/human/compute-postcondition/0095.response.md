Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `l` is 3
   - `r` must be greater than 2
   - `st` is 1 (This variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `l` and `r`.

4. **Check the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute again, both conditions `l < r` and `a[l] == a[l + 1]` must be true.
   - Currently, `l` is 3. Therefore, for `l < r` to be true, `r` must be greater than 3.
   - Additionally, `a[l]` is `a[3]`, and `a[l + 1]` is `a[4]`. The loop continues as long as `a[3] == a[4]`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `l` is fixed at 3, `r` must be greater than 3 to satisfy `l < r`.
   - There is no information about the values of `a[3]` and `a[4]`, but for the loop to continue, `a[3]` must be equal to `a[4]`.

### Final Answer

The variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust those. To ensure the loop executes again, `r` must be greater than 3, and `a[3]` must be equal to `a[4]`.

State: **`l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 3, and `a[3]` must be equal to `a[4]`**
