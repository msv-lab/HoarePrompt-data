Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It then calculates a value \( ans \) based on certain conditions involving the first and last elements of the list and the repetition of adjacent elements. Finally, it prints the maximum of 0 and \( ans \).**
