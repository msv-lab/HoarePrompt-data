Output State: **`l` is equal to `n - 1`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is `n - 1`, `end` is `2 * n - 2`, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `r - l`. Given the initial state, both `l` and `r` are equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, `ans` is calculated as `(n - 1) - (n - 1)`, which results in 0. All other variables (`st`, `end`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
