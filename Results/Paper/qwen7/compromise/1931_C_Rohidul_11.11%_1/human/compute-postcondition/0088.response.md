Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, and `ans` is either `n - 3` or `0` depending on whether the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `st, end = 0, 0` updates the values of `st` and `end` to 0. The values of `l`, `r`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `l` is still 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is now 0, `end` is now 0, and `ans` is still either `n - 3` or `0` depending on the condition specified.
