Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
2. **Determine which states need adjustment**: We need to ensure that both parts of the loop condition are true for the next iteration.
   - The first part of the condition is `r > l`.
   - The second part of the condition is `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

3. **Analyze the given states**:
   - `l` must be less than `r`.
   - `st` is equal to the number of consecutive equal elements at the start of the list (this state does not affect the loop condition directly).
   - `end` is 2.
   - `r` is decreased by 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `r` is decreased by 1 at the end of the iteration, the new value of `r` will be `r - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `r - 1` must still be greater than `l`, so `r` must be greater than `l + 1`.
   - Additionally, `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` for the second part of the condition to hold.

Given these conditions, we need to ensure:
- `r - 1` is greater than `l`.
- `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`.

Since `r` is decreased by 1, the new value of `r` is `r - 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `r - 1 > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

So, the adjusted states are:
- `l` must be less than `r - 1`.
- `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]`.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`l` is less than `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`**
