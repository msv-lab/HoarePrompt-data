Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `st` is 0, `end` is 0**.

The code assigns the value `0` to both `st` and `end`. The values of `l`, `r`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
