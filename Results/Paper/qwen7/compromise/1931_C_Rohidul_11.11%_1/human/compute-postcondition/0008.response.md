Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `l` is 1
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`
   - `st` is 1
   - `end` is 0

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition involves two variables: `l` and `r`.
   - Additionally, the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]` depends on the values of `a[l]` and `a[l + 1]`.

4. **Check the Current Values**:
   - `l` is 1
   - `r` is `n - 1`
   - Since `n` must be greater than 1, `r` is a valid value (assuming `n > 1`).
   - `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, but this is not directly affecting the loop condition since `l` is 1.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `r` and `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`.
   - Currently, `l` is 1, so `a[l]` is `a[1]`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute again, `a[2]` must be equal to `a[1]` (since `l + 1` would be 2).

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `a[2]` is equal to `a[1]` to satisfy the condition `a[l] == a[l + 1]`.
   - We also need to ensure that `l` is still less than `r`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a[2]` must be equal to `a[1]`
- `l` must be less than `r`

Since `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`, and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` will always be less than `r` as long as `a[2]` is equal to `a[1]`.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` is equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` is equal to `a[2]`, `st` is 1, `end` is 0**
