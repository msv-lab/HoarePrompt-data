Output State: **`l` is `n - 2`, `r` is 0, `st` is `n - 3`, `end` is increased by 3.**

Explanation: Given that the loop continues to decrement `r` and increment `end` as long as `r` is greater than `l` and the adjacent elements `a[r]` and `a[r - 1]` are equal, and considering that the loop has already executed 3 times, it implies there were at least 3 consecutive identical elements at the start of the list. After these 3 iterations, `r` has been decremented by 3 from its initial value of `n - 1`. Since the loop will continue to decrement `r` and increment `end` until `r` is no longer greater than `l`, and given the initial conditions, `r` will reach 0 before `l` does. Therefore, `l` remains at `n - 2` and `r` is 0. The variable `st` remains unchanged at `n - 3`, and `end` is increased by 3 due to the 3 iterations of the loop.
