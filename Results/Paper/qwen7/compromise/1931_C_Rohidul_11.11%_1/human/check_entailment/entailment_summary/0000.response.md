Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying segments of the array where elements are the same and calculating the minimum cost to make all elements equal. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Initial Conditions Check**: The program checks if the first and last elements are the same and calculates `ans` accordingly. This approach is incomplete because it doesn't account for all possible scenarios where making all elements equal might require fewer operations.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program only considers the first and last elements and doesn't handle cases where the array has repeating segments correctly. For instance, if the array is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`, the program might not correctly identify the optimal segment to change.

3. **Calculation of `ans`**: The calculation of `ans` is based on the positions of the first and last differing elements (`l` and `r`). This approach might not always yield the minimum cost. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]` and we choose `i=2`, `j=4`, `x=8`, the cost would be `(j-i+1) = 3` burles, but the program doesn't consider this type of operation.

4. **Handling Repetitive Segments**: The program increments `st` and `end` to count repetitive segments at the beginning and end of the array. However, these counts are not used effectively to calculate the minimum cost.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **False**
