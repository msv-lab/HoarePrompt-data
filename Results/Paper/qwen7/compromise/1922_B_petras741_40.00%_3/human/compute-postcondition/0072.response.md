Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `q` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `q[q[w[j]]]'s value is incremented by 1 for each j from 0 to n**.

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Since `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, and `q` is a list of `n+1` elements initialized to 0, the value at `q[w[j]]` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `n`) will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `w[j]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
