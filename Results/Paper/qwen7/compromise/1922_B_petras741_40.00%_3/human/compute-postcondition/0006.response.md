Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `q` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `q`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `w` remain unchanged from their initial states.
