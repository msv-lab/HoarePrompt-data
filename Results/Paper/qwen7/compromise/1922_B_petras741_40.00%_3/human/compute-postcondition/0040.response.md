Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`, `eta` must have at least one element, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `rho` is incremented by `q[eta[j]]`. The value of `res` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. The conditions for `eta` and `eta_ln` remain the same.
