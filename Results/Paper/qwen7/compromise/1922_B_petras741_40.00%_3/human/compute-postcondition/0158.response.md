Output State: `eta` is a list containing all indices from `0` to `n` where the corresponding elements in `q` were greater than 0, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and each element in the list `q` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding index in the list `w`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations (from `j = 0` to `j = n`), `eta` will contain all indices `j` for which `q[j]` was initially greater than 0. The loop increments `j` from `n-1` down to `0`, checking if `q[j]` is greater than 0, and if so, appends `j` to `eta`. Once `j` reaches `n + 1`, the loop terminates.
