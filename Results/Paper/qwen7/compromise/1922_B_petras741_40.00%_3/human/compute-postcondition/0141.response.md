Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1 and its new value is 2.
   - `q[w[j]]` is also incremented by 1 and its new value is 2.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < n`. Since `j` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
