Output State: **`q` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` from the previous iteration and the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, the new value of `j` is added to `eta`. The lists `q` and the state of `j` are updated accordingly.
