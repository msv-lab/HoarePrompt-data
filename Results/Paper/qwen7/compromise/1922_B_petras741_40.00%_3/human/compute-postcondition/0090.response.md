Output State: **`q` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` from the previous iteration and the new value of `j`, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `eta` has the new value of `j` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the current value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, the new value of `j` is added to `eta`. All other variables remain unchanged.
