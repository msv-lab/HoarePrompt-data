Based on the initial state provided:

- `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`
- `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, which is the number of unique integers from `w` that have a count greater than 0 in `q`. The current value of `eta_ln` is 1.

We need to evaluate the expression `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6` where `n` is `eta_ln`.

Given that `eta_ln` is currently 1, we substitute `n` with 1:

\[ n = 1 \]

So the expression becomes:

\[ 1 * (1 - 1) * (1 - 2) // 6 \]

Simplifying this:

\[ 1 * 0 * (-1) // 6 \]
\[ 0 // 6 \]
\[ 0 \]

Therefore, the print statement will output 0.

Output: **0**
