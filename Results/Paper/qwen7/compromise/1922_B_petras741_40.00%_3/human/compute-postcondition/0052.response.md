Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[1001]] * (q[eta[1001]] - 1) * (q[eta[1001]] - 2) // 6` to its current value.
   - `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[1001]]` to its current value.
   - The loop condition is `for j in range(1, eta_ln)`.

2. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `eta_ln - 1`.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < eta_ln`.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop runs based on the value of `j`, and `j` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, the new value of `j` at the start of the next iteration will be `j + 1`.
   - The values of `res` and `rho` remain unchanged unless they are updated within the loop body, but since no such updates are mentioned, we assume they stay the same.

5. **New State:**
   - `j` will be `2` (since it started from `1` and will increment by `1`).
   - `eta_ln` remains unchanged.
   - `res` and `rho` remain as they were updated in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`res` is updated by adding `q[eta[1001]] * (q[eta[1001]] - 1) * (q[eta[1001]] - 2) // 6` to its current value, `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[1001]]` to its current value, `j` is 2, and `eta_ln` must be greater than 2.**
