Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case includes a count of test cases (`t`), the size of the list (`n`), and a list of non-negative integers (`a`). The function processes each test case according to the given constraints and returns a result for each one.
