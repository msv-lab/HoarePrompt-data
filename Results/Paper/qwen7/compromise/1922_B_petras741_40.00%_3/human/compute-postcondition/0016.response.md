Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` is not explicitly given, but it is used in the range function.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`. 

4. **Initial values**:
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is not specified, but it must be a non-negative integer for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` starts at `n-1`, the loop will run once if `n` is at least 1.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - `j` should be initialized to `n-1` for the first iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `j`.

**Final State**:
State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 1**
