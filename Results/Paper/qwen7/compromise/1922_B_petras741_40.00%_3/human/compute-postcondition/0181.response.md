Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `eta_ln`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `eta_ln`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is greater than 1001.
   - `eta_ln` must be greater than 1001.
   - `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1)`.
   - If `j` is greater than 1000, the loop breaks.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `eta_ln`.
   - Since `j` is currently greater than 1001, it needs to be set to 1002 for the next iteration to start.
   - `eta_ln` remains unchanged as it must still be greater than 1001.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` should be set to 1002.
   - `eta_ln` remains the same and must still be greater than 1001.
   - `rho` does not need to be adjusted as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `j` is 1002, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1001**
