Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, and the value of t is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = {}
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
                if j > 1000:
                    break
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n + 1`, `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`, and `res` accumulates the contributions from each iteration of the loop, where each contribution is the sum of two terms: `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` and `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `rho` accumulates the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for each `j` from 1 to 1000. If `n` is less than 3, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `w` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` remains the same, `i` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, which is the number of unique integers from `w` that have a count greater than 0 in `q`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, `rho` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `rho` is set to the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` in `eta`, and additional calculations involving `res` are performed based on the values in `eta` where `j > 0` and `j` does not exceed 1000. If `n` is less than 3, `t` remains the same, `i` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `j` is greater than `eta_ln`, `res` is increased by the sum of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each iteration from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]` for each iteration from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `n` is less than 3, `t` remains unchanged, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is an integer input by the user, with `w` being a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
