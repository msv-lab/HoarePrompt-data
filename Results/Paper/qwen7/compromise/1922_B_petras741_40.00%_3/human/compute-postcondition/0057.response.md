Postcondition: `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[1001]] * (q[eta[1001]] - 1) * (q[eta[1001]] - 2) // 6` to its current value, `rho` is updated by adding `q[eta[1001]] + q[eta[2]]` to its current value, `j` is 2, and `res` is further updated by adding `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * (q[eta[1001]] + q[eta[2]])` to its current value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
