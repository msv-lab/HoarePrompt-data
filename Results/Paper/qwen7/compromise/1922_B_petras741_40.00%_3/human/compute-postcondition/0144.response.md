Output State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is equal to `n-1`, and each element in the list `q` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding index in the list `w`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` is set to `n-1`, and the list `q` has had each of its elements incremented by 1 for every time that index appeared in the list `w`. The list `eta` remains unchanged and is still an empty list.
