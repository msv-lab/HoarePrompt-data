Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n):`. The objects involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `j` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is initialized to 0, the loop will start with `j = 0`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be less than `n`, so `j` should be 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. However, since `n` is already given as an input integer greater than or equal to 3, this condition is already satisfied.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - We need to ensure that `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
