Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `rho` is equal to the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`, and `res` is `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, eta_ln):
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
    rho += q[eta[j]]
    if j > 1000:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is greater than 1000, `eta_ln` must be greater than `j`, `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`. If `j` is not greater than 1000, the conditions for `eta_ln` and `res` remain as they were before the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is greater than 1001, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1001, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1)`. If `j` is greater than 1000, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is greater than 1002, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1001, `rho` and `res` are increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. If `j` is greater than 1000, `rho` and `res` are further increased by the same amount and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
