Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `n-1`; each element in `q` at index corresponding to elements in `w` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of that element in `w`, resulting in a count of how many times each element appears in `w`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `j` will have the value `n-1` since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The list `q` will contain counts of each integer found in the list `w`, where `q[k]` represents the number of times the integer `k` appears in `w`.
