Output State: **`eta` is [j], `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and each element in the list `q` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding index in the list `w`. The current value of `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `j` was previously equal to `n - 1`, the new list `eta` now contains `[j]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
