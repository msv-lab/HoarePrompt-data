Based on the initial state provided:

- `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, and it is explicitly stated that `eta_ln` is equal to 1.
- `j` is `n + 1`, and `n` is greater than 0.
- `rho` is equal to the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`. Since `eta[0]` does not exist (because `eta_ln` is 1, meaning `eta` has no elements), this part of the state is not directly relevant to the calculation in the `print` statement.
- The expression being printed is `n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6`.

Given that `eta_ln` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0, let's consider the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 1. However, if `n` were 1, then `(n - 1)` and `(n - 2)` would both be 0, making the entire expression evaluate to 0. Since `n` must be greater than 0 and the expression involves division by 6, `n` cannot be 1 because it would lead to a division by zero error or an incorrect result.

Let's assume the smallest valid value for `n` is 2 (since `n = 1` leads to invalid operations):

- If `n = 2`, then the expression becomes `2 * (2 - 1) * (2 - 2) // 6 = 2 * 1 * 0 // 6 = 0`.

However, since `n` is greater than 0 and the expression involves `n - 2`, the smallest valid `n` that avoids negative indices or zero in the denominator is `n = 3`.

- If `n = 3`, then the expression becomes `3 * (3 - 1) * (3 - 2) // 6 = 3 * 2 * 1 // 6 = 6 // 6 = 1`.

Therefore, the expression evaluates to 1 when `n = 3`.

Output: **1**
