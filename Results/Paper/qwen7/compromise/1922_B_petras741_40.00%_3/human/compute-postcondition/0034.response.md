Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `eta` is an empty list: `eta = []`
   - `j` is `n + 1`: Since `eta` is empty, `eta[0]` does not exist, but the expression `n + 1` is used to assign a value to `j`. Therefore, `j = n + 1`.
   - `eta_ln` is 1: This is a standalone value, not dependent on any other variables.
   - `rho` is `q[eta[0]]`: Since `eta` is an empty list, `eta[0]` does not exist, so this expression cannot be evaluated directly. However, it implies that `rho` would be `q[None]` if we were to consider it in a context where `eta[0]` could be accessed.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
   ```

Given the initial state, the only variable involved in the print statement is `n`. The values of `eta`, `j`, `eta_ln`, and `rho` do not affect the print statement itself.

Since the print statement involves `n`, and no specific value for `n` is provided, we can only express the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6**
