Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the range `range(n + 1)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j = 0` (the default starting value for `range`), `j` should be set to 0 before the loop starts.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `j` must be within the range `[0, n]`.

4. **Adjust the state of `n`**: The problem states that `n` must be greater than 0. This ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

5. **No changes needed for other variables**: The variables `t`, `i`, `w`, `q`, and `eta` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` being set to 0 and `n` being greater than 0.

**Final State:**
State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
