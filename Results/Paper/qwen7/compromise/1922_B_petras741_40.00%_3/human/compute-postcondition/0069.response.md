Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `q` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `q`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `w`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
