Output State: `eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n + 1`. 

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will increment from `n-1` to `n`, and then to `n+1`. The condition `if q[j] > 0:` will never be true because `j` will be out of the bounds of the list `q` (assuming `q` has a length of `n`). Therefore, `eta` will remain an empty list throughout all iterations of the loop.
