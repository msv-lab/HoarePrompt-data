Output State: **`j` is 0; `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 0, `w[j]` refers to `w[0]`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `w`, we cannot specify the exact value of `q[w[j]]`. However, we know that `j` remains 0 and `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1.
