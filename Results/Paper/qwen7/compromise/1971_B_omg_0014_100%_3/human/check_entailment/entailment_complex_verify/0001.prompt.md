You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)

                print(b)
        
    #State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration based on whether the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If 'YES' is printed, the sorted version of `s` (in ascending order) or its reverse (in descending order) will also be printed, depending on which is equal to the original string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If `s` has only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by either the sorted version of `s` in ascending order or its reverse in descending order, depending on which matches the original string `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Checking if Rearrangement is Possible:**
   - The program checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting `s` into a set `a`.
   - If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are identical, and thus, no rearrangement can produce a different string. In this case, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES' indicating that a different rearrangement is possible.

3. **Generating Different Rearrangements:**
   - The program generates two different rearrangements of the string `s`:
     - `b` is the sorted version of `s` (in ascending order).
     - `c` is the sorted version of `s` but in descending order.
   - It then checks if `b` is equal to `s`. If `b` is not equal to `s`, it prints `c` (which is a different rearrangement).
   - If `b` is equal to `s`, it prints `c` (which is still a different rearrangement since `b` and `c` are reversed versions of each other).

### Testing the Program with Examples:

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

- **Test Case: "codeforces"**
  - Set `a` has more than one element, so it prints 'YES'.
  - `b` (sorted) = 'ccdefoorst', `c` (reverse sorted) = 'tsorfedc'. Since `b` is not equal to `s`, it prints `c` (valid rearrangement).

- **Test Case: "aaaaa"**
  - Set `a` has only one element, so it prints 'NO'.

- **Test Case: "co"**
  - Set `a` has more than one element, so it prints 'YES'.
  - `b` (sorted) = 'co', `c` (reverse sorted) = 'oc'. Since `b` is equal to `s`, it prints `c` (valid rearrangement).

- **Test Case: "d"**
  - Set `a` has only one element, so it prints 'NO'.

- **Test Case: "nutdealer"**
  - Set `a` has more than one element, so it prints 'YES'.
  - `b` (sorted) = 'aeelnorttu', `c` (reverse sorted) = 'uttornelne'. Since `b` is not equal to `s`, it prints `c` (valid rearrangement).

- **Test Case: "mwistht"**
  - Set `a` has more than one element, so it prints 'YES'.
  - `b` (sorted) = 'ehimrstw', `c` (reverse sorted) = 'wtrshim'. Since `b` is not equal to `s`, it prints `c` (valid rearrangement).

- **Test Case: "hhhhhhhhhh"**
  - Set `a` has only one element, so it prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the test cases provided in the problem statement. It identifies when a rearrangement is not possible and provides a valid rearrangement when possible.
