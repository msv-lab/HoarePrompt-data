Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`.
- `i` is `0`.
- `n` must be greater than `0`.
- `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`.
- The current value of `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`.

The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of the variable `i`.

Output: **0**
