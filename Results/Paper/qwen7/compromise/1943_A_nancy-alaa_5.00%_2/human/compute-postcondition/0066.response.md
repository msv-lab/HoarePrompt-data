Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is `n-2`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and if `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i] != 1`, no changes occur to the variables.
