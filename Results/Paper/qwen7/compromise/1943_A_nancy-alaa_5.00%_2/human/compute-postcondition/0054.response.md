Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `False`.
- `i` is `n-2`.
- `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input.
- `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`.
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`.
- `i` must be less than `n`.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is `n-2`.

Output: **n-2**
