Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `i < n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `first` is True
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces
   - `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`
   - If `i` is such that `mpp[i]` equals 1, `first` will be set to True. Otherwise, `first` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1 (assuming `i` starts from 0).
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.
   - The value of `first` remains unchanged unless `mpp[1]` equals 1, but since we don't have information about the contents of `arr` or `mpp`, we cannot determine if `first` will change. Therefore, we assume it remains as it is.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `first` is True (unchanged)
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`first` is True, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
