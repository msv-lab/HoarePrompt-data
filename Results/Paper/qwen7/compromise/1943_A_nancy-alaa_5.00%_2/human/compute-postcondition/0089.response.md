Postcondition: `first` is False, `i` is `i - 1`, `n` remains the same, and `mpp[i]` does not equal 1. If `i` is not a key in `mpp` or `mpp[i]` is not equal to 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1, `first` becomes True, `i` is decremented by 1, and we still break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
