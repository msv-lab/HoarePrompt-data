Output State: **`first` is True, `i` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The variable `first` is explicitly set to `True`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial postcondition. The other conditions and postconditions remain unchanged, meaning if `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. However, since `first` is now `True`, the condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` being true will trigger the break, but this is not reflected in the output state as the question asks for the state after the code execution without detailing the actions inside loops or if statements.
