Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element to an integer. The resulting list of integers is stored in `arr`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was only used to indicate that an integer was initially inputted, but its specific value is not known after this operation.
