Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `first` remains `False`.
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop is if `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is `True`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-2`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by `1`, making it `n-1`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - If `i` reaches `n-1`, the loop will terminate.

5. **States to Adjust:**
   - `i` will change from `n-2` to `n-1`.
   - `first` remains `False` as per the postcondition.
   - `arr` and `mpp` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` changes from `n-2` to `n-1`.
- `first` remains `False`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`first` remains False, `i` is n-1, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`**
