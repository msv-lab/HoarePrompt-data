Output State: **`first` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement causes the loop or conditional block it is inside to terminate, but it does not affect the values of `first`, `arr`, or `mpp`. It only affects the control flow by exiting the loop or conditional block. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state.
