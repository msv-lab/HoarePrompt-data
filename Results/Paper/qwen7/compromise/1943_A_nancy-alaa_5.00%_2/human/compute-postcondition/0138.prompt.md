Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `first` remains False, `i` is n-2, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`, and `n` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if i not in mpp.keys():
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
        print(i)
        break
    if mpp[i] == 1:
        first = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `first` remains False, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`. If the current value of `i` is a key in `mpp` with a count of 1 and `first` is True, then the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs if the condition `mpp[i] == 1 and first` is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `first` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers based on the new input, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the count of each element in `arr`. If `i` is not a key in `mpp` or if `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is true, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `first` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `mpp[i]` equals 1 and `first` is false, `first` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
