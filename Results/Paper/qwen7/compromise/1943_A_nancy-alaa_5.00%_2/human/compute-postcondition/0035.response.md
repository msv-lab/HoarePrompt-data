Based on the initial state provided:

- `first` is `True`
- `i` is `2`
- `n` must be greater than `1`

The code snippet to be executed is:

```python
print(i)
```

Here, `i` is explicitly defined as `2`.

Therefore, the output of the `print(i)` statement will be the value of `i`, which is `2`.

Output: **2**
