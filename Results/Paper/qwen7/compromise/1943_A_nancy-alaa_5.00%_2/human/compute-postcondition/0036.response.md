Output State: **`first` is True, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `first` and `i`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it is inside. Since no such loop or if statement is explicitly mentioned in the code, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains valid but is not affected by the code execution.
