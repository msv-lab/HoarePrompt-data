Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variables here are `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `first` is True
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` is the input integer
   - `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces
   - `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. This value is the number of times the loop will run.
   - Since the loop has just completed one iteration, the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `first` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - The variable `i` will be updated to `n-2` because `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop will run one more time.
   - The variable `n` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
   - The variable `arr` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.
   - The variable `mpp` remains the same as it is not part of the loop head.

5. **Final State**:
   - The loop will execute one more time, so the remaining number of iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.
   - `i` will be `n-2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`first` is True, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is the input integer, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each element in `arr`**.
