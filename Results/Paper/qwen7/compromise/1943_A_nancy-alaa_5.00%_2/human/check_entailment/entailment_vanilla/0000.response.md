Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Preparation**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in `arr`.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The program iterates through numbers from `0` to `n-1` to determine the MEX.
   - If a number `i` is not present in the array (`i not in mpp.keys()`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If the number `i` appears exactly once and `first` is already `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - If the number `i` appears exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Misunderstanding of Player Moves**:
   - The program incorrectly simulates the game logic. According to the problem, Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, and then delete it from `a`. Bob can only pick and delete an element from `a`.
   - The current implementation does not simulate these moves correctly. It just checks for the presence of elements in the array and prints the first missing number, which does not reflect the actual game dynamics.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.
   - The current approach does not consider the sequence of moves and the impact of each player's actions on the final state of `c`.

3. **Output**:
   - The output of the program is not consistent with the expected behavior of the game. It simply prints the first missing number without considering the optimal play of both players.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
