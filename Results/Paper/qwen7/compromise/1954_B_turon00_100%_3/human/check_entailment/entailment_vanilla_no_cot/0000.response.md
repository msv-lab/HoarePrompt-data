Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed and does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Removals**:
   - The program counts consecutive elements that are the same and uses this count to determine the minimum removals needed. However, this approach does not account for the specific operation allowed in the problem statement, which involves removing an element `a_i` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Misunderstanding the Operation**:
   - The program does not simulate the operation of replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` when `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`. Instead, it simply counts consecutive identical elements, which does not reflect the actual operation required to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as arrays where the operation cannot be performed (e.g., `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`), and it incorrectly outputs `-1` for some cases where it should output the correct number of removals.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the operation described and track the positions where the operation can be applied. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Track positions where the operation can be applied
        operations = []
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if a[i-1] == a[i+1]:
                operations.append(i)
        
        # If there are no operations possible, the array is already non-beautiful
        if not operations:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of removals needed
        min_removals = float('inf')
        for i in range(len(operations)):
            start = operations[i]
            end = start + 1
            while end < n and a[end] != a[start]:
                end += 1
            min_removals = min(min_removals, n - (end - start))
        
        print(min_removals)

func()
```

This program correctly identifies positions where the operation can be applied and calculates the minimum number of removals needed to ensure the array is no longer beautiful.
