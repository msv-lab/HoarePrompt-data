Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by finding the minimum length of the longest sequence of identical elements in the array. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not actually determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. Instead, it simply finds the length of the longest sequence of identical elements, which does not correlate with the required solution.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should identify the indices where the conditions for making the array non-beautiful can be met. Specifically, it needs to find the minimum number of removals such that no two adjacent elements satisfy the condition \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

Given the execution summary, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
