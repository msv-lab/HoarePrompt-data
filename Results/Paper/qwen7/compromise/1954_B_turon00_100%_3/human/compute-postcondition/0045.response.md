Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to `n`.
   - The variable `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(n):` to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
   - We also need to set `i` to `n`.

Given these points, we can now formulate the required state:

**State:**
- `ans` is equal to `n`
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input
- `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`
- `cnt` is 0
- Either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`
- `_` is incremented by 1

However, since we are focusing on the loop head, we only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
