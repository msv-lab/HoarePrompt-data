Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split by spaces, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. Since `a` is a list of integers obtained from an input string split by spaces, and `tmp` is set to `a[0]`, `tmp` now holds the first integer from the list. The values of `n` and the rest of the list `a` remain unchanged.
