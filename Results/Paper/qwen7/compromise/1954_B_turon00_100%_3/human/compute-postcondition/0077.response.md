Output State: **`t` is 0, `ans` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `i` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `tmp` is `a[0]`**.

The code sets `cnt` to 0, which updates the value of `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
