Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `tmp` remains the same.**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. The values of `cnt`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `tmp` are updated according to their respective rules (i.e., `cnt` is updated, `i` is incremented by 1), while `ans` is updated based on the comparison. The other variables remain unchanged.
