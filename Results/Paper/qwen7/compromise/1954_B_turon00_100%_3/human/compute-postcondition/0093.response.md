Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values and conditions**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.
   - `cnt` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0] == tmp` or not.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 in the `range(n)` function, after the first iteration, `i` becomes 1. For the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < n`. Since `i` is now 1 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop can still execute as long as `n` remains greater than 1 (because `i` will be incremented to 2).

4. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue, but since `n` was greater than 0 before and there's no indication that it has changed, we assume it remains greater than 0.
   - The values of `ans` and `cnt` are not directly affected by the loop head, so they are not adjusted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
