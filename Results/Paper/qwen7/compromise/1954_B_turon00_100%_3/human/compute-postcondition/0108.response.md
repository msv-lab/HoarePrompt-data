Output State: `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the entire loop execution, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` remains the same as the initial input, `a` remains the same list of integers, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, and `cnt` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. If `n == 1` or `ans == n`, the condition is satisfied, and `-1` will be printed. Otherwise, the final value of `ans` will be printed.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `ans` will hold the smallest sequence length where the elements are the same as the first element in the list `a`. If the list has only one element or the smallest sequence length equals the length of the list, `-1` will be printed. Otherwise, the smallest sequence length will be printed.
