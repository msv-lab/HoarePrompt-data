Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and the input is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `t` will always be a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the state**: Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it will always be greater than 0, ensuring the loop can execute. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

4. **Consider other variables**: All other variables remain in their initial state, and since they are not involved in the loop head, no adjustments are necessary for them.

Based on this reasoning, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **No adjustments needed**
