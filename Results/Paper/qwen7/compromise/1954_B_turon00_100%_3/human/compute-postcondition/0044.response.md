Output State: **`ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, either `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, or `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`, `_` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans = n` assigns the value of `n` to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions involving `n` and `ans` also remain valid as they are not directly affected by this assignment.
