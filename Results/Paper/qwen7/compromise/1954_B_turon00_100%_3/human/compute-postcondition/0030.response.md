Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, the output state will be as follows:
- `cnt` will be 0 because it is reset to 0 whenever `a[i]` does not equal `tmp`.
- `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
- `n` will remain the same as the initial input.
- `a` will remain the same as the initial input list of integers.
- `tmp` will remain the same as the first element of the list `a`.
- `ans` will be the minimum value between `ans` (initially set to `n`) and `cnt` for every segment of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp`.

In summary, `ans` will hold the length of the longest segment of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
