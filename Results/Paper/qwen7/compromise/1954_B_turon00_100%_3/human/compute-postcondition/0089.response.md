Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` remains either 1 (if `a[0] == tmp`) or 0 (if `a[0] != tmp`).**

Explanation: The line `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states.
