Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the minimum value between its initial value (`n`) and `cnt`, which is 0.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `n` remains the same as the initial input.
- `a` remains the same as the initial input list of integers.
- `tmp` remains the same as the first element of the list `a`.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `n` is not equal to 1.
- `ans` is not equal to `n`.

Given these conditions, since `cnt` is 0, `ans` will be the minimum value between `n` and 0. Since `n` is not equal to 1, the minimum value between `n` and 0 is 0.

Therefore, the value of `ans` when the print statement is executed is 0.

Output: **0**
