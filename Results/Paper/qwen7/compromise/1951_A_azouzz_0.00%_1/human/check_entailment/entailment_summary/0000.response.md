Reasoning:
The given program consists of two separate functions and does not match the problem description or the execution summary provided. The problem description and execution summary describe a function that processes a range of directory folders and generates corresponding Python files for `.html` files found within those directories. However, the provided code defines a function `func_1` that reads multiple test cases from standard input and performs a specific check on strings.

Given the discrepancy between the problem description and the provided code, the program does not correctly implement the intended functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
