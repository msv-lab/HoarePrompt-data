The function processes multiple inputs, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a string `s`. It checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each input. Specifically, it prints 'YES' if the count of '1's in `s` is 2 or less, or if '11' does not appear in `s`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
