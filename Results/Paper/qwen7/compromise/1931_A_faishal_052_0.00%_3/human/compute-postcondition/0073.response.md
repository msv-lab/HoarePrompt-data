Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 2.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cases` is 3
   - `arr` is either `[1]` or `[26]`
   - `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive (since it was less than 2 in the previous iteration)
   - `lex` is an input integer

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, after the previous iteration, `j` is either 0 or 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value (either 0 or 1) to reach 2.

Therefore, `j` will be adjusted to 1 if it was 0, or to 2 if it was 1.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1]` or `[26]`, `j` is 1, and `lex` is an input integer**.

If `j` was 1 initially, then the state will be:

State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1]` or `[26]`, `j` is 2, and `lex` is an input integer**.

Since both cases are valid, we can summarize the state as:

State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1]` or `[26]`, `j` is 1 or 2, and `lex` is an input integer**.
