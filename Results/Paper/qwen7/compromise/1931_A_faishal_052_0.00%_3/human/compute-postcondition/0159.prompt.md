Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an input integer and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    arr = []
    lex = int(input())
    for j in range(2):
        if lex <= 26:
            arr.append(1)
            lex = lex - 1
        elif lex < 52:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
        else:
            arr.append(26)
            lex = lex - 26
    arr.append(lex)
    arr.sort()
    for k in range(3):
        print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'aabbcc'.

Explanation: The loop runs three times as specified by `range(3)`. Each iteration prints a character based on the value in `arr` converted from a number to a character using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`. Given the initial state where `arr` is `[1, 1, lex]`, the first two elements are `1`, which correspond to 'a' when converted (since `chr(1+96)` is `'a'`). The third element is `lex`, which is a value less than or equal to 27, so it will convert to a character between 'a' and 'z'. After three iterations, the loop prints 'aabbcc', assuming `lex` is `3` (resulting in 'c').

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a', 'b', 'c' in sequence without spaces.

Explanation: Since the loop runs 3 times (as specified in `range(3)`), and each iteration prints `chr(arr[k] + 96)`, where `arr` starts as either `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, etc., and is sorted, the values of `arr` will be `[1, 26, 26]` or similar depending on the initial setup. After sorting, the first three elements are `1`, `26`, `26`. Converting these to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` results in 'a', 'z', 'z'. However, since the loop only accesses the first three elements and prints them sequentially, the output will be 'a', 'b', 'c' in that order, corresponding to the ASCII values 97 ('a'), 98 ('b'), 99 ('c') when starting from 1. Thus, after all iterations, the output is 'abc'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a', 'b', and 'c' in sequence.

Explanation: Given the loop iterates 3 times (as per the range(3)), and each iteration prints the character corresponding to the current value of `arr[k] + 96`, where `arr` is sorted as [1, 26, lex]. Since `lex` is less than or equal to 26, the sorted array will be [1, 26, lex], making the characters printed 'a', 'b', and 'c'. After all iterations, the loop finishes, and the output is 'abc'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
