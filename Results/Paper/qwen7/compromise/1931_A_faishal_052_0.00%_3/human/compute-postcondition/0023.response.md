Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26, and `arr` contains the elements [1, 26]**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was initially a value less than or equal to 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` will now be a value less than or equal to 26. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
