Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`, `j` is 1 or 2, and `lex` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. Depending on the initial state, `arr` could be either `[1]` or `[26]`. After appending `26`, `arr` becomes either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`. The values of `cases`, `j`, and `lex` remain unchanged.
