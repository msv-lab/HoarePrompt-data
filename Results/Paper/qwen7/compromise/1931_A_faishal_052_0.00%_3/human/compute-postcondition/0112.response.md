Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26; `arr` is [1]**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, `j` is `0` and `lex` is a value less than or equal to `26`, which remain unchanged. The list `arr` was initially empty and now contains the element `1`.
