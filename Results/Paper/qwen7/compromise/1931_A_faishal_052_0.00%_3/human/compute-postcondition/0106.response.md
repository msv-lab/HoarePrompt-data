Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a', 'b', 'c' in sequence without spaces.

Explanation: Since the loop runs 3 times (as specified in `range(3)`), and each iteration prints `chr(arr[k] + 96)`, where `arr` starts as either `[1, 1, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, etc., and is sorted, the values of `arr` will be `[1, 26, 26]` or similar depending on the initial setup. After sorting, the first three elements are `1`, `26`, `26`. Converting these to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` results in 'a', 'z', 'z'. However, since the loop only accesses the first three elements and prints them sequentially, the output will be 'a', 'b', 'c' in that order, corresponding to the ASCII values 97 ('a'), 98 ('b'), 99 ('c') when starting from 1. Thus, after all iterations, the output is 'abc'.
