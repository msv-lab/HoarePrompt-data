Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a', 'b', 'c'.

Explanation: Since the loop runs for 3 iterations (as indicated by the `range(3)`), it prints the characters corresponding to the first three elements in the sorted `arr`. Given the initial setup where `arr` contains the elements 1, 26, and a value less than or equal to 26 (let's denote it as `lex`), sorted in ascending order, the first three elements of `arr` will always be 1, 26, and `lex` (assuming `lex` is less than or equal to 26). However, since we are only interested in the first three elements for the loop, they will be 1, 26, and the smallest possible value for `lex` which is 2 (since `lex` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 26).

- The first iteration (`k=0`): Prints `chr(1 + 96)`, which is 'a'.
- The second iteration (`k=1`): Prints `chr(26 + 96)`, which is 'z' (if `lex` was 26).
- The third iteration (`k=2`): Prints `chr(2 + 96)`, which is 'b'.

Thus, the output state after all iterations is the string 'abc'.
