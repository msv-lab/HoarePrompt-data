Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for k in range(3)`. The variable `k` is being iterated over the range from 0 to 2.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `k` is 0.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue if `k` is less than 3. Since `k` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute again as long as `k` is less than 3.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: After the previous iteration where `k` was 0, the next value of `k` will be 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than 3. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be 1.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `k`, and it should be set to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is 1**
