Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for k in range(3)`. The variables involved here are `k`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 0.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than 3. Since `k` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute again if `k` is less than 3.

4. **Calculate the new value of `k`**: After the first iteration, `k` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than 3. Therefore, `k` should be set to 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `k`, and it should be set to 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`k` is 1**
