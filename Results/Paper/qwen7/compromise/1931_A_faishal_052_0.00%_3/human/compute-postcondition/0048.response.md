Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for k in range(3)`. This means the loop variable is `k`.

2. **Determine the initial value and condition for the loop**: The loop starts with `k` being 0 and increments `k` by 1 each iteration until `k` is no longer less than 3.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `k` is 1.

4. **Check if the loop can execute again**: For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than 3. Since `k` is currently 1, it is indeed less than 3, so the loop can execute one more time.

5. **Update the state for the next iteration**: After the next iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`k` is 2**
