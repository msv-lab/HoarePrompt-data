Output State: **`j` is 2; `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26; `arr` contains the elements 1, 26, and 1.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the element `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the elements `1` and `26`. After appending `1` to `arr`, the list `arr` now contains `1`, `26`, and `1`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
