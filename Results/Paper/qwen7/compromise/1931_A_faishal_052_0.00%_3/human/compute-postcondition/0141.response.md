Output State: **`j` is 2; `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26; `arr` contains the elements 1, 26, and 26**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contained the elements 1 and 26. After appending 26, `arr` now contains the elements 1, 26, and 26. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
