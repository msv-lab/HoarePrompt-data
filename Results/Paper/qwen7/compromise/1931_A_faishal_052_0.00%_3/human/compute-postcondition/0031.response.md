Output State: **`j` is 2; `lex` is a value less than or equal to 53; `arr` contains the elements [1, 1]**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the element `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contained the element `[1]`. After appending `1`, `arr` now contains the elements `[1, 1]`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
