Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26; `arr` is [1]**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `arr`. Since `j` and `lex` are not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the list `arr`.
