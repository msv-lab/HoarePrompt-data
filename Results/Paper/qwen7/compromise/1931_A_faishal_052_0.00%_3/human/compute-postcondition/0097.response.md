Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is one of the following lists: `[1, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, `[26, 26, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, `[26, 26, 26]`, `j` is 2, and `lex` is appended to `arr`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Since `lex` is an integer that has been reduced by either 1 or 26 for each element in the final list `arr` depending on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop, appending `lex` to `arr` does not change the fact that `arr` contains exactly 3 elements which can be either 1 or 26. The value of `cases` remains 3, `j` remains 2, and `lex` is now part of the list `arr`.
