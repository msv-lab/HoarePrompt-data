Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `i` is 1, `arr` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `lex = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `lex`. The initial values of `cases`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `arr` remains an empty list. The new variable `lex` is introduced with the value of the user's input.
