The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` where each integer represents a multiplier \(k_i\) for the i-th outcome, and the length of the list is between 1 and 50, inclusive. Each \(k_i\) satisfies 2 ≤ \(k_i\) ≤ 20. It initializes the variable `result` with the first element of the list and then applies the function `func_1` successively to `result` and each subsequent element of the list up to the third element if they exist. Finally, it returns the updated value of `result`.
