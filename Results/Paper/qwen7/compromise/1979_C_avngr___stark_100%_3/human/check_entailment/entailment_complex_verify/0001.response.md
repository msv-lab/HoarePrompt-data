### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the problem statement step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Statement Recap
The problem requires distributing coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Each outcome has a multiplier \(k_i\), and the goal is to find a distribution of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all } i \]

#### Given Functions Recap
1. **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
   \]
2. **func_2(numbers)**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers. It iteratively applies `func_1` to compute the LCM of the entire list.

#### Program Logic Recap
The program does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases \(t\).
2. For each test case:
   - Reads the number of outcomes \(n\).
   - Reads the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - Computes the LCM of all multipliers using `func_2`.
   - Distributes the total bet equally among all outcomes.
   - Checks if the total bet is less than the amount received back for each outcome.
   - Prints the distribution or `-1` if the condition is not met.

#### Correctness Check
1. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM calculation using `func_2` is correct and works as expected.
2. **Distribution Logic**: The program distributes the total bet equally among all outcomes. Let \(m\) be the LCM of the multipliers. The program sets \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\) for each outcome \(i\).
3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the total bet \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \) is less than \( k_i \cdot c_i \) for each outcome. Since \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\), the total bet is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{m}{k_i} \). For the condition to hold:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{m}{k_i} < k_i \cdot \frac{m}{k_i} = m
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k_i} < 1
   \]
   Given that \(2 \leq k_i \leq 20\), the sum of the reciprocals of the multipliers is always less than 1. Therefore, the condition is always satisfied.

Since the program correctly computes the LCM and distributes the bets such that the condition is always met, the program is indeed solving the problem correctly.

### Conclusion
The original assessment was incorrect because the program does correctly solve the problem as specified. The program uses the LCM to distribute the bets and ensures that the condition is always satisfied.

**Correctness: True**

Final: **True**
