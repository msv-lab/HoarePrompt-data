### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided functions only compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers but do not implement the necessary logic to distribute the bets correctly. Let's break down the program and the problem again to confirm this.

#### Problem Recap
We need to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Specifically, for each outcome \(i\), the condition is:
\[ \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i \]

#### Provided Functions
1. **func_1(a, b)**: Computes the LCM of two numbers using the formula:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
   \]
2. **func_2(numbers)**: Computes the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

#### Program Logic
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases, the number of outcomes for each test case, and the multipliers for each outcome.
2. **Computing LCM**: For each test case, it computes the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
3. **Distributing Bets**: It then distributes the total bet across the outcomes in such a way that the total bet is equal to the computed LCM.
4. **Checking Condition**: It checks if the total bet is less than the amount received back for each outcome. If not, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the distribution of bets.

#### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Distribution Logic**: The program does not actually distribute the bets in a way that ensures the condition is met. Instead, it sets the bet for each outcome to be the LCM divided by the multiplier for that outcome, which does not necessarily satisfy the condition.
2. **No Validation of Condition**: The program does not validate if the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each outcome before printing the distribution.

#### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve:
1. Computing the LCM of the multipliers.
2. Distributing the total bet such that the condition is satisfied for each outcome. One possible method is to set the bet for each outcome to be a fraction of the LCM, ensuring the total bet is less than the amount received back for each outcome.

### Final Evaluation
Given the issues identified, the original assessment correctly concluded that the program is not solving the problem as specified. The provided functions and logic do not ensure that the condition is met for each outcome.

**Final: False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly distribute the bets to satisfy the required condition.
