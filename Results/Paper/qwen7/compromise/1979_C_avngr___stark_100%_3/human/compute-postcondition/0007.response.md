Output State: `result` is equal to `func_1(func_1(func_1(result, numbers[1]), numbers[2]), numbers[3])`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `result` variable will hold the value obtained by successively applying the `func_1` function to the initial `result` and each element of the `numbers` list, starting from the second element and going to the last element of the list.
