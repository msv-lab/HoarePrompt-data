Output State: The final value of `result` is equal to `func_1(func_1(func_1(result, numbers[1]), numbers[2]), numbers[3])`.

In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `result` will be the result of applying the function `func_1` successively to the initial `result` and each element of the `numbers` list starting from the second element. This means `result` will be transformed as follows: first with `numbers[1]`, then with `numbers[2]`, and finally with `numbers[3]` if the list has at least four elements.
