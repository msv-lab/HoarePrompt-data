Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotion rules.

Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Calculating \( k \)**: It calculates \( k \) as the minimum of \( n \) and \( b - a \). This ensures that \( k \) is within the valid range and maximizes the benefit from the promotional price.
3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If \( b \leq a \), it means there is no benefit from the promotion, so the program simply prints \( a \times n \).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula:
     - The sum of the first \( k \) terms of an arithmetic series starting from \( b \) with a decrement of 1.
     - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

The formula used to calculate the sum of the first \( k \) terms of the arithmetic series is:
\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1)) \]

This is correct because the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is \( b \) and the last term is \( b - k + 1 \) with \( k \) terms is given by the above formula.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the expected results for the given problem.
