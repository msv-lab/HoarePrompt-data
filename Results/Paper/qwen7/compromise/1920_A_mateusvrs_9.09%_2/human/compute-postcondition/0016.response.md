Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is an input integer.**

The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was initially an empty set, after adding `x`, it now contains only `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
