Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values that were added during the loop's iterations, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the set `cx`, the minimum value `ax`, the maximum value `bx`, and the last integer inputs `a` and `x` remain as they were before the input was taken.
