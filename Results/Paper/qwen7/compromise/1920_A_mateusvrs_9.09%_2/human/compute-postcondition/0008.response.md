Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The values of `n`, `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged. The input integers are stored in `a` and `x`, so they are now known to be specific integers.
