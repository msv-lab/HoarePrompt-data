Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is assigned the value of the first integer entered, `x` is assigned the value of the second integer entered.**

This means that the initial conditions for `n` and the types of `a` and `x` remain unchanged, but now `a` and `x` have specific values based on user input.
