Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is an integer from the input, and either `a` is 1 and `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`, or `a` is 2 and `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 2, or `a` is an integer (not equal to 1 and not equal to 2) and `x` is added to the set `cx`.
