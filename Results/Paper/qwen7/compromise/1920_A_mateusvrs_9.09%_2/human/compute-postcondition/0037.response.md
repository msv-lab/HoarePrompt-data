Postcondition: `n` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values that were added during the loop's iterations, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values that were processed when `a` was 1, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration. Additionally, the value of `bx` is greater than or equal to the value of `ax`.
