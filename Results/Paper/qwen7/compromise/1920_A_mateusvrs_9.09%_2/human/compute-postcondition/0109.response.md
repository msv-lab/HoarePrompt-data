Output State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1 (i.e., `tmp` is now `tmp + 1`).**

This means that the value of `tmp` has been incremented by 1, while the sets `cx` and the variable `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
