Output State: **`bx` is -1, `n` must be greater than 1, `cx` is a set containing `x` if `a` is not equal to 1, otherwise `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is assigned the value of an input integer, `x` is assigned the value of another input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns the first to `a` and the second to `x`. The initial conditions for `bx`, `n`, `cx`, and `ax` remain unchanged.
