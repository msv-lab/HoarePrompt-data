Output State: **`tmp` is 3, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `a` is the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `x` is the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `ax` is the smallest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set containing all integers provided as `x` when `a` was neither 1 nor 2 and must have at least one element (with the current value of `i` removed), and the new value of `i` is the next element in `cx` that satisfies the condition `i >= bx` and `i <= ax`.**

Explanation: The line `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since `tmp` was initially 2, after executing this line, `tmp` becomes 3. The values of `n`, `a`, `x`, `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code. The new value of `i` is determined based on the conditions specified for `cx`, but since the exact values of `cx`, `bx`, and `ax` are not provided, these conditions remain as they were.
