Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `r` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `r`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of `t` and `n` while adding the new information about `r` being an empty list.
