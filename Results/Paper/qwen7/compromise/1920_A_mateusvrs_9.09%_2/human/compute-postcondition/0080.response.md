Output State: **`bx` is -1, `n` must be greater than 1, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was initially a set containing `x` if `a` is not equal to 1, or an empty set if `a` is equal to 1, adding `x` to `cx` means `cx` now contains `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
