Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and `a`.**

Explanation: The line `ax = min(x, ax)` updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of the current values of `x` and `a`. Since `a` is initially set to the value of the first integer entered and `x` is set to the value of the second integer entered, `ax` will now hold the smaller of these two values. The conditions and values of `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
