Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was not 1, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration, with `tmp` being 0, and `bx` being less than `ax`.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1, `i` is one of the elements in `cx`. If the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, the condition is met and no further changes occur. If the condition is not met, the values of `cx`, `i`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
