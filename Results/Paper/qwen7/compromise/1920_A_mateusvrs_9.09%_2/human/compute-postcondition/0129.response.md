Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is added to the set `cx`, and `a` is not equal to 1. The value of `a` is not 2.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. The values of `n`, `a`, and the condition that `a` is not equal to 1 and is not 2 remain unchanged.
