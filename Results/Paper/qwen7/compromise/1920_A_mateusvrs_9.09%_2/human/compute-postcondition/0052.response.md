Output State: **`cx` is a non-empty set, `i` is the first element in `cx`, `tmp` is the value of `tmp` after the previous iteration plus 1**

Explanation: The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. The values of `cx` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. `tmp` is updated to its previous value plus 1.
