Output State: **`ax` is 1000000007, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `cx` is an empty set, `bx` is -1, `r` is a list with either the value 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` appended, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration.**

Explanation: The variable `bx` is assigned the value `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
