Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` must be at least 1
   - `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
   - The postcondition involves either breaking out of the loop or not changing `i`, `x`, or `n`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, x):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < x`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will run as long as `i < x`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range and is determined before the loop starts.
   - The value of `n` also remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but there is no indication that the loop body changes `n`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be at least 1, `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive)**
