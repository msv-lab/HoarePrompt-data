Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This variable is not used in the loop, so it does not affect the loop's execution.
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\). This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(p_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct. This list is not used in the loop either.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Given the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), `n` will always be greater than or equal to 1.

4. **Adjust the state of the variables in the loop head**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive)**.
