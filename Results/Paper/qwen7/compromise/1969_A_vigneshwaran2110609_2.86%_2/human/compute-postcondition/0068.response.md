Postcondition: `l` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the range of the list `l`, `x` is the upper limit of the range, and `flag` remains unchanged. If `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`, then `flag` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `flag` remains unchanged.
