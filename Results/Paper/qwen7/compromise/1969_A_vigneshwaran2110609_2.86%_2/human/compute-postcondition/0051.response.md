Output State: **`i` is 50, `x` is an input integer, `n` must be greater than 50, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

The code creates a list `l` by taking a single line of space-separated integers as input, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, splitting the string into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged, and the condition for `n` being greater than 50 is not directly affected by this code snippet.
