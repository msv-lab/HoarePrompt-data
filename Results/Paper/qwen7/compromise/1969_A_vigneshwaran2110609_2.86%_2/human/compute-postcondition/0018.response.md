Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` must be at least 1
   - `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
   - The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` determines whether `flag` is set to True and the loop is broken out of.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `x-1`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Since the loop starts from `0` and goes up to `x-1`, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
   - `x` and `n` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but based on the given information, they do not change.
   - `flag` remains unchanged unless the condition inside the loop is met.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be `2` because it is incremented by 1 from its previous value of `1`.
- `x` remains at least `1`.
- `n` remains between `2` and `50` (inclusive).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be at least 1, `n` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive)**.
