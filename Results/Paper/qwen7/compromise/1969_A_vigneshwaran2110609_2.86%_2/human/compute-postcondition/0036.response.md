Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `x`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive).

4. **Loop Execution for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x`.
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - Therefore, `x` must still be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `x` remains unchanged and must still be between 2 and 50 (inclusive).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive)**.
