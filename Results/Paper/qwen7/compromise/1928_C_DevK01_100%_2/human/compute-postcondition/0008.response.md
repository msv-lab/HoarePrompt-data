Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < w`.
2. **Determine the current state of the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer.

3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` (which is 1) must be less than `w`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is 1, `w` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.
   - The value of `w` is determined by the integer square root of `q`. Therefore, `q` must be such that its square root is an integer and is greater than 1.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `q` must be a perfect square and greater than 1.
   - `w` must be the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 1.

Given these conditions, the state right before the loop should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 1, `q` is a perfect square greater than 1, `w` is the integer square root of `q` and must be greater than 1**
