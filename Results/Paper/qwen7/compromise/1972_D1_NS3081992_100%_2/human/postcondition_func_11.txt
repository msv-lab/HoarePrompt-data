The function processes a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` indicating whether nodes have been processed, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` initialized to zeros. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1, otherwise, it recursively calculates the minimum value of `tmp + 1` for all unprocessed nodes connected to `da`, updates the `rank` list accordingly, and returns the calculated value.
