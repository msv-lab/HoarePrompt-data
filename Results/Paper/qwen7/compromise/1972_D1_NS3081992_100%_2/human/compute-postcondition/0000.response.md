Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the product of n and m does not exceed 2⋅10^6; they have been assigned new values from the function `func_7()`**.

This means that the function `func_7()` has returned two new values for `n` and `m`, which are still within the specified constraints. The exact values of `n` and `m` are not known without knowing the implementation of `func_7()`, but they satisfy the conditions given in the initial state.
