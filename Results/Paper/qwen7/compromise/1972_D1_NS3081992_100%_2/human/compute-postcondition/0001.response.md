Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the product of n and m does not exceed 2⋅10^6.**

Explanation: The code initializes `i` to 1. This assignment does not affect the values of `n` and `m`, which are still positive integers within the specified range. Therefore, the output state retains the information about `n` and `m` while updating `i` to 1.
