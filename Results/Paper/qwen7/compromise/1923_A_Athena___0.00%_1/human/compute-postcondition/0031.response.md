Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is an index within the bounds of `a`.
   - `len(a)` remains the same.
   - `res` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is equal to 0. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(a)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `len(a) - 1`.
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - The length of the list `a` does not change during the loop execution.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` will be increased by 1 from its current value.
   - The length of the list `a` remains the same, so `len(a)` does not change.
   - The value of `res` depends on the condition `a[i] == 0`. However, since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we do not need to consider the exact value of `res` unless it changes due to the loop body, which is omitted here.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1` (assuming `i` was within bounds).
   - `len(a)` remains the same.
   - `res` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume `res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `a` (i.e., `i + 1`), `len(a)` remains the same, and `res` remains unchanged.**
