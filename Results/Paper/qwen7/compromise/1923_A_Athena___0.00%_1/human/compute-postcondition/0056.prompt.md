Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `res` is 0, `a` is a list where all elements starting from the first one have been removed because they were initially 0.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `a` will be a list containing only the non-zero elements from the original list, starting from the second element. The variable `res` remains unchanged at 0 because it was not modified within the loop.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is 0, `a` does not have its last element as 0 and is one element shorter than before
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is now a list with the last element removed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `a` is a list with its last element removed and the last element was 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
