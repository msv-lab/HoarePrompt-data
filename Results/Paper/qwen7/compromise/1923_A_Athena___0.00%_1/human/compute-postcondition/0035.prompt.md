Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `res` is 0, `a` is an empty list or a list with no leading zeros.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have had all its leading zeros removed. This means that either `a` is now an empty list (if all elements were zeros) or it is a non-empty list with no leading zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == 0:
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, and `i` is an index within the bounds of `a`. If `a[i]` is 0, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, the value of `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `a`, `len(a)` remains the same, and `res` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is equal to 0. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `a`, `len(a)` remains the same, `res` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is equal to 0, and `res` remains unchanged otherwise.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
