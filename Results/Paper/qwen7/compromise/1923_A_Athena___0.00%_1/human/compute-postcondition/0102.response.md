Output State: **`res` is 2, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the first element is not 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, and the current value of `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is undefined**.

Explanation: The variable `res` was initially set to 1. After executing `res += 1`, the value of `res` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables (`a`, `t`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
