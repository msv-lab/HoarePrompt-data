Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, splits the input string into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list from these integers. The variable `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
