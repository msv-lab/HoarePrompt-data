Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `res` is 0, `a` is a list where all leading zeros have been removed, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.

Explanation: The loop continues to remove elements from the front of the list `a` as long as the first element is 0. After all iterations of the loop, `a` will no longer start with any 0s, but it may still contain other elements. The variable `res` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop, and `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the second last element is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `res` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the last two elements are 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `res` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the last element is no longer 0, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
