Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input, `t` is t-1, `n` is an input integer, and `res` is the total count of leading zeros in the list `a` before any were removed.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. This means that `a` is now a list of integers. The values of `t`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state.
