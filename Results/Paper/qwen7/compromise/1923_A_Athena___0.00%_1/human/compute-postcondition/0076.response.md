Output State: **`res` is equal to the number of zeros found in the original list starting from the second element, `a` is a list of integers split from the input, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. This input is stored in the list `a`. The variable `res` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation. The variable `t` and `n` remain as they were in the initial state since they are not involved in this particular operation.
