Based on the initial state provided:

- The list `a` has had all its leading zeros removed.
- `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `n` remains the original input integer.
- `res` is the total count of leading zeros in the list `a` before any were removed.

The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which represents the number of leading zeros in the original integer `n`.

Output: **res (where res is the total count of leading zeros in the original integer n before leading zeros were removed)**
