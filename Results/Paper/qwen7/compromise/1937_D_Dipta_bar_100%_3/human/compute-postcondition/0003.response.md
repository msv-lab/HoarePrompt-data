Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`. Therefore, we need to focus on adjusting the state of these variables.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 (as specified by the range function `range(0, n)`).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should start from 0 and increment until it reaches `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the State of `i` and `n`**: Given that the loop starts with `i` being 0, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 0 and `n` is such that the loop can execute at least once.

Based on this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
