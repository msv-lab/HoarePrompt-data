Output State: `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` after applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, `n` is the original length of `a`, `a` is the original list of `n` non-negative integers, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` after the bitwise operation, and its value is the difference between the number of times it appears in `a` and the number of times its counterpart (after the bitwise operation) appears. If a key does not appear in `count`, it means its counterpart appeared more times, and its value will be negative. If a key appears in `count`, it means it appeared more times than its counterpart, and its value will be positive or zero.
