### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires dividing the integers into groups such that no two integers in the same group share the same bit at any position from the 1st to the 31st bit. The solution uses a bitwise operation to transform the numbers and then counts the number of unique transformed numbers as the result.

2. **Bitwise Operation Explanation**:
   - The operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` flips all the bits of `num`. This transformation ensures that if two numbers `x` and `y` have different bits in any position from 1 to 31, their transformed versions will also differ in at least one bit. This is because flipping all bits of a number changes its binary representation significantly, making it easier to ensure uniqueness.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through each number in the list `a`, applies the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, and updates a counter (`count`) to keep track of how many times each transformed number appears.
   - If a number is encountered for the first time, it increments the result (`res`) and adds the transformed number to the counter.
   - If a number is encountered again, it decrements the counter for that number.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the value of `res`, which represents the number of unique transformed numbers. Since each unique transformed number corresponds to a unique group, `res` gives the minimum number of groups required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like duplicate numbers correctly by updating the counter appropriately.
   - The bitwise operation ensures that no two numbers with differing bits in any position from 1 to 31 will produce the same transformed number.

Given the logic and the bitwise operation used, the function correctly determines the minimum number of groups needed to satisfy the condition.
