Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes `n` and `a` as input.
   - It initializes `res` to 0, which will store the result (minimum number of groups).
   - It uses a dictionary `count` to keep track of the counts of transformed numbers.

3. **Transforming Numbers:**
   - The transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` is used to flip all bits of `num` except the sign bit (which is ignored since `num` is non-negative).
   - This transformation ensures that any two numbers with different bits in the 1st to 31st positions will map to different values after the transformation.

4. **Counting Groups:**
   - For each number `num` in `a`, it checks if `num` is already in `count`.
   - If not, it increments the count for the transformed value and increases `res` by 1.
   - If `num` is already in `count`, it decrements the count for the transformed value.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns `res`, which represents the minimum number of groups required.

### Verification:

To verify the correctness, let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

#### Example 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  4
  1 4 3 4
  ```
- Expected Output: 
  ```
  4
  ```

- Explanation: 
  - `1 = 00000000000000000000000000000001`
  - `4 = 00000000000000000000000000000100`
  - `3 = 00000000000000000000000000000011`
  - All these numbers have different bits in the 1st to 31st positions, so each number needs its own group.

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  2
  0 2147483647
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Explanation:
  - `0 = 00000000000000000000000000000000`
  - `2147483647 = 11111111111111111111111111111111`
  - These numbers have opposite bits in all positions, so they can be in the same group.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of groups required. It uses a transformation to ensure that numbers with differing bits in the 1st to 31st positions are mapped to different values, allowing the program to count the necessary groups accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
