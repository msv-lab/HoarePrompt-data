Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `x`.
2. **Divisor Calculation**: The function `func_1(x)` calculates all divisors of `x` and returns them in a specific order (quotients in descending order followed by divisors in descending order).
3. **Condition Checking**: The program checks two conditions:
   - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`: This condition ensures that the length of the settling sequence is even.
   - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`: This condition also ensures that the length of another potential settling sequence is even.
4. **Output Calculation**: For each valid divisor `s` found in `sep`, it checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`. If true, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to the `output` list.
5. **Duplicate Removal**: The `set` function removes duplicate values from the `output` list before calculating its length.
6. **Final Output**: The length of the `output` list is printed, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the logic seems to correctly implement the solution. The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of `x`, and the main part of the program correctly processes these divisors to find valid `k` values.

Correctness: **True**
