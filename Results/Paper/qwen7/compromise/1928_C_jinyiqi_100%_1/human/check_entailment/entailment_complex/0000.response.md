### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the described settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the sequence of numbers assigned to the positions is cyclic within each block of \( 2k - 2 \).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in descending order, followed by their corresponding quotients.
   - This helps identify potential candidates for \( k \) because \( k \) must be a divisor of \( 2(n - x) \) or \( 2(n + x - 2) \).

3. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The main logic checks if \( k \) can be derived from the divisors of \( 2(n - x) \) and \( 2(n + x - 2) \).
   - It ensures that \( k \) is greater than 1 and fits the condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \), where \( s \) is a divisor of \( 2(n - x) \) or \( 2(n + x - 2) \).

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) are handled correctly by checking the divisors and ensuring they meet the conditions.
   - The use of sets to remove duplicates and the final count of unique valid \( k \) values is appropriate.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the main part of the program correctly identifies the valid \( k \) values by leveraging the properties of divisors.
   - The function `func_1` is correctly implemented and used to find the divisors.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
