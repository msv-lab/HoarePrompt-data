Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values for \( k \) given the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the divisors of \( 2k - 2 \) play a crucial role in finding valid \( k \).

2. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes all divisors of \( x \), including both the divisors and their corresponding quotients when \( x \) is divided by these divisors.
   - This helps in identifying potential values of \( k \) since \( 2k - 2 \) must be a divisor of \( n + x - 2 \) or \( n - x \).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even because \( 2k - 2 \) must be even.
   - It then uses `func_1` to find all divisors of these even numbers.
   - For each divisor \( d \), it checks if \( (d + 2) / 2 \geq x \) to ensure the divisor fits the condition for \( k \).
   - The results are stored in a set to avoid duplicates and then the count of unique valid \( k \) values is printed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) is explicitly excluded by checking the conditions for even divisors.
   - The logic correctly identifies the valid \( k \) values based on the given constraints.

5. **Execution Summary**:
   - The provided execution summary matches the expected behavior of the program, confirming that the function `func_1` works as intended and the main logic correctly processes the input to produce the correct output.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
