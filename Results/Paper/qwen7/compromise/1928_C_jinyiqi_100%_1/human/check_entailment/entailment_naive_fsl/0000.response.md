Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is greater than `n`. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that `x` must be less than `n` as per the problem description. 

For instance, consider the following input:

```
10 10
```

Here, `n = 10` and `x = 10`. According to the problem description, `x` should be less than `n`, but the program does not check this condition. Therefore, it will incorrectly process this input and may produce an invalid result.

To fix this, the program should include a check at the beginning to ensure that `x < n`. If this condition is not met, the program should handle it appropriately, such as by returning 0 or raising an error.
