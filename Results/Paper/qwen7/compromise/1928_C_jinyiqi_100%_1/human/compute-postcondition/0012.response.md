Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
   - `i` is 3.
   - `output1` is a list containing 2 elements `[3, 3]`.
   - `output2` is a list containing 1 element `[int(x / 3)]` if `x` is divisible by 3, otherwise `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.

4. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, we need to check if `3 <= int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - If `3 <= int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, then `i` will be incremented to 4 in the next iteration.
   - If `3 > int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, the loop will terminate.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 4 if the loop continues.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged since they are not affected by the loop head variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 4, `output1` is a list containing 2 elements `[3, 3]`, `output2` is a list containing 1 element `[int(x / 3)]` if `x` is divisible by 3, otherwise `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.**
