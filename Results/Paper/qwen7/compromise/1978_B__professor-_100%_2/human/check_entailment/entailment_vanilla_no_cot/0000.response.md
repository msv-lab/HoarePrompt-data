Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given promotion rules. Let's break down why:

1. **Case where \( b \leq a \):**
   - If the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (\( b \)) is less than or equal to the usual price (\( a \)), then it is not beneficial to sell any buns at the modified price. Therefore, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). The profit is \( n \times a \).

2. **Case where \( b - a < n \):**
   - If the difference between the usual price and the modified price (\( b - a \)) is less than the number of buns, then Bob should sell as many buns as possible at the modified price. The formula used here is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) + (n - k) \times a
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
     Since \( k = b - a \), substituting \( k \) gives us the formula used in the code.

3. **Case where \( b - a \geq n \):**
   - If the difference between the usual price and the modified price is greater than or equal to the number of buns, then Bob should sell all buns at the modified price. The profit is the sum of the modified prices for all buns:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (b - i + 1) = \frac{n(2b - n + 1)}{2}
     \]

The program correctly handles all these cases and calculates the maximum profit accordingly. Therefore, the given program is correct.
