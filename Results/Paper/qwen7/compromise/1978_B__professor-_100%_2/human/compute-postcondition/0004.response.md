Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes three positive integers: n, a, and b. For each test case, it calculates the total cost of n buns considering that the first bun is sold at a modified price b, and all subsequent buns are sold at the usual price a. It then returns the total cost for each test case.**

Note: The function will process multiple test cases, each defined by the values of n, a, and b, and for each test case, it calculates the total cost based on the given conditions.
