### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the solution step-by-step:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Rows and Columns:**
   - The program only checks the first and last rows and columns, which is insufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. The problem allows selecting any subrectangle, not just rows and columns.

2. **Missing Consideration of Subrectangles:**
   - The program does not account for the possibility of making the entire grid uniform by selecting appropriate subrectangles. For example, if the grid has a checkerboard pattern, the program would incorrectly conclude it is possible to make all squares the same color.

3. **Potential False Positives:**
   - The program might incorrectly print 'YES' for some test cases where it is not possible to make all squares the same color using the allowed operations.

Given these issues, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the problem constraints and logic. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final: **False**
