Output State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 1, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input provided by the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the first element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends a new input provided by the user to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains one element which is the original input provided by the user. After executing the code, `a` now contains two elements: the original input and the new input. The variables `first_row` and `last_row` are updated based on the current state of the list `a`. `first_row` remains the same as it was initially (the first element of the first element in list `a`), and `last_row` is now the last element of the last element in list `a`, which is the new input provided by the user.
