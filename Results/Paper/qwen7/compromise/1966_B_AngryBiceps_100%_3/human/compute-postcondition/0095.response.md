Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid represented by `n` rows and `m` columns of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. For each test case, it checks if the first and last rows, as well as the first and last characters of each row, are uniform but different from each other. If any test case fails this condition, it prints 'NO' for that case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.**
