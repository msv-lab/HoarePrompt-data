Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from the user, `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each element in the list `a`, `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each element in the list `a`, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. The first integer is assigned to `n`, and the second integer is assigned to `m`. The values of `i`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged from their initial state.
