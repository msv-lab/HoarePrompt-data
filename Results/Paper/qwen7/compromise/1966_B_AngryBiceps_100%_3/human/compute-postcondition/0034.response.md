Output State: **`last_row` is an empty string, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list containing one element which is an input integer, `first_row` is the input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first (and only) element of the list `a` to the string `first_row`. Since `a` contains only one element which is an input integer, `first_row` becomes that integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
