Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` increments `first_row` by the first element of the only element in the list `a`. Since `a` has only one element, `a[-1]` refers to that single element, and `[0]` accesses its first element. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 because of the line preceding this snippet (not shown but implied to be `i += 1`). All other variables remain unchanged.
