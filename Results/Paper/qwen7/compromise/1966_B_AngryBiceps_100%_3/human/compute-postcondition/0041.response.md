Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer plus the last element of the last sublist in `a`, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is an input integer, the second element is the input from `input()`, and the third element is the new input from `input()`, `first_row` is the input integer plus the first element of the last sublist in `a`, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends a new input value to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains two elements: the first element is an input integer, and the second element is the input from `input()`. After appending the new input, `a` now contains three elements. The other variables remain unchanged.
