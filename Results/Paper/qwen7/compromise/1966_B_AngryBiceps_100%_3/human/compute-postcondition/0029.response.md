Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each element in the list `a`, `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each element in the list `a`, `m` is an input integer.**

The code `a = []` initializes `a` as an empty list, which changes the state of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
