Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from the user, `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each element in the list `a`, and `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each element in the list `a`. If the set of the first element in `a` contains only one unique character, the set of the last element in `a` contains only one unique character, and the first and last elements in `a` are not the same, then `first_row` and `last_row` both contain more than one unique character or `first_row` and `last_row` are equal. Otherwise, `first_row` contains at least two different characters, or `last_row` contains at least two different characters, or both the first and last elements of `a` contain only one character but are the same.**
