Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing the first element as the input from the user and one additional element which is the input from the user, `first_row` is the first element of the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last sublist in the list `a` plus the last element of the last sublist in the list `a`**.

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends a new element, which is the input from the user, to the list `a`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 2 remains unchanged. The variable `first_row` is still the first element of the list `a`, and `last_row` is the last element of the last sublist in the list `a` plus the last element of the last sublist in the list `a`. Since no sublists are mentioned, we assume `a` is a flat list, so `last_row` would simply be the last element of `a` added to itself.
