Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the number of iterations, which is determined by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This is because the loop runs for the number of times specified by this input.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `last_row` is the input integer plus `(n-1)` times the last element of the last sublist in `a`
   - `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from `input()`
   - `first_row` is the input integer plus the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`
   - `m` is an input integer
   - The conditions about the rows of `a` hold.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The only thing that changes is the number of iterations left, which is determined by the input at the start of the loop.
   - Since the loop runs for `int(input())` times, after one iteration, the number of remaining iterations is reduced by 1.

5. **New State**:
   - The new value of `int(input())` will be the original value minus 1.
   - All other variables (`i`, `n`, `last_row`, `a`, `first_row`, `m`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer plus `(n-1)` times the last element of the last sublist in `a`, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from `input()`, `first_row` is the input integer plus the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`, `m` is an input integer, and the number of remaining iterations is `int(input()) - 1`**.

However, since the problem specifies that only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted, and the only object in the loop head is the number of iterations, the final state adjustment is:

State: **`int(input()) - 1`**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`int(input()) - 1`**.
