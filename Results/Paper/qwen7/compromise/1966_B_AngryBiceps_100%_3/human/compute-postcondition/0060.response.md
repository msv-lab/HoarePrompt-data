Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `last_row` is the input integer plus `(n - 1)` times the last element of the last sublist in `a`.
   - `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from `input()`.
   - `first_row` is the input integer plus the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - The conditions regarding the rows of `a` are as follows:
     - Either the first row of `a` is a list with all elements the same, the last row of `a` is a list with all elements the same, and the first row is different from the last row.
     - Or the first row of `a` contains at least two different elements, or the last row of `a` contains at least two different elements, or the first row is equal to the last row.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `int(input())` must be positive.
   - Since `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will execute one more time if `int(input())` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The value of `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `n + 2`.
   - The value of `n` will remain the same unless the input changes the number of sublists in `a`.
   - The value of `last_row` will depend on the new `n` and the last element of the last sublist in the updated `a`.
   - The value of `first_row` will depend on the new `n` and the first elements of all sublists in the updated `a`.
   - The conditions regarding the rows of `a` will need to be re-evaluated based on the new `n`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer plus `(n - 1)` times the last element of the last sublist in `a`, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from `input()`, `first_row` is the input integer plus the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`, `m` is an input integer, and the following conditions hold:**
- Either the first row of `a` is a list with all elements the same, the last row of `a` is a list with all elements the same, and the first row is different from the last row.
- Or the first row of `a` contains at least two different elements, or the last row of `a` contains at least two different elements, or the first row is equal to the last row.
