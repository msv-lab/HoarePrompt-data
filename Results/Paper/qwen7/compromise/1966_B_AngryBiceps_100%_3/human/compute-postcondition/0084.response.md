Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `a` is a list of length `n` containing all the inputs in the order they were provided.
- `first_row` is a string formed by taking the first character of each string in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string formed by taking the last character of each string in `a`.
- The first element of `a` contains only one distinct character.
- The last element of `a` contains only one distinct character.
- `first_row` is not equal to `last_row`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string `'NO'` directly, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **NO**
