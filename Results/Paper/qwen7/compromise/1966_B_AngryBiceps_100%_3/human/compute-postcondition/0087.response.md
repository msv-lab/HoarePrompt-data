Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `a` is a list of length `n` containing all the inputs in the order they were provided.
- `first_row` is a string formed by taking the first character of each string in `a`.
- `last_row` is a string formed by taking the last character of each string in `a`.

Additionally, one of the following conditions must hold:
- The first element of `a` does not contain at least two distinct characters.
- The last element of `a` does not contain at least two distinct characters.
- The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

Given this, the print statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row`.

Output: **YES**
