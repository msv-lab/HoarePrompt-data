Output State: **`n` is an integer from `int(input()) - 1`, `m` is an integer from `input().split()`, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string.**

The code `last_row = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `last_row`. No other variables are affected, so their previous states remain unchanged.
