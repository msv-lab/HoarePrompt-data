    #
    #Explanation: The provided code aims to find segments in the array where the sum of elements is non-negative and updates the maximum segment found. However, the code logic does not seem to correctly update the `max_segment` or `new_segment` lists during the iterations. Given the initial conditions and the nature of the operations inside the loop, no segment with a positive sum is found, hence `max_sum` remains 0, `new_segment` and `max_segment` remain empty, and `segments_variants` also remains empty.
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: Output State: `max_sum` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is [[0, 0, len(arr) - 1]], `total_max_segment` is [0, 0, len(arr) - 1].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each `segment` in `segments_variants`. During each iteration, it checks if the first element of `total_max_segment` is less than the first element of the current `segment`. If it is, `total_max_segment` is updated to the current `segment`. Since `segments_variants` only contains one segment initially and no new segments are added or modified within the loop, `total_max_segment` will be updated to the only segment available in `segments_variants`, which is `[0, 0, len(arr) - 1]`. All other variables (`max_sum`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    if (len(total_max_segment) == 1) :
        total_max_segment = [-1]
    #State: `max_sum` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is [[0, 0, len(arr) - 1]], `total_max_segment` is [-1]
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns total_max_segment which is [-1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a list containing a single element, which is `-1`. The function attempts to find segments within the array where the sum of elements is non-negative and updates the maximum segment found. However, due to the logic in the code, no such segment is identified, resulting in the return value being `-1`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer representing the sum of the original array, and quantity is a non-negative integer representing the number of operations k.
def func_3(number, quantity):
    answer = 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `number` representing the sum of the original array and a non-negative integer `quantity` representing the number of operations k. It initializes a variable `answer` to 0 and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `answer` variable holds the value 0, regardless of the input parameters.
