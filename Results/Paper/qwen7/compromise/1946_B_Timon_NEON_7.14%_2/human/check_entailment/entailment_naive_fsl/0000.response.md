Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not address the main requirement of performing k operations to maximize the sum of the array. 

- `func_1` simply returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is not relevant to the problem.
- `func_2` attempts to find the maximum sum subarray, but it does not account for inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array multiple times (k operations). It only finds the maximum sum subarray once and does not consider the possibility of inserting this sum multiple times.
- `func_3` is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem.

Given the problem requires performing k operations to maximize the sum of the array, the current implementation does not handle this logic. For instance, consider the following input:

Input:
```
3 2
-1 -2 -3
```

Expected output: The maximum sum after 2 operations would be 0 (by inserting the sum of the entire array twice).

However, the current implementation would not achieve this result, indicating that the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases.
