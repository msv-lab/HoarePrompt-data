Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the given conditions: if \( b \leq a \), it prints \( n \times a \); if \( b - a \geq n \), it prints the sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( 2b - n + 1 \); otherwise, it prints the sum of an arithmetic sequence from \( a \) to \( b - a \) plus \( a \times n \). The function outputs a series of integers, one for each test case.**
