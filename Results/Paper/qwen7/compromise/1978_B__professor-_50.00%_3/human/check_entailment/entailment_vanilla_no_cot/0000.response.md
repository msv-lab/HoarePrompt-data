Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given conditions. Let's break down why:

1. **Case when `b <= a`:**
   - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, then it is not beneficial to use the promotion since the total revenue would decrease. Hence, the program correctly calculates the profit as `n * a`.

2. **Case when `b - a >= n`:**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, then it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price. The formula used `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (n-1)`.

3. **Case when `b - a < n`:**
   - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, then Bob should sell the first `k` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price. The formula used `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` correctly calculates the profit for this scenario.

The program handles all the given test cases correctly, as demonstrated by the example provided. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
