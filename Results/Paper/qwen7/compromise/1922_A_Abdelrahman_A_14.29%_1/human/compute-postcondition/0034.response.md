Postcondition: `no` is False, `tests` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is the value entered by the user, `c` is the value entered by the user, and the variable `x` is the last character in the string `c` that was checked, which means `x` is neither in `a` nor in `b`. The if condition is true because `no` is True.
