Output State: **`c` is a non-empty string, `x` is a value that is not present in list a and not present in list b, `no` is False**.

Explanation: The variable `no` is assigned the boolean value `False`. The values of `c` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `no` and retains the original values of `c` and `x`.
