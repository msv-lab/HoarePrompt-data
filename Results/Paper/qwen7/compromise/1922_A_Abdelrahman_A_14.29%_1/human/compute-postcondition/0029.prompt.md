Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: no is True, tests must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, i is 0, slength is an input integer, a is an input string, b is the value entered by the user, c is the value entered by the user, and c is neither equal to a nor equal to b
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a and x not in b:
        print('YES')
        no = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `c` is a non-empty string, `x` is a value that is not present in list `a` and not present in list `b`, `no` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the next character in the string `c`, `no` is False, and if `x` is not in `a` and not in `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the next character in the string `c`, and `no` remains `False`. If `x` is not in `a` and not in `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
