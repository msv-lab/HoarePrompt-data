Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). For each test case, the function returns different outputs based on the values of `t`, `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and based on these parameters, it performs some operations and returns a result. However, the exact nature of the operations and the specific return values are not detailed in the given information.
