Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `no` is False, and the loop has broken out of its execution. The variable `x` will be the last character in the string `c` that was checked, which means `x` is not in `a` and not in `b`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations, checking each character in the string `c`. If any character `x` was found that is not in `a` and not in `b`, the loop would have broken out, setting `no` to `False`. Since the loop has finished, `no` remains `False`, and `x` is the last character that satisfied the condition to break out of the loop.
