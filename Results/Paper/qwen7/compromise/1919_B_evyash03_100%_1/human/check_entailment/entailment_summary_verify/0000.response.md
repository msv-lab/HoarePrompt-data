Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to understand why the original assessment is correct.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to minimize the total penalty when splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays. The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The key insight is that the optimal strategy involves splitting the array at points where the cumulative sum changes sign, because these points can potentially minimize the overall penalty.

### Provided Solution Analysis
The provided solution calculates the number of '+' characters (`count`) and the number of '-' characters (`sub`), then returns the absolute difference between these two counts. This approach is flawed for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The solution does not consider the actual sums of subarrays or their lengths. Instead, it only counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns their difference. This does not account for the structure of the array or the penalties associated with different splits.

2. **Example Counterexample**: Consider the input:
   ```
   length = 6
   expression = "--++--"
   ```
   The solution would calculate:
   - `count = 2` (number of '+')
   - `sub = 4` (number of '-')
   - Return `abs(2 - 4) = 2`

   However, the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is:
   - `([--++], [--])`
   - Penalty calculation:
     - For `[--++]`: Sum = `-2`, Length = 4, Penalty = `|-2| * 4 = 8`
     - For `[--)`: Sum = `-2`, Length = 2, Penalty = `|-2| * 2 = 4`
     - Total Penalty = `8 + 4 = 12`

   The solution's output of `2` is incorrect, and the optimal penalty is `12`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The problem requires a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming, to find the minimum penalty. The current solution does not implement any such algorithm.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

Final: **False**
