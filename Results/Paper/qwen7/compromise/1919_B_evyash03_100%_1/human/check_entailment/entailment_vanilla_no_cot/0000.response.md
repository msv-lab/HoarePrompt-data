Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function `func_1` simply counts the number of '+' characters and calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters. This does not take into account the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

2. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of the elements in each subarray multiplied by the length of that subarray. The provided solution does not consider this calculation.

3. **Optimal Splitting**: The problem requires finding the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. The current implementation does not address this requirement.

To solve this problem correctly, one needs to consider dynamic programming or another approach to find the optimal splits. The provided code does not achieve this and hence is incorrect.
