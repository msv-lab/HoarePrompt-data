Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` and `numero_testes`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `numero_testes` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `numero_testes` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since `numero_testes` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, we need to make sure that this input results in a positive integer.

Given the constraints that `1 ≤ numero_testes ≤ 10^4`, we know that `numero_testes` will always be a valid positive integer if the input is within the specified range.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that `numero_testes` is greater than 0.

**State:**
**`numero_testes` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `numero_testes` ≤ 10^4, and it is greater than 0.**

This ensures that the loop will execute as intended.
