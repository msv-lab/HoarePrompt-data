Output State: **`soma_b` is 0, `n` is the same input integer, `k` is the same input integer, `pref` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, `resultado` is positive infinity, and `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**

Explanation: The line `resultado = float('inf')` assigns the value `positive infinity` to the variable `resultado`. No other variables are affected by this line of code, so their previous values remain unchanged.
