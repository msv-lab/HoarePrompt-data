Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` should start at `n - k`.
   - `n` remains the same as the input integer.

3. **Check if the loop can execute based on these initial values**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at `n - k` and `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` will always be less than `n` (assuming `k` is less than `n`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` must be set to `n - k`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Consider other relevant states**:
   - `pref` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`. This value is not directly affected by the loop initialization but is important for the loop body.
   - `resultado` is positive infinity and remains unchanged.
   - `lista_B` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive. This list is not directly modified by the loop initialization but is used in the loop body.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`i` is `n - k`, `n` is the same input integer**
