Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly solve the problem as described.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a queue of \( n \) people plus Kirill, who stands at the end.
   - For each person \( i \) in the queue, we have two values: \( a_i \) (cost to swap with Kirill directly) and \( b_i \) (cost for each person between Kirill and the person at position \( i \)).
   - Kirill wants to move to one of the first \( m \) positions in the queue with minimal cost.
   - The goal is to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to achieve this.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes \( n \), \( k \), `lista_A`, and `lista_B` as inputs.
   - `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed versions of the original lists `a` and `b`.
   - It calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the last \( n - k \) positions.
   - The logic involves:
     - Reversing the lists to start from the end.
     - Calculating the prefix sum of `lista_B` from the end.
     - Iterating from \( n - k \) to \( n \) to find the minimum cost.
   - This approach seems to be calculating the cost for moving Kirill from the end to the desired position, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case, passing the necessary parameters.
   - The function reads the number of test cases, then processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement matches the expected behavior of the functions.
   - The output for each test case in the example is calculated correctly using the given logic in `func_1`.

Given the analysis, both functions seem to correctly implement the solution for the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
