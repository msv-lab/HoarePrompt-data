Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not properly account for the costs associated with bribing people in the queue. 

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Input:
```
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

### Expected Output:
To move from position 4 to position 2, Kirill needs to bribe the people at positions 3 and 2.

- To move from position 4 to position 3, he pays 4 coins (b_3).
- To move from position 3 to position 2, he pays 3 coins (a_2).

So, the total cost should be \(4 + 3 = 7\) coins.

However, the program calculates the cost incorrectly. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the program does:

1. It reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
2. It initializes `soma_b` and `pref`.
3. It iterates through the first \(n-k\) elements and calculates the cost.
4. It then iterates through the remaining elements and calculates the minimum cost.

The program does not correctly handle the cumulative cost calculation and the transition between positions. Therefore, it fails to compute the correct minimum cost for moving Kirill to the desired position.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
