Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function reads three lines of input: `n` and `k` (separated by space), followed by two lists of `n` integers each (`lista_A` and `lista_B`).
   - It reverses both lists (`lista_A` and `lista_B`), which is unnecessary since the problem doesn't require them to be reversed.
   - It initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.
   - It iterates through the first `n-k` elements of the reversed lists, calculating `pref` and `soma_b` based on conditions involving `lista_A` and `lista_B`.
   - It then iterates from `n-k` to `n-1`, updating `resultado` to be the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.

2. **Function `func_2()` Analysis**:
   - The function reads an integer `numero_testes` indicating the number of test cases.
   - It calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The logic inside `func_1()` is correctly implemented to solve the problem for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - The implementation of the main logic in `func_1()` matches the problem statement and the provided example.
   - The function `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases and calls `func_1()` for each one.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to be correct according to the problem description and the example provided.

Correctness: **True**
