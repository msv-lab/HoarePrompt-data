Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reverses the input lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` to facilitate the calculation of the minimum cost.
   - It initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to keep track of cumulative sums.
   - The first loop calculates the prefix sum of `lista_B` up to index `n-k-1` and stores it in `pref`.
   - The second loop iterates from `n-k` to `n-1`, calculating the minimum cost by considering the current element in `lista_A` and the cumulative sum of `lista_B` from the previous steps.
   - The function correctly handles the logic to minimize the total cost while ensuring Kirill ends up within the first `m` positions.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function correctly processes multiple test cases by iterating `numero_testes` times.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
   - The function ensures that the input constraints are respected and that the output for each test case is printed correctly.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement. The logic in both functions aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
