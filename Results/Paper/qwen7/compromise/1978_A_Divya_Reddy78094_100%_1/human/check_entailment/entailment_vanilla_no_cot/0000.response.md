Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func` does not ensure that the books are divided into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the maximum books in each pile is maximized. Instead, it simply adds the last element of the list to the second largest element before the last, which does not guarantee the optimal solution.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider all possible ways to split the books into two piles and choose the split that gives the maximum sum of the maximum books in each pile. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
        max_pages = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            max_pages = max(max_pages, nums[i-1] + nums[i])
        results.append(max_pages)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the number of books and their page counts.
3. Sort the list of page counts in descending order.
4. Iterate through the sorted list to find the maximum sum of the maximum books in each pile.
5. Print the result for each test case.
