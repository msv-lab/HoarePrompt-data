#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is calculated as follows: starting from `ans[n-2]` which is `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, each subsequent element `ans[i]` (where i ranges from n-3 to 0) is updated to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`, `i` is now -1.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be -1, and each element in `ans` will have been updated according to the formula given by the loop, starting from `ans[n-2]` down to `ans[0]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `n` is the length of the list `arr` plus one. The last element `ans[n-2]` is `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, and each preceding element `ans[i]` (for i ranging from n-3 to 0) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`. The variable `i` ends up being -1 after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It calculates a new list `ans` of length `n` where the last element `ans[n-2]` is set to `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, and each preceding element `ans[i]` (for i ranging from n-3 to 0) is computed as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`. After completing these calculations, the function returns the list `ans`.
