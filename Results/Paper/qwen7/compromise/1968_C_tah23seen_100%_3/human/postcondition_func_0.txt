The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It calculates a new list `ans` of length `n` where the last element `ans[n-2]` is set to `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, and each preceding element `ans[i]` (for i ranging from n-3 to 0) is computed as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`. After completing these calculations, the function returns the list `ans`.
