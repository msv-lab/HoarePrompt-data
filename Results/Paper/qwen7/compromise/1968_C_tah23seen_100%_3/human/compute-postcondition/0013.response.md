Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `n` is the length of the list `arr` plus one. The last element `ans[n-2]` is `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, and each preceding element `ans[i]` (for i ranging from n-3 to 0) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`. The variable `i` ends up being -1 after the loop completes.**

This means the list `ans` starts from the end, with the last element being `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, and each preceding element is derived by subtracting the corresponding element in `arr` from the next element in `ans`. After processing all elements, `i` becomes -1, indicating the loop has completed.
