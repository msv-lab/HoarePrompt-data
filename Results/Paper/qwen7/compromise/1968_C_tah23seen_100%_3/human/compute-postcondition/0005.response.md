Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is `while i >= 0:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list of \( n-1 \) integers where \( 2 \leq n \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).
   - `ans` is a list of \( n \) elements where each element is \( 10^9 \) except `ans[n-2]` which is `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`.
   - `i` is \( n - 3 \).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - Currently, `i` is \( n - 3 \).

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - Since `i` is currently \( n - 3 \), for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be \( n - 4 \).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except `ans[n-2]` which is `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`, `i` must be n - 4**
