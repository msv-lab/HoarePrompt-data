Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is calculated as follows: `ans[0]` is `ans[1] - arr[0]`, `ans[1]` is `ans[2] - arr[1]`, and so on until `ans[n-2]` which is `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`, `i` is -1.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `ans` list will have its first element updated based on the value of `arr[0]`, the second element based on `arr[1]`, and so forth, until the last but one element (`ans[n-2]`) which is updated based on `arr[n-2]`. The last element of `ans` remains unchanged at \(10^9\). The variable `i` will be set to -1 after the loop terminates.
