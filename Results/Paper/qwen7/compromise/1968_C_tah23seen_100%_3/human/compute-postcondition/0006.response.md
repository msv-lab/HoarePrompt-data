Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except `ans[n-2]` which is `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`, `i` is n - 4, `ans[i]` is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Given that `i` is `n - 4`, `ans[i]` becomes `ans[n - 3] - arr[n - 4]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
