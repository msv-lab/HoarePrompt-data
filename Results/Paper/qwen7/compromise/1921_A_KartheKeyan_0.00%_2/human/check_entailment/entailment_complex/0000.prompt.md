Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

    #State: Output State: `n` is 0, `x` is an input integer from the last iteration's third split, `y` is an input integer from the last iteration's third split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples of input integers sorted in ascending order, `p2` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the last and second-to-last points in `coord`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `p1` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in `coord`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be reduced to 0. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values from the last set of inputs provided. The list `coord` will contain four tuples representing the sorted coordinates of the corners of the last square input, and `res` will be the result calculated based on these coordinates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to four sets of coordinates representing the corners of squares. For each set, it calculates the area of the square formed by these coordinates and prints the result. After processing all sets, it outputs the final calculated area and ensures that the loop counter `n` is reduced to 0. The function does not return any value but modifies variables like `coord`, `p1`, `p2`, and `res` to reflect the last processed square's properties.
