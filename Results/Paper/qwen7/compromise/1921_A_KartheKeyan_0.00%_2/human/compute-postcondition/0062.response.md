Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `y` is an input integer.
   - `coord` is a list containing tuples of 4 input integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `p2` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the third and second points in `coord`.
   - `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   - `p1` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in `coord`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(res)
   ```

To determine what will be printed, we need to figure out the values of `p1` and `p2`, and then calculate `res`.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **`p1` Calculation:**
   - `coord` is a list of tuples, each containing 4 input integers sorted in ascending order.
   - Let's denote the coordinates in `coord` as `(a1, b1, c1, d1)`, `(a2, b2, c2, d2)`, ..., where `a1 < b1 < c1 < d1` and so on.
   - `p1` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in `coord`.
     - If `coord` is `[ (a1, b1, c1, d1), (a2, b2, c2, d2), ... ]`, then `p1 = a2 - a1`.

2. **`p2` Calculation:**
   - `p2` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the third and second points in `coord`.
     - If `coord` is `[ (a1, b1, c1, d1), (a2, b2, c2, d2), ... ]`, then `p2 = (c2 - b2)^2`.

3. **`res` Calculation:**
   - `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
     - `res = abs(sqrt(p1) * sqrt(p2)) = abs(sqrt((a2 - a1) * (c2 - b2)^2)) = abs((c2 - b2) * sqrt(a2 - a1))`.

### Final Output:

Given the above calculations, the print statement will output the value of `res`.

Output: **abs((c2 - b2) * sqrt(a2 - a1))**
