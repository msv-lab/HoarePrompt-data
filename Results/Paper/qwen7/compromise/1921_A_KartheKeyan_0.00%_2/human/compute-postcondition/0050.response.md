Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing the tuple (`x`, `y`), `p2` is `x - y`, `res` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. It does not affect the values of `i`, `coord`, `p2`, or `res`. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `x` and `y` are updated to the input integers, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `p2` is `x - y`, and `res` remains 0.
