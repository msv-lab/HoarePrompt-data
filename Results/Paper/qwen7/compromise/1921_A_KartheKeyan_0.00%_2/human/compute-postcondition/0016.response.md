Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split, `y` is an input integer from the third split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: (1, an input integer), (an input integer, an input integer), (an input integer, an input integer), and (3, 3) sorted by their tuple values.**

Explanation: The `sorted()` function sorts the `coord` list based on the tuple values. Since the original `coord` list contains tuples with the last one being (3, 3), and the first three tuples are (1, an input integer), (an input integer, input integer), and (an input integer, input integer), the sorted list will maintain the order of the first three tuples followed by (3, 3) because it is the only tuple with both elements being 3.
