Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing tuples of 4 input integers sorted in ascending order, `p2` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the third and second points in `coord`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `p1` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in `coord`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `res` as the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. Since `p1` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in `coord`, and `p2` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the third and second points in `coord`, `res` is computed using these values. The other variables remain unchanged.
