Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is 0, `res` is 0, `n` is 1, `i` must be less than 4**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The values of `i`, `coord`, `p2`, `res`, and `n` remain unchanged. The condition that `i` must be less than 4 also remains valid.
