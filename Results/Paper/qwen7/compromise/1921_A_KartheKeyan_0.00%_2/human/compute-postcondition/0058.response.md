Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing tuples of 4 input integers sorted in ascending order, `p2` is `x - y`, `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `coord = sorted(coord)` sorts the list `coord` in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple. Since the initial state of `coord` contains tuples of 4 input integers, after sorting, `coord` will contain these tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `p2`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
