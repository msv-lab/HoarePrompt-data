Output State: `i` is 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('4', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('x', 'y'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is 0, `res` is 0, `n` is 1.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations (4 times), `i` will be 4, `x` and `y` will be the last input integers provided by the user, `coord` will be a list of 4 tuples each containing an input integer pair, `p2` remains 0, `res` remains 0, and `n` remains 1.
