Postcondition: `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z'. If `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then the current value of `chr(c)` is added to `decoded`. If `chr(c)` is in `mapping.values()`, the loop or statement is broken.
