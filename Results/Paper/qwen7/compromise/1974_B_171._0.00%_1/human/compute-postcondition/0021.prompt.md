Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `char` is a character, and `mapping` does not contain the character `char`
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is 97. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, then `mapping` has one more entry.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is 98, and if `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `c` is 99. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of the dictionary `mapping`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the only case considered is when `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
