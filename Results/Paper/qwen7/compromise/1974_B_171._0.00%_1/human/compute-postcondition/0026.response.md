Output State: **`char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, `c` is 122, `char` remains unchanged from its initial value**.

Explanation: The code appends the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping` to the list `decoded`. Since `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` remains unchanged (though in this case it changes), the updated state includes this new element. The value of `c` is 122 and does not change, and `char` remains unchanged from its initial value.
