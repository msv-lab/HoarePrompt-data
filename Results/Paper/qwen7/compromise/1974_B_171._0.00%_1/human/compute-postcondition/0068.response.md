Output State: The `decoded` list contains all lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z' exactly once, followed by an additional 'z'. The `mapping` dictionary maps each lowercase English letter from 'a' to 'z' to the last unique character processed in the `encoded` string during the loop's final iteration. If any character in `encoded` was encountered multiple times, it would be mapped to the last occurrence. The variable `c` retains its value of 122 (the ASCII value for 'z').

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `decoded` list will contain every lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z' exactly once, plus an extra 'z'. The `mapping` dictionary will map each letter from 'a' to 'z' to the last character from `encoded` that wasn't already mapped to another letter, ensuring no duplicates. The variable `c` will still be 122, representing the ASCII value of 'z'.
