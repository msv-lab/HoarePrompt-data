Output State: **`char` is in `mapping`; `decoded` is a list where it has one more element than before, and the last element is the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`.**

Explanation: The code appends the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping` to the list `decoded`. Since `char` is a character and `mapping` is a collection where keys are characters, `decoded.append(mapping[char])` adds the decoded value (which is the value associated with `char` in `mapping`) to the end of the list `decoded`. The initial state of `char` being in `mapping` remains unchanged, and the length of `decoded` increases by one.
