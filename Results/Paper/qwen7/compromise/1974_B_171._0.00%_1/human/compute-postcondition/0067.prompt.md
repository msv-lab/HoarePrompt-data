Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `decoded` is an empty list; `mapping` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for char in encoded:
    if char in mapping:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    else:
        for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
            if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                mapping[chr(c)] = char
                break
        decoded.append(chr(c))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `char` is a character, `decoded` is a list where it either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` remains unchanged. Additionally, `c` is set to 122 (ord('z')), `char` remains unchanged from its initial value, and the dictionary `mapping` will map each character from 'a' to 'z' to the initial value of `char`, unless a character's corresponding ASCII value ('a' to 'z') is already a value in `mapping`, in which case the loop will break without adding that key-value pair.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z', `c` is 122, and `char` remains unchanged from its initial value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and an additional 'z'. If `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` has an additional element which is the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`. Otherwise, `decoded` remains unchanged with each character having its corresponding decoded value in `mapping`, and `c` is 122, which is the ASCII value for 'z'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
