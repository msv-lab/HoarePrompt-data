Output State: `decoded` is a list containing all lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z' exactly once, followed by an additional 'z'. The dictionary `mapping` maps each letter from 'a' to 'z' to the last unique character processed in the `encoded` string, and `char` is the last character of the `encoded` string that was processed. Variable `c` is 122, which is the ASCII value for 'z'.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `decoded` will contain every lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z' exactly once, plus an extra 'z'. The `mapping` dictionary will map each letter from 'a' to 'z' to the last unique character in the `encoded` string that was processed. The variable `char` will hold the last character of the `encoded` string that was processed during the loop, and `c` will be set to 122, the ASCII value for 'z'.
