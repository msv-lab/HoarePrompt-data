Output State: **The program returns "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzz"**

Explanation: The `decoded` list initially contains all lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z' exactly once, followed by an additional 'z'. The `return` statement joins all elements of the `decoded` list into a single string. Therefore, the resulting string is "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzz".
