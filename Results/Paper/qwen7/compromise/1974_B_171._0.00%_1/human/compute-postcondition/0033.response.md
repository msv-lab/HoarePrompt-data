Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `c` which is iterating over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `c` must be within the range 97 to 123 (inclusive).
   - `char` is the next character in `encoded`.
   - `decoded` remains unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `c` is iterating through the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`, the value of `c` will increment by 1 for each iteration.
   - Therefore, if `c` was in the range 97 to 123 (inclusive) at the end of the previous iteration, it will now be the next value in the range.
   - The value of `char` will be the next character in the `encoded` string.
   - The value of `decoded` will remain unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `c` will now be the next value in the range 97 to 123 (inclusive).
   - `char` will be the next character in the `encoded` string.
   - `decoded` will remain unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`c` must be within the range 98 to 124 (inclusive), `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `decoded` remains unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`**.
