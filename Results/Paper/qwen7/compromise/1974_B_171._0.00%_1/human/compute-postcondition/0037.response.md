Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `c` as it iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `c` is within the specified range.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` must be within the range 98 to 124 (inclusive).
   - `char` is the next character in `encoded`.
   - `decoded` remains unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`.

4. **Consider the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the given conditions, if `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then `mapping[chr(c)]` is set to `char` and the loop breaks.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `c` is within the range, and there is no condition in the loop body that changes `c` directly, `c` will increment to the next value in the range.
   - `char` and `decoded` remain unchanged unless the specific condition in the loop body is met, but since we are considering the next iteration, these values stay the same.

6. **Calculate the new value of `c`**:
   - The current range is from 98 to 124.
   - The next value of `c` would be the next character in the ASCII range from 'a' to 'z'.
   - The next character in this range is `ord('b')`, which is 98.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`c` must be within the range 99 to 124 (inclusive), `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `decoded` remains unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`**.
