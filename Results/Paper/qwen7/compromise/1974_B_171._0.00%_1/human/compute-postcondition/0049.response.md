Output State: **`char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z', `c` is 98, and the current value of `chr(c)` is in `mapping.values()`**.

Explanation: The code `mapping[chr(c)] = char` assigns the character `char` to the key `chr(c)` in the dictionary `mapping`. Given the initial state, `c` was 97, so `chr(c)` was 'a'. After executing the code, `c` is incremented to 98, making `chr(c)` now 'b'. Since `chr(c)` is no longer 'a', it means that 'a' was already in `mapping.values()`, and now 'b' is added to `mapping`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
