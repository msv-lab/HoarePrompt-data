Output State: **`c` is 98, `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `c`, `char`, or `decoded`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific changes are made to these variables within the given code snippet, their previous states remain unchanged.
