Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `c` and `char`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `ord('a')` to `ord('z') + 1`. This means `c` takes values from 97 to 123 (inclusive).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is 98
   - `char` is the next character in `encoded`
   - If `chr(97)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then `decoded` is updated to include the decoded value corresponding to `char`.
   - If `chr(98)` is already in `mapping.values()`, then `decoded` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the next value of `c`**: Since `c` starts from 97 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `c` would be 99.

5. **Determine the next value of `char`**: `char` is the next character in `encoded`. Since `c` was 98, `char` would be the next character in the `encoded` string.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `c` will be incremented to 99.
   - `char` will be the next character in `encoded`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`c` is 99, `char` is the next character in `encoded`**.
