#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    mapping = {}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            decoded.append(mapping[char])
        else:
            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char

    #State: Output State: The `decoded` list contains all lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z' exactly once, followed by an additional 'z'. The `mapping` dictionary maps each lowercase English letter from 'a' to 'z' to the last unique character processed in the `encoded` string during the loop's final iteration. If any character in `encoded` was encountered multiple times, it would be mapped to the last occurrence. The variable `c` retains its value of 122 (the ASCII value for 'z').
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `decoded` list will contain every lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z' exactly once, plus an extra 'z'. The `mapping` dictionary will map each letter from 'a' to 'z' to the last character from `encoded` that wasn't already mapped to another letter, ensuring no duplicates. The variable `c` will still be 122, representing the ASCII value of 'z'.
    return ''.join(decoded)
    #The program returns "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzz"
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a specific string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzz". It decodes the input string according to a custom mapping rule where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', ensuring each letter appears exactly once in the output. If a character repeats in `encoded`, it is mapped to the last occurrence. After processing, the function appends an extra 'z' to the decoded string.
