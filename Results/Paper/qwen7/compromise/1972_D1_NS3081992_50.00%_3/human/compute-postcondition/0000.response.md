Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and n + m <= 4 * 10^6, and they have been reassigned to the values returned by `func_7()`**.

This means that the function `func_7()` has returned new values for `n` and `m`, which are still positive integers within the specified range, and their sum is still less than or equal to 4 * 10^6.
