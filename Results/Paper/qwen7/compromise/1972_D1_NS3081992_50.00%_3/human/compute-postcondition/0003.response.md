Let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and the initial state step by step:

### Given:
- The loop condition: `i * i <= n + i`
- Initial state:
  - `i` is 1
  - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(n + m \leq 4 \times 10^6\)
  - `n` and `m` have been reassigned to the values returned by `func_7()`
  - `ans` is 0 (this state does not affect the loop condition)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is initially set to 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i * i <= n + i`.

3. **Substitute `i = 1` into the Loop Condition:**
   - When `i = 1`, the condition becomes \(1 * 1 \leq n + 1\), which simplifies to \(1 \leq n + 1\).

4. **Simplify the Condition:**
   - The simplified condition is \(1 \leq n + 1\), which further simplifies to \(0 \leq n\).

5. **Check the Constraints on `n`:**
   - From the problem statement, we know that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^6\). This means `n` is always non-negative and within the specified range.

Given that `n` is a positive integer and the loop condition \(1 \leq n + 1\) is always true for any positive integer `n`, no adjustment is necessary for `n` to satisfy the loop condition.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop condition \(i * i \leq n + i\) is satisfied with the initial value of `i` being 1 and the constraints on `n` ensuring the condition holds, no adjustments are needed.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\) and \(n + m \leq 4 \times 10^6\), and they have been reassigned to the values returned by `func_7()`**
