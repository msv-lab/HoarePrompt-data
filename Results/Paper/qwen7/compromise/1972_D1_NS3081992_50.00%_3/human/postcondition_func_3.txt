The function accepts a positive integer `rows_number` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls another function `func_3()` with two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6), and collects the results in a list. After processing all test cases, it returns a list containing `rows_number` results.
