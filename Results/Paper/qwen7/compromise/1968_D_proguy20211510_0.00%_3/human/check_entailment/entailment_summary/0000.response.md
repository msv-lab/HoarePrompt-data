Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. It handles the special case where both players start on the index corresponding to the maximum value in the array \(a\), which results in a draw.
3. The logic for determining the winner involves calculating scores for both players over \(k\) rounds, considering the maximum value in \(a\) and the permutation \(p\).
4. The program updates the positions of both players based on the permutation \(p\) and adds the corresponding values from the array \(a\) to their scores.
5. After processing all rounds, it compares the final scores of Sasha and Bodya and prints the appropriate result.

Given the detailed explanation and the execution summary, the program seems to follow the correct logic for determining the winner based on the rules provided.

Correctness: **True**
