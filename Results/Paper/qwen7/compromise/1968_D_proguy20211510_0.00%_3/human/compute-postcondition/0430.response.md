Output State: `preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb + b[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(b)-1`, `pres` is a list containing the sum of `ss + s[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `sb` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `s`, `s` is a non-empty list, `len(s)` is greater than 0.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `preb` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements of `b` up to each index, `pres` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements of `s` up to each index, `sb` will be the total sum of all elements in `b`, and `ss` will be the total sum of all elements in `s`.
