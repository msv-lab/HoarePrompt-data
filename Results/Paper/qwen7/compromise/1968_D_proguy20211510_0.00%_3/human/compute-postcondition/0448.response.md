Output State: **`rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `i` is `len(pres)`, `ptsb` is the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` is the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pres) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)` calculates the maximum values from the lists `ptss` and `ptsb` and assigns them to `maxs` and `maxb` respectively. The values of `rem`, `i`, `ptsb`, and `ptss` remain unchanged from their previous states.
