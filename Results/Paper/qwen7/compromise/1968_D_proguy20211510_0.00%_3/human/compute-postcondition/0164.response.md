Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(pres)`, meaning `i` is the length of the list `pres`.
- `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, where `k` is some integer.
- `ptsb` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]` for each `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`.
- `ptss` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + (k - i - 1) * s[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
- It is also given that `maxs` is greater than or equal to `maxb`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
