Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(s))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(s)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `preb` is a list containing the value `sb + b[i]`.
   - `pres` is a list containing the value `ss + s[i]`.
   - `sb` is `sb + b[i]`.
   - `ss` is `ss + s[i]`.
   - `s` is a non-empty list.
   - `len(s)` is greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < len(s)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value less than `len(s)`, and `len(s)` remained unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was less than `len(s)` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i = i + 1`).
   - `len(s)` remains the same as it did not change within the loop body.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `preb` and `pres` are updated lists based on the previous values and the current value of `i`.
   - `sb` and `ss` are updated based on the previous values and the current value of `i`.
   - `s` remains a non-empty list.
   - `len(s)` remains greater than 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `preb` is a list containing the value `sb + b[i+1]`.
- `pres` is a list containing the value `ss + s[i+1]`.
- `sb` is `sb + b[i+1]`.
- `ss` is `ss + s[i+1]`.
- `s` is a non-empty list.
- `len(s)` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `preb` is a list containing the value `sb + b[i+1]`, `pres` is a list containing the value `ss + s[i+1]`, `sb` is `sb + b[i+1]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i+1]`, `s` is a non-empty list, `len(s)` is greater than 0.**
