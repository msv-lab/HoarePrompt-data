Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains the element `(k - 1) * maxa` plus `a[pb - 1]`, `s` contains the element `(k - 2) * maxa`, and either `foundb` is False or `founds` is False, and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Since `b` previously contained the element `(k - 1) * maxa`, after appending `a[pb - 1]`, `b` now contains the element `(k - 1) * maxa + a[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
