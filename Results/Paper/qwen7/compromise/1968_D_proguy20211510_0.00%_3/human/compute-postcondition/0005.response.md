Output State: **`n` is an integer value of the original `n` string, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `pb` is an integer value of the original `pb` string, `ps` is an integer value of the original `ps` string**.

The code converts the strings `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` into integers and assigns them back to the same variable names. Therefore, the values of these variables are now integers rather than strings.
