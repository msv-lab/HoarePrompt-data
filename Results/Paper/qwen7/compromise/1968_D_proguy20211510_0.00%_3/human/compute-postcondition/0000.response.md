Output State: **t is a positive integer, n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers, p is a permutation of length n, a is an array of positive integers, YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO'**.

The code defines two constants `YES` and `NO` with the respective string values 'YES' and 'NO'. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
