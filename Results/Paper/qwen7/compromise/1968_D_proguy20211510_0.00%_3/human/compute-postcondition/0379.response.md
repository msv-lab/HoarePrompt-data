Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise it can be either True or False, `b` now contains the value `b + [maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa]` or `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]]`, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` now contains `s + [maxa]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`.**

This means that the variable `s` has had its last value appended with `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
