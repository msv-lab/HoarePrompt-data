Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 8`, `sb` is the concatenation of `sb` and `b[i-4]`, `pres` is appended with the value of `ss + s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `pres.append(ss + s[i])` appends the value of `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. The variables `i` and `sb` are updated according to their previous definitions (`i` is `i_prev + 4` and `sb` is the concatenation of `sb` and `b[i]`). Since `i` was previously `i_prev + 4`, now it becomes `i_prev + 8`. The value of `sb` is updated to include `b[i-4]` (since `i` was `i_prev + 4`, `i-4` is `i_prev`). The list `pres` is modified by appending `ss + s[i]`.
