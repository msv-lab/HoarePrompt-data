Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 9`, `sb` is the concatenation of `sb` and `b[i-4]`, `pres` is appended with the value of `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is updated to `ss + s[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by appending `s[i]` to it. Since `i` was previously `i_prev + 8`, it is now `i_prev + 9`. The other variables (`sb` and `pres`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
