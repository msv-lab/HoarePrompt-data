Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains the element `(k - (0 + 1)) * maxa`, and both `foundb` and `founds` are True.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `b`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `(i + 1)` is 1. Therefore, the value appended to `b` is `(k - 1) * maxa`. The values of `k`, `maxa`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged, and `i` is updated to 1.
