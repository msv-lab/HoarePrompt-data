Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` contains the value `maxa`, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, and `maxa` remains unchanged; `s` is a list containing the element `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code appends `maxa` to the list `s`. Since `maxa` is equal to `a[pb - 1]`, the list `s` now contains this value. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
