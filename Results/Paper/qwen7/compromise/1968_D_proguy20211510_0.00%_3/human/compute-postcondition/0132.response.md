Output State: **`preb` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `sb + b[i+1] + b[i]` and the second element is `sb + b[i]`; `pres` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `ss + s[i+1]` and the second element is `ss + s[i+1] + s[i]`; `sb` is `sb + b[i+1] + b[i]`; `ss` is `ss + s[i+1] + s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by the value of `s[i]`. Since `sb` and `preb`, `pres` are not directly affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, `sb` becomes `sb + b[i+1] + b[i]` (unchanged), `ss` becomes `ss + s[i] + s[i]` (which simplifies to `ss + s[i+1] + s[i]`), and the lists `preb` and `pres` retain their original structure with updated values for `ss`.
