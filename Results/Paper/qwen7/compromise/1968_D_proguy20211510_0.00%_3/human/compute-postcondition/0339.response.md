Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` can be either True or False, and the current value of `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.**

Explanation: The line `foundb = True` sets the variable `foundb` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
