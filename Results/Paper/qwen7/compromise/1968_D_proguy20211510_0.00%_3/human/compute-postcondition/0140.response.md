Output State: **`preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb + b[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`, `pres` is a list containing the sum of `ss + s[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`, `sb` is equal to `sb + b[i]` where `i` is the last index of `s`, and `ss` is equal to `ss + s[i]` where `i` is the last index of `s`, `ptsb` is an empty list, and `ptss` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `ptsb` and `ptss`. This does not affect the values of `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, and `ss`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
