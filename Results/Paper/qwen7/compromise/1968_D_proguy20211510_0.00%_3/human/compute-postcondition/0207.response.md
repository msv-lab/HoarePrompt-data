Postcondition: `founds` is `True`, `foundb` is `True`, `i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.

This means that after executing the if-else block, `founds` and `foundb` remain `True`. The variable `i` remains as the length of `pres`. The variable `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged. The list `p` is obtained from input, and the list `a` is obtained from input.split(). The variable `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. The list `b` contains two elements: the first is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and the second element is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]` depending on whether `foundb` is true or false. The list `s` contains one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.
