Postcondition: **`founds` and `foundb` remain `True`, `i` is `length_of_pres + 2`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 2`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing either three or four elements with the last element being `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `foundb` is true, `b` has an additional element which is `maxa`. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `b` has the additional element `a[pb - 1]`. Otherwise, `b` has the new element `p[pb - 1]` appended.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. It ensures that the variables retain their initial conditions as specified in the precondition, and the list `b` is updated according to the conditions within the if and else parts.
