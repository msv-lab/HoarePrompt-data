Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise it can be either True or False, `b` now contains the value `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]], `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` contains the value `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `s` contains `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`; `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`**.

Explanation: The line `pb = p[pb - 1]` updates the value of `pb` to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain in their previous states as described in the initial state.
