Output State: **`i` is 0; `rem` is `k - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initially set to 0. The code calculates `rem` as `k - (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, `rem` becomes `k - (0 + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 1`. The value of `k` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the value of `i` remains 0.
