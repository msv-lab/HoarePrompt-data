Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 2; `k` is greater than `i + 1`; `b` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`; `s` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `s`. Since `i` is either 4 or 2, and `k` is greater than `i + 1`, the value of `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` will be different depending on the value of `i`. However, the exact value of `maxa` is not specified, so we keep it as part of the expression. The list `b` remains unchanged, and `s` now contains the calculated value.
