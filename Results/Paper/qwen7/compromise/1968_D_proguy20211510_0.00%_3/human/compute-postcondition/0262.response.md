Output State: **`preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True, `i` is `k`, `rem` is 0, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing `k` elements, each of which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `s` is a list containing `k` elements, each of which is `maxa` if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1]` otherwise, with `ps` updated accordingly during the loop iterations; `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `sb` and `ss` to 0. It does not affect any of the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the values of all the other variables remain the same as in the initial state, and the new variables `sb` and `ss` are initialized to 0.
