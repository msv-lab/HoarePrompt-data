Output State: **`preb` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `sb + b[i+1]` and the second element is `sb + b[i]`; `pres` is a list containing one element which is `ss + s[i+1]`; `sb` is `sb + b[i+1]`; `ss` is `ss + s[i+1]`; `s` must be a non-empty list and `i` must be less than the length of `s`.**

This means that the list `preb` now contains two elements: the first element remains as `sb + b[i+1]` from the initial state, and the second element is updated to `sb + b[i]`. The lists `pres`, `sb`, and `ss` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the conditions on `s` and `i` still hold true.
