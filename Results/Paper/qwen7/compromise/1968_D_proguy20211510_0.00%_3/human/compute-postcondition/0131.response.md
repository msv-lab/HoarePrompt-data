Output State: **`preb` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `sb + b[i+1] + b[i]` and the second element is `sb + b[i]`; `pres` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `ss + s[i+1]` and the second element is `ss + s[i+1] + s[i]`; `sb` is `sb + b[i+1] + b[i]`; `ss` is `ss + s[i+1]`;**

Explanation: The code appends `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`. Initially, `pres` contains one element `ss + s[i+1]`. After appending, `pres` now contains two elements: `ss + s[i+1]` and `ss + s[i]`. The values of `sb` and `ss` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
