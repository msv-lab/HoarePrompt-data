The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state. The variables `i`, `rem`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, and `maxa` retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**
