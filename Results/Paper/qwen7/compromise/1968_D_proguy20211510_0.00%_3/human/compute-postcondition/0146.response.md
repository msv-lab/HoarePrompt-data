Output State: **`i` is 3, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rem` to `k - (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 3, `rem` is updated to `k - 3 - 1`, which simplifies to `k - i - 1`. The values of `ptsb` and `ptss` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
