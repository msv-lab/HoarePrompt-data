Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `founds` and `foundb` remain `True`. `i` remains as the length of `pres`. `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged. `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input.split()`. `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. `b` is a list containing two elements: the first is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and the second element is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]` depending on whether `foundb` is true or false. `s` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is either `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]` after being updated.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `founds` and `foundb` remain `True`, `i` is `length_of_pres + 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 2`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing either three or four elements depending on whether `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa` and the third element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is a list containing three or four elements with the last element being `maxa` if `a[pb - 1] == maxa` or `a[ps - 1]` otherwise, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `founds` and `foundb` remain `True`, `i` is `length_of_pres + 2`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 2`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing either three or four elements with the last element being `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `foundb` is true, `b` has an additional element which is `maxa`. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `b` has the additional element `a[pb - 1]`. Otherwise, `b` has the new element `p[pb - 1]` appended.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
