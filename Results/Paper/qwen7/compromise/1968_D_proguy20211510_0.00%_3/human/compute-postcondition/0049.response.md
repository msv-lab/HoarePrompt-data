Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` is `(k - 1) * maxa + a[pb - 1]`, `s` is `(k - 2) * maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, and either `foundb` is False or `founds` is False, and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pb` to `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
