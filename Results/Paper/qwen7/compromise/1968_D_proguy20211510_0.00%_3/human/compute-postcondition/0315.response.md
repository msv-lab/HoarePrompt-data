Output: **Bodya**

Explanation: The print statement `print('Bodya')` directly outputs the string `'Bodya'`. None of the other variables or objects mentioned in the initial state affect this print statement because it does not reference any of them. The values of `i`, `rem`, `pb`, `ps`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `p`, `a`, and `maxa` are not used in the print statement, so they do not influence the output.
