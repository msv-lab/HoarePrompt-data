Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(pres)`, `rem` is 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is not yet calculated, `ptss` is not yet calculated, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split()**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an int using `map(int, ...)`, and then converts the map object to a list. The resulting list `a` is assigned to the variable `a`. The other variables (`i`, `rem`, `pb`, `ps`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`, and `p`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
