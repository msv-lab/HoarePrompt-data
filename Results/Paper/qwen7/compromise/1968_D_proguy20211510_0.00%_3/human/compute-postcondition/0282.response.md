Output State: **`i` is 1; `rem` is `k - 1`; `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` to the list `ptsb`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `rem` is `k - 1`, the value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The value appended to `ptsb` is `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`. The values of `preb`, `b`, and `k` remain unchanged.
