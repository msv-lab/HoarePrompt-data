Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` and `founds` are True, `b` contains an additional element which is ((`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`), `s` contains an additional element which is ((`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`).**

Explanation: The code appends the value of ((`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`) to the list `s`. Since `i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` and `founds` are True, and `b` contains an additional element which is ((`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`), these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `s` now includes the newly appended element.
