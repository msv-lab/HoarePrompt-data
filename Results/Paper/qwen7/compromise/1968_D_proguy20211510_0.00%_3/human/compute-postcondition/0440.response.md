Output State: **`rem` is `k - i - 1`, `i` is 3, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0] + preb[3] + (k - i - 1) * b[3]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptsb`. The new value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, which translates to `preb[3] + (k - i - 1) * b[3]` given the current values of `i` and `rem`. The other variables remain unchanged.
