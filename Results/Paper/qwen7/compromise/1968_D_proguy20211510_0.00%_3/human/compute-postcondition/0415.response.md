Output State: **`preb` is a list containing the value `sb + b[i]`, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is `sb + b[i]`, `ss` is 0, `s` is a non-empty list, `len(s)` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` increments the value of `sb` by `b[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `sb` now holds the value of its previous value plus `b[i]`. The list `preb` still contains the value `sb + b[i]`, and `pres` remains an empty list since no elements were added to it. The values of `ss`, `s`, and `len(s)` remain as they were in the initial state.
