Output State: **`i` is either 4 or 2; `k` is greater than `i + 1`; `b` is a list with elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]` depending on whether `foundb` is true or false; `s` is a list with elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[ps - 1]`; `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`; `foundb` is True if `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, otherwise `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.**

Explanation: The line `ps = p[ps - 1]` updates the value of `ps` to the value of `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
