Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` now contains the value `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]]` or `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]]`, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` contains the value `a[ps - 1]` appended to itself, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[ps - 1]` to `s`. Since `s` was previously containing `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `s` contains `a[ps - 1]`, appending `a[ps - 1]` to `s` means `s` now contains `a[ps - 1]` twice. If `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, `s` becomes `maxa, maxa`; otherwise, `s` becomes `a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
