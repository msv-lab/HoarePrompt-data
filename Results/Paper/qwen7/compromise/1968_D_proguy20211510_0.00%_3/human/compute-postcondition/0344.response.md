Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is False, `founds` can be either True or False, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, and `maxa` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `pb = p[pb - 1]` updates the value of `pb` to be the value at the index `p[pb - 1]` in the list `p`. All other variables remain in their initial or previously stated states.
