Postcondition: **`founds` and `foundb` remain `True`. `i` remains as the length of `pres`. `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged. `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input.split()`. `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. `b` is a list containing two elements: the first is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and the second element is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]` depending on whether `foundb` is true or false. `s` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is either `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]` after being updated.**
