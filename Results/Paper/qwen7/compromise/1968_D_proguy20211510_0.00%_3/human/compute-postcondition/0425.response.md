Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(s)`. These are the variables that determine whether the loop can continue executing.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `preb` is a list containing the values `sb + b[i] + b[i-1]` and `sb + b[i] + b[i-1] + b[i-1]`.
   - `sb` is `sb + b[i]`.
   - `ss` is `ss + s[i] + s[i-1]`.
   - `s` is a non-empty list, and `len(s)` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `i_prev + 2`.
   - `pres` is a list containing one additional element `ss + s[i]`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(s)`.
   - Since `i` is currently `i_prev + 2`, the next value of `i` would be `i_prev + 3`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `i_prev + 3` must be less than `len(s)`, which means `len(s)` must be greater than `i_prev + 3`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (`i_prev + 2`) to `i_prev + 3`.
   - `len(s)` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the length of the list `s` does not change within the loop body (based on the information given).

5. **Construct the New State**:
   - `preb` will contain new values based on the updated `i` and `sb`, but these changes are not specified in the loop head.
   - `sb` will be updated to `sb + b[i_prev + 3]`.
   - `ss` will be updated to `ss + s[i_prev + 3] + s[i_prev + 2]`.
   - `pres` will contain an additional element `ss + s[i_prev + 3]`.

However, since the task is to adjust only the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `len(s)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `i_prev + 3`, `len(s)` must be greater than `i_prev + 3`**
