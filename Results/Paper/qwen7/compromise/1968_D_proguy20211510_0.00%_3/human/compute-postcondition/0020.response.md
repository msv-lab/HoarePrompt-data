Postcondition: `n` is an integer value of the original `n` string, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `pb` is an integer value of the original `pb` string, `ps` is an integer value of the original `ps` string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `p`. Additionally, `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `a[ps - 1]`, both `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are not equal to `maxa`, and the current value of `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.
