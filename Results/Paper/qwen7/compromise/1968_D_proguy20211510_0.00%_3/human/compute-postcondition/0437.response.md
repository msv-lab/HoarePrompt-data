Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(pres))`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `rem` is `k - 1`
   - `i` is 2
   - `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`
   - `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < len(pres)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 2, and the loop will increment `i` by 1 each time it iterates, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(pres)`. Therefore, `i` should be set to 3.
   - The values of `rem`, `ptsb`, and `ptss` do not change within the loop head, so they remain the same.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `rem` remains `k - 1`
   - `i` is now 3
   - `ptsb` remains `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`
   - `ptss` remains `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `rem` is `k - 1`, `i` is 3, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`**
