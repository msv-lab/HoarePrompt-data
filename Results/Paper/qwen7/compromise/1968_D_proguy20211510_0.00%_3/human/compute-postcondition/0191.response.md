Output State: **`founds` is `True`, `foundb` is `True`, `i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is an empty list, `len(pres)` must be less than `k`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is `len(pres)`, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and the other variables remain unchanged, the list `b` now contains one element, which is the calculated value.
