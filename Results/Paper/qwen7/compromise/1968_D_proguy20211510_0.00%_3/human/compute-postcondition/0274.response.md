Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` and `i` must be less than `len(s)`; `preb` includes the appended value `sb + b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and it must still be less than the length of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
