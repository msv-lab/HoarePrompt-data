Postcondition: `n` is an integer value of the original `n` string, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `pb` is an integer value of the original `pb` string, `ps` is an integer value of the original `ps` string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `p`. The last elements of the lists indexed by `pb-1` and `ps-1` are equal to the maximum value in the list `p`.
