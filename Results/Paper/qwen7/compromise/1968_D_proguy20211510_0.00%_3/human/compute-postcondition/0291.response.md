Output State: **`i` is 4, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[4] + rem * b[4] + preb[4] + rem * b[4]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`, and `ptss` now includes an additional element `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ptss`. The new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4, so the new element added to `ptss` is `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
