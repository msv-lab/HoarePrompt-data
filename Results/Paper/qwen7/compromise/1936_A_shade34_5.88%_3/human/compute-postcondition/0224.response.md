Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n + 2`, where `n` is at least 2.
   - `s` is a new string input by the user.
   - `mak` is `i`.
   - `pans` is a list containing the value `i` appended to itself if `s` equals '=', otherwise `pans` contains the value `i`.

2. **Values of Variables:**
   - Since `n` is at least 2, let's assume the smallest possible value for `n`, which is 2. Therefore, `i = n + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.
   - `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, so `mak = 4`.
   - `pans` will be a list. If `s` equals '=', then `pans` will contain `i` twice, i.e., `[4, 4]`. Otherwise, it will contain just `[4]`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`.
   - We need to determine the value of `mak2`. Since `mak2` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is the same as `mak`, which is 4.

4. **Final Values:**
   - `i` is 4.
   - `mak` is 4.
   - `mak2` is 4.
   - The value of `pans` depends on `s`, but since we don't know `s`, we consider both possibilities:
     - If `s = '='`, then `pans = [4, 4]`.
     - Otherwise, `pans = [4]`.

Given the print statement and the values derived from the initial state, the output will be one of the following two cases:

- If `s = '='`, the output will be: `? 4 4 4 4`.
- If `s â‰  '='`, the output will be: `? 4 4 4 4`.

Since the exact value of `s` is not specified, we consider the general case where `s` could be either '=' or not '='. However, the values of `mak` and `mak2` are always 4, and `i` is also 4.

Output: **? 4 4 4 4**
