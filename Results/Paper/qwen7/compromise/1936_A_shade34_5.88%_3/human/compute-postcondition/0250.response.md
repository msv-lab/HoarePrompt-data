Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `i` is 3.
2. `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive.
3. `mak` remains unchanged, but its value is not explicitly given in the initial state. Since it's not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know it must be an index within the bounds of the `pans` list.

Given these points, let's break down the print statement:

- `pans[mak]`: This will print the element at the index `mak` in the list `pans`.
- `pans[mak]`: This will print the same element again.
- `pans[i]`: Since `i` is 3, this will print the element at index 3 in the list `pans`.
- `pans[i]`: This will print the same element again.

Since `pans` contains all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive, the element at index 3 (which is `i`) would be `n + 2`.

Therefore, the print statement will output two identical elements from the list `pans` at index `mak` and one specific element at index 3, which is `n + 2`.

Output: **pans[mak], pans[mak], n + 2 (where `mak` is an index within the bounds of `pans` and `n` is the starting number of the list `pans`)**
