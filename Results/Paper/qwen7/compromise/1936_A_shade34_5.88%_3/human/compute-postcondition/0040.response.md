Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a string input from the user.
   - If `s` is `<`, then `mak` is equal to `i` and `pans` is `[i]`.
   - If `s` is `=`, then `pans` contains the value `i`.
   - Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged and `pans` retains its original value.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `n`, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `n`.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but it is not mentioned that `n` changes, so we assume `n` stays the same.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `k`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same as before the previous iteration.

Since the exact values of `s`, `mak`, and `pans` are not specified at the end of the previous iteration, we cannot provide specific values for these variables. However, we know that the loop will continue if `i < n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`s` is a string input from the user, `mak` is undefined, `pans` is undefined, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same as before the previous iteration**.

If we had specific values for `s`, `mak`, and `pans` at the end of the previous iteration, we would include those in the state description.
