Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0, `i` is 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means any buffered data is immediately written to the terminal or file. Since no variables are assigned or modified by this line of code, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
