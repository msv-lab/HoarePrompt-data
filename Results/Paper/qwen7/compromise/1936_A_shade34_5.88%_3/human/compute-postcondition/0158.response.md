Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `pans`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(pans) - 1`. This means `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is `n-1`
   - `mak2` is `n-1`
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `pans` must have at least 2 elements
   - The input string is `'>',` (which means no changes are made to the variables)

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`.
   - `pans` must still have at least 2 elements.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `pans` must have at least 2 elements**
