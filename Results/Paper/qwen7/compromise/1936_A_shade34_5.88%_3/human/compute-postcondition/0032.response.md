Output State: **`mak` is equal to `i`, `s` is a string input from the user and its value is '<', `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. However, since the initial value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `mak`. The string `s` remains unchanged with its value being '<'. The function `sys.stdout.flush()` is also not affected by this assignment.
