Output State: **`s` is a new string input from the user, `mak` is undefined, `pans` is a list containing the values `k + 1` and `i`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is the same as before the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given that `pans` initially contained the value `k + 1` and `i` is equal to `k + 1`, after appending, `pans` will contain both `k + 1` and `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
