Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because `range(1, n)` generates numbers starting from 1 up to but not including `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `mak` is 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - The input string is less than '<'.

4. **Determine the Next Values**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2. For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still needs to be greater than 2.
   - `t` remains at least 1.
   - `mak` remains 2.
   - The condition about the input string being less than '<' remains unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

**State: `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `mak` is 2, `i` is 3, if the input string is less than '<'.**
