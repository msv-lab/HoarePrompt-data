Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a new string input from the user.
- `mak` is undefined.
- `pans` is a list containing the value `k + 1`.
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `n` is the same as before the previous iteration.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

1. `'?'`: This is a literal string and will be printed as is.
2. `mak`: This variable is undefined, so it will be printed as `None`.
3. `mak2`: This variable is also undefined, so it will be printed as `None`.
4. `i`: According to the initial state, `i` is `k + 1`. Since `k` is not explicitly defined, we can only say that `i` is `k + 1`.
5. `mak2`: Again, this variable is undefined, so it will be printed as `None`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? None None k + 1 None'**
