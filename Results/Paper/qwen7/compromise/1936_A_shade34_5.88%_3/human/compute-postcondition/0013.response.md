Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `mak` is 1, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending buffered data is written to the console. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `mak`, and `i` remain unchanged.
