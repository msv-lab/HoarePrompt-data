Output State: **`mak2` is 3, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is equal to `n-1', and `pans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `pans`. The values of `mak2`, `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables along with the newly created empty list `pans`.
