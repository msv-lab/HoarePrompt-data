Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`, where `n` is at least 2.
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - `mak` is `i` if `s` equals '<', otherwise `mak` is the same as before.
   - `pans` is a list containing the value `i` if `s` equals '<', otherwise `pans` is a list with the value `i` appended to it.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `n + 1` and since `n` is at least 2, `i` must be at least 3.
- `mak` is determined by the value of `s`. If `s == '<'`, then `mak = i`. Otherwise, `mak` retains its previous value.
- `pans` is a list that contains `i` if `s == '<'`, otherwise it appends `i` to the existing list. However, the value of `mak2` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we need to infer it from the context. Since `mak2` is not defined elsewhere in the initial state, it is likely that `mak2` refers to the same value as `mak`.

Given these points, let's consider the possible scenarios for `s`:

### Scenario 1: `s == '<'`
- `mak` would be `i` because `mak` is set to `i` if `s` equals '<'.
- `pans` would contain `i` because `pans` is updated to include `i` if `s == '<'`.
- `mak2` would also be `i` because it is assumed to be the same as `mak`.

### Scenario 2: `s != '<'`
- `mak` would retain its previous value (which is `i`).
- `pans` would append `i` to itself, but since `mak2` is not defined, it is likely to be the same as `mak`.
- Therefore, `mak2` would be `i`.

In both scenarios, `mak2` is `i`.

Thus, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a literal string)
- `mak` (which is `i`)
- `mak2` (which is also `i`)
- `i` (the value of `i`)
- `mak2` (which is again `i`)

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? [i] [i] [i] [i]** (where `[i]` represents the value of `i`, which is `n + 1` and at least 3).
