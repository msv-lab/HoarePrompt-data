Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is at least 2, `s` is the input string from the user, `mak` is `i`, `pans` is a list containing the values `i` and `i`, `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `i` (which is `n + 2`) to the list `pans`. Since `pans` already contains the value `i`, after appending, `pans` will contain the value `i` twice. All other variables remain unchanged.
