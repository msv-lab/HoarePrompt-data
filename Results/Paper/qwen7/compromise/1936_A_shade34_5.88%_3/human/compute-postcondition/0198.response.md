Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is given to be at least 2, this condition is already satisfied.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` starts from `n` and `n` is at least 2.
   - Since `len(pans)` is less than `n`, and `pans` is an empty list, these states do not affect the loop execution directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2**
