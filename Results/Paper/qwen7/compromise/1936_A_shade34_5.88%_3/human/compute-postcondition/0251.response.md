Output State: **`i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive, and `mak` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is an operation related to how the program interacts with the user or another program, not a change in the state of variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `pans`, and `mak` remain unchanged.
