Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. This means that for each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `mak` is 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The input received is a string equal to '<', and the length of the string is 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop head, so it remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` remains at least 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `mak` remains 1.
   - `i` becomes 2.

So, the updated states for the next iteration are:

**State: `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 1, and `i` is 2.**
