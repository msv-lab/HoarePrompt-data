Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is either 1, 2, or 3.
- `i` is equal to the length of `pans`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('!', mak2, mak)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The value of `mak` is explicitly stated to be either 1, 2, or 3.
2. The variable `mak2` is not defined in the initial state, so it is not provided with a specific value. Since no value is given for `mak2`, it will be printed as it is, without any substitution.

Therefore, the output will include the literal string `'!'`, followed by the value of `mak2` (which is unknown but will be printed as is), and then the value of `mak`.

Output: **! mak2 mak** (where `mak2` is the value of `mak2` and `mak` is either 1, 2, or 3)
