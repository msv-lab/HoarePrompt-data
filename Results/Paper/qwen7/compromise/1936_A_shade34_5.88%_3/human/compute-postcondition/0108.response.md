Output State: **`mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, depending on the inputs received. `i` is `n`, and `n` remains the same as the initial input integer.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i=1` to `i=n-1`. During each iteration, `mak` is updated to `i` if the input is `<`. After `n-1` iterations, `i` will become `n`, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, `mak` can take any value from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive) based on the user's inputs during each iteration, or it could be `n-1` if the input was always `<` for all iterations.
