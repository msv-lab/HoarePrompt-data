Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, which can be either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` must have at least 2 elements, and no new variables have been assigned values by the code.**

Explanation: The line `sys.stdout.flush()` does not assign any new values to the existing variables or introduce any new variables. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously printed output is actually displayed. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
