Output State: **`mak` is `k + 1`, `pans` is undefined, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same as before the previous iteration**.

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, `mak` is now `k + 1`. The other variables (`pans`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
