Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive.
   - The input received is '>'.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `pans` is a list starting from `n` to `2n - 1`. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we will keep it as `n` and `2n - 1`.

However, the code snippet includes `pans[mak]`. The variable `mak` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value directly. But since the question does not provide any additional information about `mak`, we need to consider if there might be an implicit meaning or a common pattern in such problems. Typically, in such scenarios, `mak` could refer to the middle index of the list `pans` if the list length is odd, or it could be the index corresponding to the median if the list length is even. Without more context, let's assume `mak` refers to the middle index of the list `pans`.

Given that `pans` contains integers from `n` to `2n - 1`, the length of the list `pans` is `n`. If `n` is odd, the middle index would be `n // 2`. If `n` is even, the middle index would be `(n // 2) - 1` or `n // 2` depending on the specific implementation. For simplicity, let's assume `n` is odd, making the middle index `n // 2`.

So, `pans[mak]` would be the element at the middle index, which is `n + n // 2 - 1`.

Now, substituting the values:
- `pans[mak]` would be `n + n // 2 - 1`.
- `pans[i]` where `i` is 2, would be `n + 2 - 1 = n + 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
```python
print('?', n + n // 2 - 1, n + n // 2 - 1, n + 1, n + 1)
```

Output: **? [n + n // 2 - 1] [n + n // 2 - 1] [n + 1] [n + 1]**
