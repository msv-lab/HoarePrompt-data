Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `range(1, len(pans))`, which means the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive.
   - If the input string is '>', then `mak` is also 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - The length of the list `pans` does not change within the loop, so it remains `len(pans)`.
   - The conditions for `mak` and `pans` do not depend on the loop itself but on external conditions or other parts of the program, so they remain unchanged.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `pans` remains the same list.
   - `mak` remains unchanged based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive, and `mak` remains unchanged.**
