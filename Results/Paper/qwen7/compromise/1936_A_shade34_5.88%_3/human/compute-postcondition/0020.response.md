Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `mak` is 2, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or conditions. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed data is actually outputted. Since no variables are assigned new values or their conditions altered, the initial state remains unchanged.
