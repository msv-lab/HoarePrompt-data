Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of the variables `i` and `n`. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are modified, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
