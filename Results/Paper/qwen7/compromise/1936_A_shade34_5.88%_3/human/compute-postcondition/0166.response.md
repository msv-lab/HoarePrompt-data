Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is `n`
- `mak2` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `pans` must have at least 2 elements
- The input string is compared to '>', but since the specific input string is not provided, we assume it remains unchanged

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `pans[mak]` refers to the element at index `n` in the list `pans`.
- `pans[mak]` again refers to the same element, so it is the element at index `n` in the list `pans`.
- `pans[i]` refers to the element at index `n + 1` in the list `pans`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the following:
Output: **'? [element at index n in pans] [element at index n in pans] [element at index n+1 in pans] [element at index n+1 in pans]**
