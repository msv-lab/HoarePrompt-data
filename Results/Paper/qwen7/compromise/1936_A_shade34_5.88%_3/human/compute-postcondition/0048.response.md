Postcondition: **`s` is a new string input from the user. If `s` equals '<', then `mak` is `k + 1`, `pans` is `[i]`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is the same as before the previous iteration. Otherwise, `mak` is undefined, `pans` is a list containing the value `k + 1`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is the same as before the previous iteration.**
