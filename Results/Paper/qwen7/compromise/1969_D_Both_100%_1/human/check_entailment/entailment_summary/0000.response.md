Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in `func_4` aligns with the problem statement and the provided example.

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This part is handled by `func_1` and `func_4`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes a heap and a list to keep track of remaining items.
   - It reads `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It then reads the `a_i` (prices for Alice) and `b_i` (prices for Bob) values.
   - It creates a list of tuples combining negative prices and bonuses, sorts this list, and pushes the top `k` items into the heap.
   - It then iterates over the remaining items, calculating the profit based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.
   - It uses a heap to efficiently manage the items and update the profit.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The program correctly handles the scenario where Bob can take up to `k` items for free.
   - It ensures that Alice maximizes her profit by considering the best combination of items to sell to Bob.
   - The logic for updating the profit and managing the heap is consistent with the problem requirements.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly processed by the program. The output matches the expected results for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the implementation in `func_4` accurately follows the problem statement and correctly calculates Alice's profit for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
