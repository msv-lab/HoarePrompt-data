You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Output

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

    #- `heap` contains the last item from `combined` after all processing.
    #- `current_profit` is the final profit calculated after all operations within the loop.
    #- `max_profit` is the highest profit achieved during the loop's execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`test_cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads `n` integers for `prices` (Alice's prices).
   - It reads another `n` integers for `bonuses` (Bob's prices).

2. **Sorting and Heaps:**
   - The program sorts the combined list of negative prices and bonuses.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the top `k` items with the highest bonuses.
   - It calculates the initial profit by considering the first `k` items with the highest bonuses.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the remaining items and adjusts the profit based on whether adding an item increases the overall profit.
   - It uses the heap to efficiently manage the top `k` items and updates the profit accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Detailed Reasoning

1. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The heap is initialized with the top `k` items after sorting. This ensures that the items with the highest bonuses are considered first.

2. **Profit Calculation Logic:**
   - The program correctly handles the scenario where Bob can take up to `k` items for free.
   - It considers the remaining items and adjusts the profit based on whether including an item increases the overall profit.
   - The use of a min-heap allows efficient management of the top `k` items, ensuring that the logic for taking `k` items for free is correctly implemented.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is zero, meaning Bob cannot take any items for free.
   - It also handles scenarios where the combined value of an item (negative price + bonus) is non-positive, which means the item should not be included in the profit calculation.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's profit under the given constraints. The use of heaps and the sorting mechanism ensure that the optimal solution is found.
