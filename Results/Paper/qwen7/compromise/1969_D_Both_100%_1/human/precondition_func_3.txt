test_cases is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n. prices is a list of n integers where 1 <= price_i <= 10^9, and bonuses is a list of n integers where 1 <= bonus_i <= 10^9. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
