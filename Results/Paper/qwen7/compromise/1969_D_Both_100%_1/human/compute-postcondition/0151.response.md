Postcondition: **`heap` now contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of `removed_item`, and `item` is the last item popped from `combined`; if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is set to `current_profit`.**
