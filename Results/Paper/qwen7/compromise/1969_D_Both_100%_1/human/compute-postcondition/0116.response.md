Postcondition: **`current_profit` and `max_profit` remain unchanged if the sum of `item[0]` and `item[1]` is less than 0. Otherwise, `current_profit` is reduced by `item[1]` and `max_profit` remains equal to `current_profit`. `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is now one item shorter.**
