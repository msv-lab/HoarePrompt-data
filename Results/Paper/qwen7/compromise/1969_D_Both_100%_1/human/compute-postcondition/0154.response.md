Based on the initial state described:

- `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting the total of all `removed_item[0]` values from each iteration.
- `max_profit` is the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during any iteration.
- `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` after all items have been processed.
- `remaining_items` is an empty list.
- `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.
- `n` is the return value of `func_2()`.
- `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`.
- `combined` becomes empty after all iterations.

The `print(max_profit)` statement will print the highest value of `current_profit` that was encountered during the loop's execution.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the highest value of current_profit encountered during the loop's execution)**
