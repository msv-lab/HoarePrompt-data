Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a non-negative integer), `prices` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive), and `bonuses` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive). The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns different values based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

Note: The specific return values based on the conditions are not detailed here as per the given instructions, but they would be determined within the function's logic.
