Postcondition: `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, except for the item just pushed (which is `item`), and `remaining_items` is an empty list. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`.
