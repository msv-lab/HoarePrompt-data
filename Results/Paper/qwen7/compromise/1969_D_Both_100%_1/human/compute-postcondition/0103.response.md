Output State: **`current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined`, `current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` remains 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code updates `current_profit` by calling `func_3(combined, heap)`. The values of `heap`, `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged from their initial states except that `current_profit` is now the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`.
