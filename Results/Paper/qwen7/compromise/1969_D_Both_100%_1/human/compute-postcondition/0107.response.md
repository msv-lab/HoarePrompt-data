Postcondition: **`current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `current_profit` stays at 0, `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`, and all other variables (`heap`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses`) remain unchanged from their initial states as described in the precondition.
