Output State: **`combined` is fully processed, `heap` is an empty list, `current_profit` reflects the final profit, `max_profit` holds the highest profit, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2(), and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

The code `bonuses = list(func_2())` assigns the return value of the function `func_2()` to the variable `bonuses`. Since `func_2()` returns two values, `n` and `k`, the list `bonuses` will contain these two values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
