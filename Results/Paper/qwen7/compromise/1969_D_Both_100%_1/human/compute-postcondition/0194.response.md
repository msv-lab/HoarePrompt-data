Output State: **`max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` is `func_3(combined, heap)` + `item[0]`, `combined` is now a list with one item less than before (since `item = combined.pop()`), `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `heap` is an empty heap.**

Explanation: The code updates `current_profit` by adding `item[0]` to its current value. Since `item[0] + item[1]` is less than 0, `item[0]` is a negative number. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state as per the precondition.
