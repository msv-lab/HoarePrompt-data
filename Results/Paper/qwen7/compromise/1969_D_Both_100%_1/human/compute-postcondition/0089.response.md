Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(k):`. The only variable here is `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `k`**: From the given information, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 1. If `k` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`current_profit`, `max_profit`, `combined`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, `combined` is sorted by the second element of each tuple, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**
