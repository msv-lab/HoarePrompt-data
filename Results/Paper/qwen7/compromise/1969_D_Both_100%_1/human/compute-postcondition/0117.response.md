Output State: **`current_profit` is reduced by `item[1]` if the sum of `item[0]` and `item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it remains unchanged; `max_profit` remains equal to `current_profit`; `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, except for the item just pushed (which is `item`); `remaining_items` is an empty list; `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`; `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is now one item shorter.**

This means that the `heapq.heappushpop` function has replaced the last element of `heap` with `item`, potentially changing the `current_profit` and `max_profit` based on the condition, while keeping other variables unchanged or updating them according to their roles.
