Output State: **`combined` is fully processed, `heap` is an empty list, `current_profit` reflects the final profit, `max_profit` holds the highest profit, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`**.

This means that the function `func_2()` has been called, and it has returned two values which are assigned to `n` and `k`. The other variables remain in their initial states.
