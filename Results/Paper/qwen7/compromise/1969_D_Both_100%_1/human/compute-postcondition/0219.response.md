Output State: **`max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` or remains 0; `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]` if `removed_item` is not None; `item` is the last item popped from `combined`; `k` is less than or equal to 0; `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped; `removed_item` is the item that was heappushedpoped from the heap; `combined` is now one item shorter since the last item was popped.**

In this step, the code pops the last item from the `combined` list and assigns it to the variable `item`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
