Output State: **`current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, `heap` contains the tuple popped from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` must be greater than 0, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pops an element from the `combined` list (which is sorted by the second element of each tuple) and pushes it into the `heap`. Since `combined` was non-empty before the operation, it now contains one less element. The `heap` is updated with the popped element. All other variables remain unchanged.
