Output State: **`current_profit` is `item[0]`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is now one item shorter. Additionally, the first item of the last tuple in `heap` plus the second item of the last tuple in `heap` is less than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `current_profit` by adding the value of `item[0]` to it. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition about the sum of the first and second items of the last tuple in `heap` being less than 0 also remains valid.
