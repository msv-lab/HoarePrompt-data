Output State: **`max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` or remains 0; `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`; `item` is the last item popped from `combined`; `k` is less than or equal to 0; `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped; `removed_item` is the item that was heappushedpoped from the heap.**

Explanation: The code updates `current_profit` by subtracting `removed_item[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
