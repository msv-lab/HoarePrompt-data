Output State: **`current_profit` is the original reduced profit plus `item[0]`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `item` is the last item popped from `combined`, and `remaining_items` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit += item[0]` adds the value of `item[0]` to `current_profit`. The other variables (`heap`, `item`, and `remaining_items`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
