Output State: **`test_cases` must be a positive integer, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0.**

The code initializes `max_profit` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
