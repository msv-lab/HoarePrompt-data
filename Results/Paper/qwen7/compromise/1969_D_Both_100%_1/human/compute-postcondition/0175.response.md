Output State: **`max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` remains 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple (except the last one which was possibly popped), `k` is greater than 0, and if `combined` is not empty, `heap` is a heap containing the last element of the `combined` list after popping the last element and pushing it into the heap.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pops the last element from the `combined` list and pushes it onto the `heap`. This operation modifies the `combined` list by removing its last element and updates the `heap` by adding the popped element. All other variables (`max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `k`) remain unchanged. The condition for `heap` being a heap containing the last element of `combined` still holds true after the operation.
