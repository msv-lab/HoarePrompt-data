Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `current_profit` is reduced by the total of all `removed_item[0]` values from each iteration, `max_profit` is the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during any iteration, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is empty after all iterations, `test_cases` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `heap = []` initializes the `heap` variable to an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, `bonuses`, `combined`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial states.
