State: **`test_cases` must be a positive integer, n, k, prices, and bonuses must be defined for each test case**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head is `for _ in range(test_cases):`.
2. The only variable mentioned in the loop head is `_`, but since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition, we don't need to adjust its state.
3. The loop will execute as long as `test_cases` is a positive integer because `range(test_cases)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `test_cases - 1`.
4. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses` need to be defined. These values are required for the loop body to execute properly, even though they are not explicitly shown in the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `test_cases` must be a positive integer.
- `n`, `k`, `prices`, and `bonuses` must be defined for each test case.
