Output State: **`test_cases` must be a positive integer, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`**.

The code `bonuses = list(func_2())` assigns the return value of `func_2()` to the variable `bonuses`. Since `func_2()` returns two values (as indicated by the second return value `k`), `bonuses` will be a list containing these return values. The other variables remain unchanged.
