Output State: **`current_profit` remains 0, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is now one item shorter.**

Explanation: The code `item = combined.pop()` removes the last item from the `combined` list and assigns it to the variable `item`. The `combined` list is updated to be one item shorter. All other variables remain unchanged.
