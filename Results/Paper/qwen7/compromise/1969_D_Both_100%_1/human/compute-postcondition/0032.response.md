Postcondition: `current_profit` is the return value of `func_3(combined, heap)`, `test_cases` remains a positive integer, `heap` contains all elements from `combined` after each has been popped once (i.e., `k` times), except for the last item which has just been popped, `remaining_items` remains an empty list, `neg_prices` remains a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` remains a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` remains the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is 0, `max_profit` is equal to the maximum of its original value and `current_profit`, `combined` remains a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, with the last item popped, and the current value of `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0.
