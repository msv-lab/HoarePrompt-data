Reasoning:
1. The annotated program seems to be incomplete and does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1()` does not correctly calculate the number of tuples \((x, y, z)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
2. The `prefix` list is correctly computed as the cumulative XOR of the array elements.
3. The `pre` and `suf` lists are intended to count the occurrences of 0s and 1s at each bit position in the cumulative XOR values, but the implementation of these lists is incorrect.
4. The final calculation of `ans` is also incorrect because it does not properly account for the XOR condition \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\).
5. The provided example outputs do not match the expected results based on the problem statement and the given test cases.

Given these observations, the program is not correctly implementing the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
