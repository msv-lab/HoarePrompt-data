Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `prefix` is a list containing the integer 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
Code of the loop:
for v in arr:
    prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `prefix` is a list containing the integer 0 and another integer which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, and `arr` must have at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `prefix` is a list containing the integer 0, another integer which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`, and an additional element which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, and `arr` must have at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `prefix` is a list containing the integer 0, another integer which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`, and an additional element which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`, and now `prefix` has an extra element which is `v ^ prefix[-1]`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, and `arr` must have at least one element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
