Output State: **`j` is 0; `n` is 32; `y` is `arr[0]`; `k` is 5; `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`; `c` is `prefix[1]`; `pre[0][0]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1, where `j` is 0. So, `pre[0][0]` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
