Output State: **`i` is 30; `j` is 0; `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1**

Given the initial state where `i` is 30 and `j` is 0, the code snippet `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Since `j` is 0, it affects `suf[0][1]`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `suf[0][1]`.
