Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `pre[1][0]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, `pre[1][0]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
