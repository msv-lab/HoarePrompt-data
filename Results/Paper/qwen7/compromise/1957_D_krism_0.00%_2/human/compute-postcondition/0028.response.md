Output State: **`i` is 32, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[32]`, `j` is 0, `suf[0][1]` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the second element of the list `suf[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, it increments the second element of `suf[0]` by 1. Since no initial value for `suf[0][1]` was provided, we assume it starts at 0, so after the increment, `suf[0][1]` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
