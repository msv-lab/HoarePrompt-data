Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is 2, `suf[2][1]` is -1**

Explanation: The value of `suf[2][1]` is decremented by 1. Initially, `suf[2][1]` was 1. After executing `suf[j][1] -= 1`, the value of `suf[2][1]` becomes 1 - 1, which is -1. The values of `c` and `j` remain unchanged, and the value of `pre[2][1]` is still 1.
