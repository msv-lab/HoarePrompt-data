Output State: **`j` is 0, `c` is `prefix[34]`, `k` is 5, `y` is `arr[32]`, `ans` is updated by adding `pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][0]`, `c` remains `prefix[34]`, `i` is now 34, and `suf[j][0]` is now `suf[0][0] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, the value of `suf[0][0]` is reduced by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
