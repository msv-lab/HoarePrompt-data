Output State: **`c` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1, `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] -= 1` decreases the second element of the list `suf[j]` by 1. The first element of `pre[j]` is increased by 1 as mentioned in the initial state, and this value remains unchanged. The other variables retain their initial states.
