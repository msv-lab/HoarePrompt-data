Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted according to the rules.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop runs from `n` down to 1, decrementing by 1 each time.
   - The loop will run 32 times because `i` will be set to 32 initially and decremented until it reaches 1.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**:
   - Since the loop runs 32 times and ends when `i` is 1, the initial value of `i` must be 32.

4. **Determine the Value of `n`**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `n` must be 32 because the loop starts with `i` at 32 and decrements until `i` is 1.

5. **Consider the `pre` List**:
   - The problem states that after the loop has executed, each sublist in the `pre` list will have its first element set to 32.
   - This implies that the loop body must be setting the first element of each sublist in `pre` to 32 during each iteration.
   - However, since we are only asked to adjust the state for the loop to execute, we do not need to specify the contents of `pre` in the initial state.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 32, `n` is 32**.
