Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = 31`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 30
   - `j` is less than 32 (so it could be any value from 0 to 31)

4. **Analyze the loop body**: The loop body updates the `suf` array based on the value of `cur >> j & 1`. If this expression is true, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is set to 1.

5. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `j` was less than 32 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 30.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so if `j` was 31 before, it will now be 0 (looping back to the start).
   - The condition `j < 32` still holds true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 30, `j` is 0**
