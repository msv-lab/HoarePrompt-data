Based on the initial state provided, the variables and objects do not have any specific values assigned to them. The only information given is about the range of the integer `t` and the constraints on `n` and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. However, the `print` statement itself does not reference any of these variables or objects.

The code snippet simply prints a string:

```python
print('-----------------')
```

This will print a hyphenated line consisting of 13 dashes.

Output: **-----------------**
