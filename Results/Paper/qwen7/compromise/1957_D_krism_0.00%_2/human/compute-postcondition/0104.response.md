Output State: **`j` is 0; `n` is 32; `y` is `arr[0]`; `k` is 5; `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`; `c` is `prefix[1]`; `pre[0][0]` is 1; `suf[0][0]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, the specific value being modified is `suf[0][0]`. Initially, `pre[0][0]` is 1, but since no operation affects `pre`, its value remains unchanged. All other variables remain in their initial state as no operation affects them.
