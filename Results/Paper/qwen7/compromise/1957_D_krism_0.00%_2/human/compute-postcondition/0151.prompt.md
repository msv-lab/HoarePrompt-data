Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is 31, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[31]`, `k` is `arr[31].bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1] + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `c` is `prefix[32]`, `i` is 32
Code of the loop:
for j in range(32):
    if c >> j & 1:
        pre[j][1] += 1
        suf[j][1] -= 1
    else:
        pre[j][0] += 1
        suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `c` is an integer, `j` is an integer. If `c >> j & 1` is true, then `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is set to 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `c` is an integer, `j` is an integer. If `c` right-shifted by `j` and bitwise AND with 1 is true, then `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `c` is an integer, `j` is 2. If `c` shifted right by `j` and bitwise AND with 1 results in 1, then `suf[2][1]` is -1. Otherwise, `pre[2][0]` is 1 and `suf[2][0]` is -1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
