Output State: **`i` is 31, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 0, `suf` is an array where each element `suf[j]` is a list containing two integers, and `suf[0][0]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the first element of the list `suf[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 0, it updates `suf[0][0]` from its initial unspecified value (which was false and thus 0) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
