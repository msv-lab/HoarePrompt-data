Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the string and performing cyclic shifts to move all '0's to the left and all '1's to the right.
2. However, the logic in the `func_1` function does not correctly implement the required cyclic shift operations. Instead, it performs a simple swap between adjacent characters if they are in the wrong order, which is not equivalent to a cyclic shift.
3. The program incorrectly calculates the cost as the sum of the sizes of the subarrays that would need to be swapped, but this approach does not account for the actual cyclic nature of the operation.
4. The execution summary mentions that the function returns 11 if the length of `sChar` is exactly 11 and 11 plus the number of additional characters beyond 11 otherwise. This is not a correct solution to the problem and does not reflect the intended behavior of cyclic shifts.
5. The provided examples in the execution summary do not match the expected behavior of the program, indicating that the program is not solving the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the cyclic shift operation and does not accurately calculate the minimum cost to sort the string.
