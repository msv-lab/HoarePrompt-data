### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, and the result is printed, which is correct.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - The function initializes an empty list `s`, iterates through the string `sChar` to convert it into a list of characters, and sets initial values for `left`, `right`, and `cost`.
   - **Main Loop**:
     - The main loop runs until `left` is less than or equal to `right` and `right` is within the bounds of the list.
     - If a '0' is found at `right` and a '1' is found at `left`, it swaps them and increments the cost by the length of the substring between `left` and `right`.
     - It then moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1'.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The logic handles the edge cases where the entire string might be already sorted or needs multiple shifts to become sorted.
   - **Return Statement**:
     - The function returns the accumulated cost after processing the entire string.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the main loop. Specifically, the loop does not correctly handle the scenario where a '1' is encountered before a '0' during the iteration. This can lead to incorrect swapping and cost calculation.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Annotated Code Explanation**:
  - The annotated code states that `left` becomes 11 after the third iteration, and the loop continues until `left` equals the length of `s`. This is incorrect because the loop should terminate when no more swaps are needed.
  - The annotated code suggests that the final value of `cost` is `len(s) - 10`, but this is not always true. The actual cost depends on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string.

- **Example Analysis**:
  - Consider the string "101011". The annotated code suggests that the cost is 9, but let's analyze it step-by-step:
    1. Initial state: `s = ['1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '1']`
    2. First swap: `s[1], s[3] = s[3], s[1]` → `s = ['1', '0', '1', '1', '0', '1']` (cost = 4)
    3. Second swap: `s[3], s[4] = s[4], s[3]` → `s = ['1', '0', '1', '1', '0', '1']` (cost = 8)
    4. Third swap: `s[4], s[5] = s[5], s[4]` → `s = ['1', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0']` (cost = 12)

  - The actual cost is 12, not 9. The annotated code incorrectly assumes that the cost is always `len(s) - 10`.

- **Correctness**:
  - The original assessment is incorrect because the annotated code provides an incorrect analysis of the loop behavior and the final cost calculation.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the main loop, which leads to incorrect cost calculations.
