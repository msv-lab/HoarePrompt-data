### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, and the result is printed, which is correct.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - The function initializes an empty list `s`, iterates through the string `sChar` to convert it into a list of characters, and sets initial values for `left`, `right`, and `cost`.
   - **Main Loop**:
     - The main loop runs until `left` is less than or equal to `right` and `right` is within the bounds of the list.
       - If a '0' is found at `right` and a '1' is found at `left`, it swaps them and increments the cost by the length of the substring between `left` and `right`.
       - It then moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1'.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The logic handles the edge cases where the entire string might be already sorted or needs multiple shifts to become sorted.
   - **Return Statement**:
     - The function returns the accumulated cost after processing the entire string.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the function `func_1`. The main issue lies in how the `left` and `right` pointers are managed and how the cost is calculated.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Pointer Management**:
   - The `left` and `right` pointers are used to find the positions of '0' and '1', respectively.
   - The logic to move `right` to the next '0' and `left` to the next '1' is flawed because it does not ensure that the entire string is processed correctly.
   - For example, consider the string "101011". The function will swap the first '1' and '0' but will not continue to process the rest of the string correctly. The `left` and `right` pointers will get stuck, leading to incorrect results.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost is incremented by the length of the substring between `left` and `right` each time a swap is made.
   - However, the way the pointers are moved ensures that the cost calculation is not cumulative and may miss necessary swaps.

3. **Example Counter-Case**:
   - Consider the string "101011":
     - Initial state: `s = ['1', '0', '1', '0', '1', '1']`
     - First iteration: Swap '1' and '0' -> `s = ['0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '1']`
     - Cost = 2
     - Next iteration: `left` and `right` pointers do not move further, and the function returns the incorrect cost of 2 instead of the correct cost of 9.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The pointers management and cost calculation are flawed, leading to incorrect results for certain test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
