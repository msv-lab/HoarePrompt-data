### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided program and why it fails to correctly solve the problem.

#### Issues with the Provided Program:

1. **Incorrect Approach to Cyclic Shifts**:
   - The program attempts to swap adjacent characters directly to move '0's to the left and '1's to the right. This is not an efficient way to calculate the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.
   - For example, consider the string "101011". The program would try to swap '1' and '0' directly, leading to incorrect results. The correct approach involves identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and then performing cyclic shifts on the remaining part of the string.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cost as the length of the substring being swapped, which is not always the correct measure for the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.
   - For instance, in the string "101011", the program might incorrectly calculate the cost as 5, but the correct cost should be 9.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program does not handle the logic of identifying the longest sorted prefix and then performing the necessary cyclic shifts to sort the rest of the string.
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to minimize the total cost.

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify the longest prefix that is already sorted.
2. Calculate the cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the remaining part of the string.

This requires a more sophisticated algorithm, such as:
1. Finding the longest prefix that is already sorted.
2. Calculating the cost of cyclic shifts for the remaining part of the string.

The provided program does not implement this logic correctly.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
