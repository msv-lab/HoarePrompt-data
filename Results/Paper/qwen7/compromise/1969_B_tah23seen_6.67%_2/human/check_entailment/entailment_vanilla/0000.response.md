Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(s)` for each test case and prints the result, which is correct.
3. **Function Implementation**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `s`, iterates through the string `sChar` to convert it into a list of characters, and sets initial values for `left`, `right`, and `cost`.
   - **Main Loop**: The main loop runs until `left` is less than or equal to `right` and `right` is within the bounds of the list.
     - If a '0' is found at `right` and a '1' is found at `left`, it swaps them and increments the cost by the length of the substring between `left` and `right`.
     - It then moves the `right` pointer to the next '0' and the `left` pointer to the next '1'.
   - **Edge Cases**: The logic handles the edge cases where the entire string might be already sorted or needs multiple shifts to become sorted.
   - **Return Statement**: The function returns the accumulated cost after processing the entire string.

Given the provided problem description and the implementation of the function, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

Correctness: **True**
