Output State: **`left` is 5, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - 4`, `right` is greater than 8, the length of `s` must be at least 2, `s[1]` must not be '1', `s[4]` must not be '1', and no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0', and `s[right]` must not be '0'**.

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1, making it `right + 1`. Since the initial condition was that `right` is greater than 7, after incrementing, `right` is now greater than 8. All other conditions and the state of the variables remain unchanged.
