Output State: `left` is 1, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - left + 1`, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and the length of `s` must be at least 2, and no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0'.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `right` as long as `right` is less than the length of `s` and the character at position `right` is not '0'. After the loop completes all its iterations, `right` will be equal to the length of `s`, meaning it has traversed the entire string without encountering a '0' character in the process. All other variables (`left`, `s`, `i`, and `cost`) remain unchanged from their final state after the third iteration.
