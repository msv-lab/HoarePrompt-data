Output State: `left` is 11, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is 11, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.

Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop continues to increment `left` until it reaches the end of the string `s` or encounters a '1'. Given that `left` is 11 after the third iteration and the loop condition `left < len(s)` must hold, `left` will continue to increment until it reaches the length of `s`. This means `left` will be equal to the length of `s`, making `right` also equal to the length of `s` since the loop terminates when `left` equals `right`. 

Since the loop increments `cost` by `right - left + 1` each time it swaps elements, and `right` is now equal to `len(s)`, the final value of `cost` will be `len(s) - 11 + 1 = len(s) - 10`. Given that `left` is 11, the length of `s` must be at least 11 for the loop to have completed its iterations. Therefore, `cost` will be `11` if the length of `s` is exactly 11, and it will increase accordingly if the length of `s` is greater than 11. The other variables remain unchanged from their final state after the third iteration.
