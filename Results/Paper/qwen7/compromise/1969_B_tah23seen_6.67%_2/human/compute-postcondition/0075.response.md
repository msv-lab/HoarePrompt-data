Output State: `left` is 11, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is 11, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.

Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop continues to execute until `left` reaches the length of the string `s` or encounters a '1' at `s[left]`. Given that the loop increments `left` and updates the `cost` with the difference between `right` and `left` plus one whenever a swap occurs, and considering the final state after three iterations where `left` is 11, it indicates that the loop has completed its iterations. Since `right` is equal to the length of `s`, it means the loop has terminated just before accessing an index out of bounds, implying that `s[left]` must have become '1' or `left` reached the end of the string. Therefore, the final value of `cost` will be `right - left + 1`, which is `len(s) - 11 + 1 = len(s) - 10`. Given the progression and the conditions met, the final state of `left` is 11, `cost` is 11, and `right` is equal to the length of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop body.
