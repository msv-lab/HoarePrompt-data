Output State: `left` is 5, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - 4`, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, the length of `s` must be at least 2, `s[1]` must not be '1', `s[4]` must not be '1', no character in `s` is '0'.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `right` until it reaches the end of the list `s` or encounters a '0'. Since the loop executes three times and `right` increases by 1 each time, after all iterations, `right` will be equal to the length of `s`. The conditions on `s[1]`, `s[4]`, and the absence of '0' characters from `right` onwards remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
