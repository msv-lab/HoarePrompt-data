The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, x, and y. For each test case, it calculates a non-negative integer t based on specific conditions involving x and y. The final value of t is determined through a series of arithmetic operations and conditional checks. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated t for each case.
