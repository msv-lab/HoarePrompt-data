Output State: `t` is a non-negative integer determined by the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each iteration of the loop, with `t` being updated based on specific conditions within the loop body. The final value of `t` after all iterations will be the result of applying the loop's logic to each pair of inputs `(a, b)` from `range(n)`.
