### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and initializes the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation for Bodya and Sasha**:
   - The program correctly tracks the path taken by Bodya and Sasha using the permutation `p`.
   - It ensures that the paths are calculated correctly by appending the scores at each step and updating the current position.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for both Bodya and Sasha by considering the sum of the scores along their respective paths up to length `k`.
   - This is done by iterating through the paths and computing the cumulative score for each segment of the path.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The program compares the total scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Initialization and Input Reading**: 
  - The code correctly initializes variables and reads inputs as expected.

- **Path Calculation**:
  - The paths for Bodya and Sasha are correctly calculated using the permutation `p`.

- **Score Calculation**:
  - The logic for calculating the maximum score for each path is correct. It considers the sum of scores along the path up to `k` steps.

- **Output**:
  - The output is determined correctly based on the comparison of the scores.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
