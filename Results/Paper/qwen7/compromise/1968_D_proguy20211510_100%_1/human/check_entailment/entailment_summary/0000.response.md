Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \).
2. It constructs the paths for Bodya and Sasha by following the permutation \( p \) and collecting scores along these paths.
3. The program calculates the maximum possible score for each player by considering segments of their respective paths up to length \( k \).
4. The logic for calculating the maximum score for each player seems correct, as it considers all possible segments of the path up to the \( k \)-th turn.
5. The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

Given the execution summary and the detailed analysis, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent errors in the code that would lead to incorrect results based on the provided problem description and the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
