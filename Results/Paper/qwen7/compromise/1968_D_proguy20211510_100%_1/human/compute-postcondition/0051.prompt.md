Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is updated to 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is the final value it reaches after following the links in the list `p` until a previously visited node is encountered, `ps` is an integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is an empty list, and `vis[pb - 1]` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is updated to 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is the final value it reaches after following the links in the list `p` until a previously visited node is encountered, `ps` is an integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is an empty list, `vis[pb - 1]` remains unchanged, `paths` is a list with the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is updated to 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is the final value it reaches after following the links in the list `p` until a previously visited node is encountered, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is an empty list, `vis[pb - 1]` remains unchanged, `paths` is a list with the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is updated to 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is the final value it reaches after following the links in the list `p` until a previously visited node is encountered, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is an empty list, `vis[pb - 1]` remains unchanged, `paths` is a list with the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it, `ps` is updated to the new value of `p[ps - 1]`, and if `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
