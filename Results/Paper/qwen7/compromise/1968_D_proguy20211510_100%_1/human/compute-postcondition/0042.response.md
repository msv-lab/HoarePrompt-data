Output State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is updated to 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is the final value it reaches after following the links in the list `p` until a previously visited node is encountered, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is an empty list, `vis[pb - 1]` remains unchanged, `paths` is a list with the element `a[ps - 1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ps` to `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
