Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(pathb)`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(pathb)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `len(pathb)` is a positive integer
   - `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`
   - `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`
   - `preb` is `preb + pathb[0]`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `len(pathb)`. Since `i` is now 1, `len(pathb)` must be greater than 1.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `len(pathb)` must be greater than 1.

The other variables (`resb`, `curr`, `preb`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `len(pathb)` must be greater than 1**
