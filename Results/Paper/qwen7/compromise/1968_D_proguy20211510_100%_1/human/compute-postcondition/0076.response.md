Output State: **`i` is 4; `preb` is `preb + pathb[0] + pathb[1] + pathb[2]`; `k` is less than 5; `curr` is `preb + pathb[3] * (k - 3)`; `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`; all other variables retain their values from the last iteration of the loop or their initial values if they were not modified within the loop.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` has reached the length of `pathb` minus one (i.e., 4), since `pathb` is indexed starting from 0. The variable `preb` has accumulated the sum of all elements in `pathb`. The condition `k < i + 1` has been checked and found false, so the loop has exited. The variable `curr` holds the value of the last computed maximum contribution to `resb`, which is based on the last element of `pathb` and the remaining value of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop body.
