Output State: **`i` is 4, `preb` is `preb + pathb[2]`, `k` is less than 5, `curr` is `preb + pathb[4] * (k - 4)`, and if `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `preb += pathb[i]` increments `preb` by the value of `pathb[i]`. Given that `i` is 4, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[4]`. The other variables (`k`, `curr`, and the condition involving `k`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.
