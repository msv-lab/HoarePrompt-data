Output State: **`i` is 1, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0]`, `k` is unchanged, `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variable values, the values of `i`, `preb`, `k`, `curr`, and `resb` remain as they were before the statement was executed.
