Output State: **`i` equals `len(pathb)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths` plus the last element of `pathb` multiplied by `(k - len(paths) + 1)`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr` for all iterations, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop (which in this case never happens), `ps` is now the final value of `p[ps - 1]` after the loop, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now a list of `k` elements, each being `a[ps - 1]`, `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1), `resb` is equal to the maximum value of `curr` calculated over all iterations, `ress` is equal to `resb`, `curr` is equal to `pres + paths[i-1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)` (since `i` equals `len(pathb)`).**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, and `i` has reached the length of `pathb`. The value of `preb` remains the sum of all elements in `pathb`. The value of `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths` plus the last element of `pathb` multiplied by `(k - len(paths) + 1)`. The variable `ress` holds the maximum value between `ress` and `curr` for all iterations. All other variables retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
