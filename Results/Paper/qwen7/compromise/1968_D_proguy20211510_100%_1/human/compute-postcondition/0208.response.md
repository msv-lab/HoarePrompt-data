Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `curr` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1] * (k - (i_end + 1) - 1)`, `pres` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1] + paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The line `pres += paths[i]` increments `pres` by the value of `paths[i]`. Since `i` was initially `i_end + 1`, it remains unchanged. The value of `curr` is updated to reflect the new value of `pres` after adding `paths[i]`, which means `curr` is now `pres + paths[i_end + 1] * (k - (i_end + 1) - 1)` because the term `(k - (i_end + 1))` decreases by 1. The variable `pres` is updated to `pres + paths[i_end + 1] + paths[i]`. The value of `ress` remains the same unless `curr` is greater than `ress`, in which case `ress` would be updated to `curr`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, as mentioned in the initial state.
