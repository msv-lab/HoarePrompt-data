Output State: `total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `curr` is undefined, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is now the final value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, and `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1). The loop has executed until `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, which caused the loop to break. The final state of `paths` is the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, and `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`. `ress` will hold the maximum value between its previous value and `curr` at each iteration, but since `curr` is undefined, `ress` remains unchanged from its initial state.
