Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers, p is a permutation of length n, a is an array of positive integers, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pathb, paths = [], []
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[pb - 1] = 1
    while True:
        pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
        if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
            break
    vis = [0] * n
    vis[ps - 1] = 1
    while True:
        paths.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]
        if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
            break
    resb, ress = 0, 0
    preb, pres = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(pathb)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
        preb += pathb[i]
        resb = max(resb, curr)
    for i in range(len(paths)):
        if k < i + 1:
            break
        curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
        pres += paths[i]
        ress = max(ress, curr)
    if resb > ress:
        print('Bodya')
    elif ress > resb:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `pres` is the sum of `paths[4] * (k - 3)`, `paths[5]`, and `paths[6]` up to the last element where the condition `k < i + 1` holds true, `curr` is calculated based on the current value of `pres` and the current element of `paths`, `ress` keeps track of the maximum value of `curr` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, and `resb` is either greater than or equal to `ress`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, and `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, then `ress` is updated to `resb`. Otherwise, `ress` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` equals `len(pathb)`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths` plus the last element of `pathb` multiplied by `(k - len(paths) + 1)`, `ress` is equal to `resb`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop (which in this case never happens), `ps` is now the final value of `p[ps - 1]` after the loop, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now a list of `k` elements, each being `a[ps - 1]`, `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1), `resb` is equal to the maximum value of `curr` calculated over all iterations, and `ress` is equal to `resb` regardless of whether `resb` is greater than `ress` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
