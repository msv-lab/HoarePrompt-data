Output State: **`pres` is equal to `paths[4] * (k - 3)`, `curr` is the result of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to be the sum of `pres` and `paths[i] * (k - i)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Specifically, `pres` remains equal to `paths[4] * (k - 3)`, `curr` is updated to reflect the new calculation, `ress` remains the maximum of its previous value and the new `curr`, and `i` is incremented by 1.
