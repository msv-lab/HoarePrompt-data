Output State: **`curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `i` is 2, `preb` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1) + pathb[2]`, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`**.

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates the value of `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `curr`. Since `curr` is defined as `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, and no other changes are made to `resb`, the output state includes the unchanged values of `curr`, `i`, and `preb`, along with the updated `resb` which now holds the maximum value between its original value and `curr`.
