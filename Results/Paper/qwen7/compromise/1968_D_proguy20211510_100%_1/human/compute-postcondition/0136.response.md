Output State: `pathb` is a list containing all the values of `a[pb - 1]` that were added during each iteration of the loop until `vis[pb - 1]` became 1 on a previously visited index, `paths` is an empty list, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers converted from their respective input values, `vis` is a list of n zeros where the elements at the indices of all previously visited `pb` values are now 1, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` remain in their previous states, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, and `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]` until the condition `vis[pb - 1] == 1` is met.

This means that `pathb` will contain the sequence of elements from the list `a` as traced by following the `p` array from the starting index `pb` until a previously visited index is encountered, marking the end of the loop.
