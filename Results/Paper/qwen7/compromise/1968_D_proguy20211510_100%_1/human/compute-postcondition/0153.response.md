The loop in question is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once and continue to do so unless explicitly broken out of. Since there are no conditions specified in the loop head to determine when it should terminate, we do not need to adjust any specific states to make it execute one more time.

However, since the loop will always execute, we can simply repeat the current state without making any changes to the variables.

State: **`vis` is now `[1, 1] + [0] * (n - 2)`, `pathb` is unchanged, `paths` is now `[p[ps - 1], a[ps - 1]]`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain as integers converted from their respective input values, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` remain in their previous states, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `vis[ps - 1] == 1`.**
