Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers converted from their respective input values, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` remain in their previous states, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged as they were already integers. The variables `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` also remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.
