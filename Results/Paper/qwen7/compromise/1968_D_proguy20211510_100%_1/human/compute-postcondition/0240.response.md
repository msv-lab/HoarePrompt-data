Output State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the index `pb - 1` which is set to 1, `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + a[pb - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]` appended with `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis[pb - 1]` remains 0.**

Explanation: The code `pb = p[pb - 1]` updates the value of `pb` to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `pb` while keeping all other variables in their original state.
