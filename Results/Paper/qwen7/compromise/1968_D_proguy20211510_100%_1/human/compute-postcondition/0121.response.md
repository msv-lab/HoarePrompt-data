Output State: **`pathb` is a list containing the value of `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers converted from their respective input values, `vis` is a list of n zeros where the element at index `pb - 1` is now 1, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` remain in their previous states, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

This means that the list `pathb` has been updated to include the value of `a[pb - 1]`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
