Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `curr` is undefined, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now `[a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1]]`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1)**

Explanation: The line `paths.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the value of `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. Before this operation, `paths` was `[a[ps - 1]]`. After appending, `paths` becomes `[a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
