Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `curr` is `pres + a[pb - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now `[a[ps - 1]]`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1).**

Explanation: The code appends `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. Initially, `paths` is an empty list, so after appending, `paths` becomes `[a[ps - 1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
