Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads positive integers \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \), a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \), and an array \( a \) of positive integers. It then calculates two paths, one starting from \( P_B \) and the other from \( P_S \), and determines the maximum sum of segments of these paths up to length \( k \). Based on the comparison of these sums, it prints either "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".**
