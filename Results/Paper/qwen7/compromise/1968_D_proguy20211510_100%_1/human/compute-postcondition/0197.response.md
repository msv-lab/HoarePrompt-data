Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. The only information that remains is that `i` is `i_end + 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
