Output State: **`vis` is now `[1, 1] + [0] * (n - 2)`, `pathb` is unchanged, `paths` is an empty list, the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain as integers converted from their respective input values, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` remain in their previous states, the list `a` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `vis[ps - 1] = 1` updates the `vis` list by setting the element at index `ps - 1` to `1`. Given that `vis` initially is `[1] + [0] * (n - 1)`, the first element is `1` and the rest are `0`s. If `ps` is `2`, then `vis[ps - 1]` corresponds to the second element in the list, which is set to `1`. Thus, the updated `vis` list becomes `[1, 1] + [0] * (n - 2)`. All other variables and lists remain unchanged.
