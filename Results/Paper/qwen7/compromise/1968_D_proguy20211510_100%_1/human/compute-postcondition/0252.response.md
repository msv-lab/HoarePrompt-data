Output State: **`vis[ps - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1), `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `vis[ps - 1]`, `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + a[pb - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1).**

This means that the value of `vis[ps - 1]` has been set to 1, indicating it is now marked as visited. All other variables retain their previous values or states as described in the initial state.
