Output State: **t is a positive integer, n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers, p is a permutation of length n, a is an array of positive integers, alpha is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO', MOD is 1000000007**

The code initializes the variable `alpha` with the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. This assignment does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, all the variables retain their initial states except for `alpha`, which is now specifically set to the given string.
