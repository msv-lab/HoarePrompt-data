Functionality: **The function processes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) to find specific indices based on the outcome of calls to `func_1`. It first identifies the index of the first occurrence of a specific character ('<') in a sequence using `func_1` and stores it in `max_index`. Then, it collects all indices where `func_1` returns '<' and stores them in `min_indices`. After that, it updates `min_indices` to only include indices that are not equal to `max_index`. Finally, it finds the minimum index from the updated `min_indices` and calls `func_2` with `max_index` and `min_index` as arguments. The function does not return any value.**
