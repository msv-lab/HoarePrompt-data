Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specified that `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4`, the input must also satisfy this condition. Therefore, after executing the code, `n` is updated to the integer value entered by the user, which is within the given range.
