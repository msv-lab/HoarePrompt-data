Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and initializes the main loop to handle each test case. This part is correct.

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1` is defined to perform a query and return the result.
   - `func_2` is defined to provide the final answer.
   - `func_3` is defined to handle the logic for finding the indices with the maximum XOR value.

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR**:
   - For `n == 2`, the program directly outputs the indices `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`, which is correct since the maximum XOR for two elements in a permutation of `{0, 1}` is `1`.
   - For `n > 2`, the program attempts to find the indices with the maximum XOR value using a series of queries.
     - It first tries to find an index `max_index` where `(p_0 | p_{max_index})` is less than `(p_0 | p_i)` for some `i`. This helps in identifying a candidate for the maximum XOR.
     - Then it tries to find the minimum index `min_index` among the candidates where `(p_{max_index} | p_{min_index})` is less than or equal to `(p_{max_index} | p_i)` for all `i` in `min_indices`.

4. **Query Logic**:
   - The logic for finding `max_index` and `min_indices` seems to be flawed. Specifically, the logic to identify `min_indices` and then select `min_index` might not correctly identify the indices that maximize the XOR value.
   - The approach of finding `max_index` and then trying to find `min_indices` and `min_index` does not guarantee that the selected indices will have the maximum XOR value.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the indices `max_index` and `min_index` as the final answer. However, due to the flawed logic, this output might not always be correct.

Given the above reasoning, the program's logic for finding the indices with the maximum XOR value is incorrect. Therefore, the program will not always produce the correct answer.

Correctness: **False**
