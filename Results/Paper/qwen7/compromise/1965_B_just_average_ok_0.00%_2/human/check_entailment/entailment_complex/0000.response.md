Reasoning:
1. The function correctly processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` for each test case.
2. It constructs the list `nums` to ensure that:
   - No subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.
3. The construction of `nums` ensures that:
   - Powers of 2 up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` are included.
   - Additional elements are added to cover the gaps and ensure that all sums from 1 to `n-1` (excluding `k`) can be formed.
4. The removal of the largest power of 2 from `nums` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.
5. The final list `nums` will have exactly 25 elements, as required.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program appears to meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
