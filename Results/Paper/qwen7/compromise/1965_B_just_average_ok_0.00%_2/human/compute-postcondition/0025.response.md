Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.
2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\).
   - `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split.
   - `k` is at least 16777216.
   - `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).
   - `idx` is 1.

3. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `k` and `idx`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `idx` is currently 1.
   - `k` is at least 16777216, and since `1 << 1` is 2, `k` is indeed greater than or equal to \(1 << 1\).

5. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must remain greater than or equal to \(1 << idx\). Since `idx` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `k` remains at least 2.
   - `idx` can be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so we need to ensure that `idx` becomes 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `idx` should be 2.
- `k` should remain at least 2 (or more specifically, it should remain at least 16777216, but this is already satisfied).

State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 2**
