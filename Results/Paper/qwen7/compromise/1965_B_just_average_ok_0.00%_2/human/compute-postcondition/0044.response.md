Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\).
   - `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split.
   - `k` must be at least 1.
   - `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).
   - `idx` is 1.

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `k` and `idx`.

4. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must be greater than or equal to \(1 << idx\).
   - Given `idx` is 1, the condition becomes `k >= 1 << 1`, which simplifies to `k >= 2`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `idx` is fixed at 1, we cannot change it.
   - We need to ensure that `k` is at least 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `k` is at least 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` must be at least 2, `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 1**
