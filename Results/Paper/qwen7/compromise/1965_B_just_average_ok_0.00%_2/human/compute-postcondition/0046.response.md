Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\).
   - `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split (this value doesn't affect the loop condition directly).
   - `k` must be at least 2.
   - `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\).
   - `idx` is 2.

3. **Determine the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `k` and `idx`.

4. **Check the loop condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `k >= 1 << idx`.
   - Given `idx` is 2, `1 << idx` equals `1 << 2 = 4`.
   - Therefore, the loop condition becomes `k >= 4`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 4.
   - Since `k` must be at least 2 initially, the minimum value for `k` to continue the loop is 4.
   - Other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `idx`) do not affect the loop condition and do not need adjustment.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `k` must be at least 4.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` must be at least 4, `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 2**
