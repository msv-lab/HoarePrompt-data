Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was set to 2, so after executing the code, `idx` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
