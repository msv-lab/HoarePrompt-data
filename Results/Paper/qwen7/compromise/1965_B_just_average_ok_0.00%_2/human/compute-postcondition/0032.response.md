Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is less than 16, `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 3, `nums` is now `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k-16]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 3, `nums[3]` is 8. Therefore, the new element appended to `nums` is `k - 8`. Since `k` is less than 16, `k - 8` will be a value between -7 and 7 (inclusive). However, the exact value of `k - 8` is not specified, so it is represented as `k - 16` in the updated list.
