Output State: The loop will execute `num_tests` times, where `num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000. For each test case, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n. After all iterations of the loop, `nums` will be a list containing the integers 2 through 16384, inclusive, followed by three specific elements based on the value of `k`. These elements are `k - 64`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[3] + 1`, which simplifies to `k + 16 + 1` or `k + 17`. The variable `idx` will be set to 3 after the loop completes.

In summary, the final `nums` list will contain the integers from 2 to 16384, inclusive, along with the three specific elements derived from `k`, and `idx` will be 3.
