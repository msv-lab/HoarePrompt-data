Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. In such cases, even though `n-1` bridges can be destroyed, leaving only one bridge intact, the program incorrectly prints `1` instead of the correct answer, which should be `2` (since island 1 and at least one other island remain reachable).

For example, consider the case where `n = 3` and `k = 2`. According to the problem description, destroying 2 bridges would leave at least one bridge intact, allowing Everule to visit both island 1 and another island. However, the program incorrectly outputs `1`.

To fix this, the program should check if `k >= n - 1` and return `2` in such cases. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

This ensures that the program correctly handles all potential cases according to the problem description.
