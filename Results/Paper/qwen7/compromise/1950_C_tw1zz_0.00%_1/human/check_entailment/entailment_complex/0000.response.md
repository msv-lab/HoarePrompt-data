Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, splitting the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. The program attempts to convert the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format by mapping the hours from 00 to 23 to their corresponding 12-hour format values, appending "AM" or "PM" accordingly.
4. However, the logic for converting the hours can be simplified and is unnecessarily verbose. Instead of using multiple `if-elif` statements, we can use the modulo operation to handle the conversion more efficiently.
5. Despite the verbose and inefficient approach, the program correctly handles all edge cases (e.g., "00" is correctly converted to "12 PM").
6. The output format matches the required format: "h1:mm AM/PM".

Despite the inefficiency and redundancy in the code, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
