Reasoning:
1. The program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. It correctly handles the conversion for both AM and PM times.
3. However, the logic for converting hours is inefficient and repetitive, using many `elif` statements instead of a more concise approach.
4. Despite this inefficiency, the program correctly maps each 24-hour hour to its 12-hour equivalent and appends the correct AM/PM indicator.
5. The program correctly processes multiple test cases as specified.
6. The output format matches the required format exactly, including handling leading zeros for hours.

Given these points, the program does indeed perform the required task correctly, even though the implementation could be optimized.

Correctness: **True**
