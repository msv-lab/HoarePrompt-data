Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for times starting with '12'. Specifically, the program fails to correctly convert '12:xx' to '12:xx PM' and '00:xx' to '12:xx AM'. Here are the issues:

1. For `12:00`, the program incorrectly converts it to `12:00 PM` instead of `12:00 AM`.
2. For `00:59`, the program incorrectly converts it to `12:59 AM` instead of `12:59 PM`.

These issues indicate that the program does not handle the transition between AM and PM correctly for the boundary conditions of 12 and 00. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.
