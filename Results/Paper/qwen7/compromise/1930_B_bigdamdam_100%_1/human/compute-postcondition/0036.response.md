Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `p[0]` is `n`, `ind` is `n - 2`, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the first element which is `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is decremented by 2. Initially, `ind` was equal to `n`. After decrementing, `ind` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
