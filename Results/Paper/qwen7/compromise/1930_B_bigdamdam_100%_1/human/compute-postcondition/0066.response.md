Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `range(0, n, 2)`, meaning `i` starts from 0 and increments by 2 until it reaches a value less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ind` is `n-2`
   - `i` is 8
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0
   - `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros
   - `p[8]` is `n`

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is currently 8 and the loop increments by 2, the next value of `i` would be `10` if `n` allows it.

5. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 10) must be less than `n`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` should be set to 10.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `p` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `p[8]` remains `n` as it is not directly affected by the loop.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ind` is `n-2`, `i` is 10, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `p[8]` is `n`**
