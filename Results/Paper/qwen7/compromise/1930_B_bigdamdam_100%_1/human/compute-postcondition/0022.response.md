Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1000; `i` is 3; `p[3]` is `ind`**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` assigns the value of `ind` to the index `i` in the list `p`. Given that `i` is 3, the value of `p[3]` is now `ind`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1000 remains unchanged, and the value of `i` also remains 3.
