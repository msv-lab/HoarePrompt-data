Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `p[0]` is `n`, `ind` is `n`, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the first element which is `n`.**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = ind` updates the list `p` such that the element at index `i` (which is 0) is set to the value of `ind` (which is `n`). All other values in the list `p` remain as zeros since no other elements were modified.
