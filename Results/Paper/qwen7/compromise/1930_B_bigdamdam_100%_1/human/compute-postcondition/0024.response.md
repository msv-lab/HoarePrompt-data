Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the step value `2`. However, since the step value is constant and does not change within the loop, we only need to consider `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1000.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `p[3]` is `ind`.
   - `ind` is 5.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n, 2)`, which means `i` should be incremented by 2 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `3 + 2 = 5`.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is now 5, we need to check if `5 < n`.
   - Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1000, `5 < n` is always true for `n >= 1000`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 5.
   - `n` remains the same (must be greater than or equal to 1000).
   - `p[3]` and `ind` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1000, `i` is 5**
