Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `p[0]` is `n`
   - `ind` is `n - 4`
   - `p[2]` is `n - 2`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Given that `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2 (the step size in the range function).

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 2 and increments by 2 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `2 + 2 = 4`.

5. **Determine the new condition for `n`**: For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - The values of `p[0]`, `ind`, and `p[2]` are derived from `n` and do not change based on the loop iteration itself, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `p[0]` is `n`, `ind` is `n - 4`, `p[2]` is `n - 2`**
