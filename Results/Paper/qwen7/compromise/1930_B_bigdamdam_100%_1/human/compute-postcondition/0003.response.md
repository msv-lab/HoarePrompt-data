Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `p` is a list of n zeros, `ind` is n.**

Explanation: The line `ind = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `ind`. The values of `t`, `i`, `p`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
