Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1000; `i` is `n-1`; `p[i]` is `ind + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`; `ind` is `1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` by 2 each iteration until `i` reaches `n-1`. Since `n` is always greater than or equal to 1000, the loop will run exactly `((n-1)//2)` times. Each iteration sets `p[i]` to the current value of `ind`, which starts at 1 and increases by 2 with each iteration. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, `p[i]` will be `1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`, and `ind` will also be `1 + 2 * ((n-1)//2)`.
