Postcondition: **`ops` is a list containing the tuple `(l, r)`, `s` is the sum of the element `r - l + 1` repeated `r - l + 1` times, and `a` is a list where all elements from index `l` to index `r` are set to `r - l + 1` if `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. Otherwise, `mx` remains the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` remains the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive, `a` remains a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ops` includes the operation `s = sum(a[l:r + 1])`, and if `pos != r`, `pos` is incremented by 1 and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with the new position `pos + 1` and the end index `r`.**
