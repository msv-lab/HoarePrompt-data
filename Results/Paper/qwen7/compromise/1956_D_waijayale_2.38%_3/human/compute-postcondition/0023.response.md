The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and implicitly a list `a` (since it is not explicitly defined in the function signature but mentioned in the constraints). The parameters `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= n`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`. The list `a` contains non-negative integers with lengths ranging from 1 to 18 and each element in the list is between 0 and \(10^7\).

The function aims to perform a series of operations to maximize the sum of the subarray defined by indices `l` to `r` in the list `a`. The operations are stored in a list called `ops`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `l` and `r`, and an implicit list `a`. It returns the maximum sum of the subarray defined by indices `l` to `r` in the list `a` after performing a series of operations stored in `ops`.**
