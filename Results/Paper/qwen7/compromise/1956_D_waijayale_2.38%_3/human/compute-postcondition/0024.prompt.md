You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7. l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n. ops is a list that will store the sequence of operations performed.
def recursive_maximize_sum(l, r):
    s = sum(a[l:r + 1])
    if (s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)) :
        func_1(a, l, r, ops)
        ops.append((l, r))
        for i in range(l, r + 1):
            a[i] = r - l + 1
            
        #State: Output State: `ops` is now a list containing the tuple `(l, r)`, `s` is the sum of the element `r - l + 1` repeated `r - l + 1` times, and `a` is a list where all elements from index `l` to index `r` are set to `r - l + 1`.
    else :
        mx = max(a[l:r + 1])
        pos = a[l:r + 1].index(mx) + l
        if (pos != l) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)
        #State: `mx` remains the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` remains the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive, `a` remains a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ops` includes the operation `s = sum(a[l:r + 1])`, and either `pos` is the index of the maximum value `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` adjusted by `l` (if `pos != l` and `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called), or `pos` remains unchanged (if `pos == l`).
        if (pos != r) :
            recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)
        #State: Postcondition: `mx` remains the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` remains the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive, `a` remains a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ops` includes the operation `s = sum(a[l:r + 1])`, and if `pos != r`, `pos` is incremented by 1 and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with the new position `pos + 1` and the end index `r`.
    #State: `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(l, r)`, `s` is the sum of the element `r - l + 1` repeated `r - l + 1` times, and `a` is a list where all elements from index `l` to index `r` are set to `r - l + 1` if `s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. Otherwise, `mx` remains the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` remains the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive, `a` remains a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ops` includes the operation `s = sum(a[l:r + 1])`, and if `pos != r`, `pos` is incremented by 1 and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with the new position `pos + 1` and the end index `r`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `l` and `r`, and an implicit list `a`. It returns the maximum sum of the subarray defined by indices `l` to `r` in the list `a` after performing a series of operations stored in `ops`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
