Output State: **`mx` remains the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` remains the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive, `a` remains a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ops` includes the operation `s = sum(a[l:r + 1])`, `pos` is the index of the maximum value `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` adjusted by `l`, and `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` calls the function `recursive_maximize_sum` with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`. This does not directly change the values of `mx`, `s`, `a`, `ops`, or `pos`. It only initiates a recursive call. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
