Postcondition: `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive; `a` remains a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7; `ops` is a list that includes the operation `s = sum(a[l:r + 1])`. If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, then `ops` is updated to contain the tuple `(l, r)`, and `s` is set to the sum of `r - l + 1` repeated `r - l + 1` times, with all elements from index `l` to index `r` in `a` being set to `r - l + 1`. Otherwise, `mx` remains the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` remains unchanged, and if `pos` is not equal to `r`, `pos` is incremented by 1 and the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with the new position `pos + 1` and the end index `r`.
