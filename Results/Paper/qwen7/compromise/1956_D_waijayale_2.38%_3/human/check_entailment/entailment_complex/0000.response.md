Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is responsible for setting all elements within a specified range `[l, r]` to the value `r - l + 1` and recording the operation. It correctly handles the base case when `l == r` by setting the value to 0 if it's not already 0. For the general case, it ensures that all elements in the range are set to the correct value and records the operation.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calculates the sum of the array and the operations required to maximize the sum. It uses `func_1` to perform the necessary operations. The logic is sound: it checks if the current sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\). If true, it sets all elements in the subarray to \(r - l + 1\). Otherwise, it finds the maximum element and recursively processes the subarrays before and after the position of the maximum element. This ensures that the sum is maximized.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**: This function is a helper function used by `func_2` to maximize the sum of a subarray. It correctly identifies the maximum element and processes the subarrays accordingly. The logic is consistent with the problem requirements.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads input, calls `func_2` to get the required outputs, and prints them along with the operations. The logic is straightforward and correctly implements the required functionality.

Given that all functions work as intended and collectively meet the problem requirements, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
