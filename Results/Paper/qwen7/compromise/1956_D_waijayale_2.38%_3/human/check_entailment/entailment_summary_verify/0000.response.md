### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array elements using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Function Summaries**:
   - `func_3()` reads the input, calls `func_2()`, and prints the results.
   - `func_2()` computes the sum, maximum value, and operations needed.
   - `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)` tries to maximize the sum of the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - `func_1(a, l, r, ops)` sets the subarray from `l` to `r` to the MEX value and records the operation.

3. **Analysis of `func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
   - This function recursively ensures that the subarray from `l` to `r` is filled with the MEX value.
   - If `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it calls itself recursively on the right subarray and updates the leftmost element to the MEX value, then records the operation.

4. **Analysis of `recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
   - This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\), it sets the entire subarray to the MEX value and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and recursively maximizes the sum on both sides of the maximum value.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program seems to follow a strategy to maximize the sum by ensuring that each subarray is filled with the smallest possible value that maximizes the sum while respecting the MEX constraint.
   - The recursive approach ensures that the subarrays are processed in a way that maximizes the sum efficiently.

6. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the input `[0, 1]`:
     - The expected output is `4 1`.
     - The program correctly sets the subarray to `[2, 2]` and achieves the maximum sum.
   - For the input `[1, 3, 9]`:
     - The expected output is `13 0`.
     - The program correctly identifies that no operations are needed since the array is already optimal.
   - For the input `[1, 100, 2, 1]`:
     - The expected output is `105 2`.
     - The program correctly sets the subarray from index 3 to 3 to 2 and then from index 3 to 4 to 2.

Given the analysis and verification, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements while adhering to the MEX constraint.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements using the MEX constraint.
