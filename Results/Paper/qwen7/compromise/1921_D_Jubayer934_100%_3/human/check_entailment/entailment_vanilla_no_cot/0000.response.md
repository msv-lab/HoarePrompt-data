Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Choosing Elements**: The logic for choosing elements from `b` to maximize the difference is flawed. It doesn't ensure that the differences are maximized correctly.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Elements**: After selecting the initial `n` elements, the code doesn't handle the remaining elements in `b` properly to maximize the total difference.
3. **Unnecessary Variables**: Some variables like `temp` are not used correctly and can be removed to simplify the code.

### Corrected Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible difference
        max_diff = 0
        for i in range(n):
            max_diff += abs(a[i] - b[i])
        
        # If there are more elements in b than needed, add the maximum possible difference from the remaining elements
        if m > n:
            max_diff += sum(b[n:])
        
        print(max_diff)

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. Sort `a` and `b` in ascending and descending order, respectively.
2. Calculate the initial difference by pairing the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `b`, and so on.
3. If there are more elements in `b` than needed, add the maximum possible difference from the remaining elements of `b`.

This approach ensures that the total difference is maximized correctly.
