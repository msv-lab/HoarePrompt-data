Reasoning:

The annotated program seems to correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference \(D\) between the arrays \(a\) and \(b\). Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\), followed by the arrays \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Sorting Arrays**: The program sorts both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) in ascending and descending orders, respectively. This ensures that when we compare elements, we can maximize the differences by pairing the smallest element of \(a\) with the largest element of \(b\) and vice versa.

3. **Calculating Differences**: The program iterates through the first \(n\) elements of the sorted arrays and calculates the absolute differences. It checks if swapping the current pair (i.e., using \(b[-(n - i)]\) instead of \(b[i]\)) would result in a larger difference. If such a swap is found, it updates the index `temp`.

4. **Constructing the Result Array**: After determining the optimal pairs, the program constructs the result array `ans` by appending the calculated differences. If a swap was found (`temp != -1`), it appends the remaining differences starting from the index `temp`.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly compute the maximum total difference \(D\) as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
