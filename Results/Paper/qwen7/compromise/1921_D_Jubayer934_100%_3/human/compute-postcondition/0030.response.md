Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `temp`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` contains the value `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`
   - `i` is `temp`
   - `temp` must be less than `n`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `temp` to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `temp`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `temp + 1`.
   - Since `i` starts from `temp` and goes up to `n`, `temp` can remain the same as it is the starting point of the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged because the calculation of `ans` is done outside the loop.
   - `i` is now `temp + 1`.
   - `temp` must still be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` contains the value `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`, `i` is `temp + 1`, `temp` must be less than `n`**
