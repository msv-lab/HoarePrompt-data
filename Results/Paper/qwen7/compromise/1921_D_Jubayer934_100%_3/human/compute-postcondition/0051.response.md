Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The list `ans` is updated with the new value.
