Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `temp` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is initially 0, the code calculates `abs(a[0] - b[0])` and appends this value to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
