Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `i + 1`, `ans` is a list with one additional element which is the absolute difference between `a[temp - 1]` and `b[temp - 1]` appended, `ans` now includes the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions. The value of `n`, `temp`, and the structure of `ans` are updated accordingly.
