Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers; `b` is a list of integers; `temp` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `temp` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 0, `n` is still greater than 0, `a` is still a list of integers, `b` is still a list of integers, and `temp` is now 0.
