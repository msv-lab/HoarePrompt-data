Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `temp` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `temp`. Since `i` was initially 1, `temp` is now also 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
