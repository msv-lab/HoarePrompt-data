Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `temp` is less than `n`.
- The list `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element in `a` and the corresponding element in `b` from index `temp` to `n-1` in ascending order.

The `print(sum(ans))` statement will calculate and print the sum of all elements in the list `ans`.

To break it down further:
- `ans` is a list of absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` starting from index `temp` to `n-1`.
- Since `ans` is sorted in ascending order, it contains the sorted absolute differences.
- The `sum(ans)` function will add up all these absolute differences.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` from index `temp` to `n-1`.

Output: **sum of absolute differences between elements of a and b from index temp to n-1**
