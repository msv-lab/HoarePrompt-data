Output State: **`ans` contains the value `abs(a[temp] - b[-(n - temp)])`, `i` is `temp`, `temp` must be less than `n`**.

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[temp]` and `b[-(n - temp)]` to the list `ans`. Since `i` was equal to `temp` before the code execution, `i` remains `temp`. The condition that `temp` must be less than `n` is still valid. The value of `ans` is updated with the new element, but no other variables are affected.
