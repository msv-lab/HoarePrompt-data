Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Understand the Input**: The input is an integer `t` such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`. This means the loop will run `t` times.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will run based on the input value `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range. The initial state mentions that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`.

4. **Final State Adjustment**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer within the given range. Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a valid value before the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
