Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `temp` is -1, and `ans` contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid `i` in the range `[0, n]`. If `temp` is not `-1`, `ans` includes `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` for all valid `i` in the range `[temp, n]`**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `m` from input using `map(int, input().split())`. This operation does not affect the existing values of `i`, `temp`, and `ans`. Therefore, `i` remains `n + 1`, `temp` remains `-1`, and `ans` retains its original definition.
