Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `temp` is `-1`, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and `b` in order from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`.

This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`, meaning the loop has iterated over all elements in the range `n`. The variable `temp` remains `-1` because no break condition was met within the loop. The list `ans` contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`, calculated for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`.
