Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, `temp` is `i`.**

Explanation: The line `temp = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `n + 1`) to the variable `temp`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
