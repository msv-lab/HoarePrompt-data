Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `temp` is -1, and `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `ans` as an empty list. This means that `ans` no longer contains the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid `i` in the range `[0, n]`. Instead, it is now an empty list. The values of `n`, `m`, and `temp` remain unchanged.
