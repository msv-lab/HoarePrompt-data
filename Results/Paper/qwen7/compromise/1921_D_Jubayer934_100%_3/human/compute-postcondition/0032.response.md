Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(temp, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `temp`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `temp + 1` and `temp` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value (`temp + 1`).
   - Therefore, `i` will become `temp + 2`.
   - Since `temp` is less than `n`, `temp + 1` is also less than `n`, and thus `temp + 2` will also be less than `n` as long as `temp + 2 < n`.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to `temp + 2`.

**Final State**:
State: **`ans` now contains the value `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`, `i` is `temp + 2`, `temp` is less than `n`**
