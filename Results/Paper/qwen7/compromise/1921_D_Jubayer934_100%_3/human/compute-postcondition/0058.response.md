Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` appended with the absolute difference of `a[i]` and `b[i]`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, the loop will not execute because `i` is not less than `n`.
   - Therefore, we cannot proceed to the next iteration with the current values of `i` and `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop does not execute, there is no change in the value of `i`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - The list `ans` remains unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration (which won't happen) would remain the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` appended with the absolute difference of `a[i]` and `b[i]`**
