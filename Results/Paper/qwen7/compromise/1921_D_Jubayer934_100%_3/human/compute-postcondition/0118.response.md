Output State: The loop has executed for all test cases, and for each test case, `temp` either holds the index where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was last true (if such an index exists) or remains `-1` if the condition was never met. The list `ans` contains the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b` for all valid `i` in the range `[temp, n-1]` if `temp` is not `-1`, otherwise it contains the sum of the absolute differences for all valid `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. The variable `i` is equal to `n` after the loop completes for each test case.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `temp` will hold the index where the specified condition was last true or will be `-1` if the condition was never met. The list `ans` will contain the total sum of the absolute differences between the elements of lists `a` and `b` as described above.
