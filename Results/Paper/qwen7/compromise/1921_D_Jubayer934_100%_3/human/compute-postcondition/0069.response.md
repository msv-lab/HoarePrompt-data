Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(temp, n)`. The key variables here are `i`, `temp`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` now contains `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])`.
   - `i` is at least `temp` but less than `n`.
   - `temp` is not -1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least `temp` but less than `n`.

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop can continue if `i + 1 < n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making it `i + 1`.
   - `temp` remains unchanged because it is the starting point of the loop and does not change within the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper bound of the loop and does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `ans` will contain `abs(a[i + 1] - b[-(n - (i + 1))])` in the next iteration.
   - `temp` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the same.

Given these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` now contains `abs(a[i + 1] - b[-(n - (i + 1))])`, `i` is at least `temp` but less than `n`, `temp` is not -1, `n` must be greater than 0**.
