Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` appended to the previous list, and `temp` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Since no changes were made to `i`, `n`, or `temp`, their values remain the same as the initial state. The only change is that `ans` now includes the new value of the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
