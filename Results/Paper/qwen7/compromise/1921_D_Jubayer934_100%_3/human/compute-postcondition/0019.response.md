Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `temp` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and `ans` also contains the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to the list `ans`. Initially, `i` is 1, so the first element added to `ans` is `abs(a[1] - b[1])`. After this operation, `i` is incremented (though not shown in the snippet, it's implied by the context), making `i` equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
