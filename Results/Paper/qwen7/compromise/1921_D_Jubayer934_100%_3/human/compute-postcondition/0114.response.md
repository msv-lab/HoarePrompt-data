Output State: `i` is equal to `temp + (n - temp)`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list with `n - temp` elements, where each element is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for `i` ranging from `temp` to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `temp + (n - temp)`, meaning it has iterated through all indices from `temp` to `n-1`. The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences between corresponding elements of arrays `a` and `b`, starting from index `temp` up to `n-1`, with each difference appended to the list in the order they were calculated.
