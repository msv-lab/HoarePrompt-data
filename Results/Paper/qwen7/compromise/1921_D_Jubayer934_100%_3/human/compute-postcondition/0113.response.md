Output State: `i` is equal to `temp + (n - temp)`, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is a list with `n - temp` elements, where each element is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` for `i` ranging from `temp` to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the last index `temp + (n - temp)` that the loop processed. The variable `n` remains greater than 0. The list `ans` will contain the absolute differences calculated for each index from `temp` to `n-1`, making it a total of `n - temp` elements in the list.
