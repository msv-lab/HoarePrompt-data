Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0. If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as the one described in the if part.
