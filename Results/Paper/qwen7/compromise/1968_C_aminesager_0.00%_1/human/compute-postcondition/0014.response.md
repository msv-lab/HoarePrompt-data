Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a` is a list where each element `a[j]` (for `j` in the range of `n`) is calculated as `a[j] = 1000 - sum(T[0:j])`. This means that `a[j]` starts with 1000 and decreases by the cumulative sum of the first `j` elements of list `T` for each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-1`, `n` must still be greater than 1, and the list `a` will contain `n` elements. The first element `a[0]` will be `1000 - T[0]`, the second element `a[1]` will be `1000 - (T[0] + T[1])`, and so on, with the last element `a[n-1]` being `1000 - sum(T)`.
