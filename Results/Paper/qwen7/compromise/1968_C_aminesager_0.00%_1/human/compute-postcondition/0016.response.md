The code `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` does the following:
- It applies the `map` function to convert each element in the list `a` to a string.
- It then joins these string elements with a space (' ') as the separator.
- The resulting string is assigned to the variable `result`.

Since the list `a` is defined as `[1000 - sum(T), 1000 - (T[0] + T[1]), ..., 1000 - sum(T)]` reversed, and `i` is `n-1`, the value of `i` remains unchanged because no operation modifies it. The list `a` itself is transformed into a string representation but does not change its content.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and the list `a` is represented as a space-separated string of its elements, each being a string conversion of `1000 - sum(T)` reversed.**
