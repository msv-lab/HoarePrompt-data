Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `t` is `t-1`, and the list `a` is represented as a space-separated string of its elements, each being a string conversion of `1000 - sum(T)` reversed.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making `t` equal to `t-1`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` remains as originally defined.
