Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list with one element which is `a[0]` equal to `a[0-1] - T[0-1]` or simply `a[0]` equal to `0 - T[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `a`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[0]`, and `T[i - 1]` refers to `T[0]`. Since `a[0]` does not exist yet, it is assumed to be 0 (as it is the first element being added). Thus, the new element appended to `a` is `0 - T[0]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
