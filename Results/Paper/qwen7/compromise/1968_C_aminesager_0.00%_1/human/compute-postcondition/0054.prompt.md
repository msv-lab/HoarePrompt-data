You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        line = input('')
        
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        
        a = [1000]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        
        a = a[::-1]
        
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to decrement `t` until `t` reaches 0. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the variable `n` will be the value it had in the last iteration of the loop. The list `a` will contain the final computed values based on the cumulative subtraction of elements in `T`. Specifically, `a` will be constructed such that each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-2`) represents the difference between `T[j]` and the accumulated value from previous elements in `a`.
    #
    #The `result` will be a string representation of the list `a` with elements separated by spaces. The `line` variable will hold the input string from the last iteration, and `T` will be an empty list since it gets reassigned to an empty list at the end of each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), and a list x of n-1 integers (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, the function determines and returns some unspecified outcome based on the given t, n, and x.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
