Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: Initially, `t` is set to `t - 1`. After executing `n = int(input())`, the value of `t` is further decremented by 1, making it `t - 2`. The value of `n` is assigned the integer value of the input provided by the user, and no other variables are affected.
