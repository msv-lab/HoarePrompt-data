Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is `[1000, a[n-3] - T[n-3], a[i-1] - (a[i-1] - T[i-1])]`, `result` is an empty string, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be non-zero, `line` is the input string, `T` is an empty list**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new element to the list `a`. The new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.
- Given that `i` is `n-1`, the expression simplifies to `a[n-1 - 1] - T[n-1 - 1]`, which is `a[n-2] - T[n-2]`.
- Therefore, the updated list `a` becomes `[1000, a[n-3] - T[n-3], a[n-2] - T[n-2]]`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
