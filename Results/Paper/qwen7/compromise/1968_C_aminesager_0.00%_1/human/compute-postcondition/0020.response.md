Output State: **`i` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, and the list `a` is represented as a space-separated string of its elements, each being a string conversion of `1000 - sum(T)` reversed.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `i` is updated to `n - 1`, and the value of `t` remains unchanged as `t-1`. The list `a` is described based on its initial state, which does not get updated by this line of code.
