Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` has an additional element which is equal to `a[2] - T[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` appends a new element to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[2]` and `T[i - 1]` refers to `T[2]`. Since `a` and `T` are not defined in the initial state, we assume they are lists. The new element added to `a` is the result of `a[2] - T[2]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
