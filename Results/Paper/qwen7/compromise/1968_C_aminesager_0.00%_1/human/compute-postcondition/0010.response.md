Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is updated by appending the value of `a[1] - T[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` appends to the list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression becomes `a[1] - T[1]`. The initial state of `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1, which remains unchanged. The list `a` is updated by appending the calculated value.
