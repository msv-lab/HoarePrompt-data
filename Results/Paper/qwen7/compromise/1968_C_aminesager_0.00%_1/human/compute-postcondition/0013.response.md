Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a` is a list where each element `a[j]` (for `j` in the range of `n`) is calculated as `a[j] = 1000 - sum(T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[j-1])`. This means that `a[j]` is initialized to 1000 and then decreases by the cumulative sum of the elements in `T` up to index `j-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, `n` must still be greater than 1, and `a` will contain `n` elements starting from 1000, decreasing by the cumulative sum of the elements in `T` at each step.
