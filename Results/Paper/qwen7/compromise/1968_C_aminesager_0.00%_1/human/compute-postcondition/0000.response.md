Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input function will return an integer, the updated state of `t` is an input integer within the specified range. The other variables (`n` and `x`) remain unaffected by this line of code.
