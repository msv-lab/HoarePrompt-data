Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is an input integer, `line` is an input string from the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` by spaces and converting each part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` splits the string `line` by spaces and converts each part into an integer, then assigns the resulting list to `T`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `line` remain unchanged from their initial states.
