Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list with one element, where `a[0]` equals `0 - T[0]`.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 1 (which it already is).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - The state of `a` does not change because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1**
