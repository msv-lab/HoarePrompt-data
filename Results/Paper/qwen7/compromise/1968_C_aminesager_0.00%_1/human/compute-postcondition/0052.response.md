Output State: The loop will continue to decrement `t` until `t` reaches 0. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the variable `n` will be the value it had in the last iteration of the loop. The list `a` will contain the final computed values based on the cumulative subtraction of elements in `T`. Specifically, `a` will be constructed such that each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-2`) represents the difference between `T[j]` and the accumulated value from previous elements in `a`.

The `result` will be a string representation of the list `a` with elements separated by spaces. The `line` variable will hold the input string from the last iteration, and `T` will be an empty list since it gets reassigned to an empty list at the end of each iteration.
