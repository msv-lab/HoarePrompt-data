Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `2`
   - `a` has an element appended which is the value of `a[1] - T[1]`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `2`, the loop will increment `i` by `1` to `3`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than `3`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `3`.
   - `n` must be greater than `3`.
   - The state of `a` remains unchanged as the loop body is omitted.

Based on this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
