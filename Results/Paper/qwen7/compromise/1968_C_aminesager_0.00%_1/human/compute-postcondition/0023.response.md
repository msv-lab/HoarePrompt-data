Output State: **`i` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t-1`, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string `line` and converting each part to an integer, `a` is a list containing the integer 1000.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with the single element 1000. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `t`, `T`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
