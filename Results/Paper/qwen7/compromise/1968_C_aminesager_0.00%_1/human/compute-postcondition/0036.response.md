Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than the input integer, `a` is a list where the first element `a[0]` is `1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])`, and every subsequent element `a[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n-2`) is `a[j-1] - T[j-1]`, and the list `a` is reversed; `result` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `a` with spaces; `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be non-zero.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is decremented by 1, so `t` becomes `t - 1`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
