You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        a = a[::-1]
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list `x` + 1), and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then constructs a list `a` where each element is derived from the cumulative subtraction of elements in `x`. Finally, it prints a string representation of the list `a` with elements separated by spaces. After processing all test cases, the function ends.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `T`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the list `a` with a single element `[1000]`. This is the starting point for the sequence.

3. **Building the Sequence:**
   - For each element in the sequence from index 1 to `n-1`, the program calculates the next value in the sequence.
   - Specifically, for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it sets `a[i]` to `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.

4. **Reversing the List:**
   - After constructing the sequence, the program reverses the list `a`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the reversed list `a` as a space-separated string.

### Correctness Check

To check the correctness, let's consider the problem constraints and the example provided:

#### Example 1:
- Test Case: `n = 4`, `x = [2, 4, 1]`
- Expected Output: `3 5 4 9`

Let's verify the sequence construction:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = a[0] - x[0] = 1000 - 2 = 998`
- `a[2] = a[1] - x[1] = 998 - 4 = 994`
- `a[3] = a[2] - x[2] = 994 - 1 = 993`

Reversing the list gives us `993, 994, 998, 1000`. However, this does not match the expected output `3 5 4 9`.

#### Example 2:
- Test Case: `n = 3`, `x = [1, 1]`
- Expected Output: `2 5 11`

Let's verify the sequence construction:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = a[0] - x[0] = 1000 - 1 = 999`
- `a[2] = a[1] - x[1] = 999 - 1 = 998`

Reversing the list gives us `998, 999, 1000`. This does not match the expected output `2 5 11`.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly construct the sequence `a` that satisfies the conditions specified in the problem. The logic used to generate the sequence is flawed, and the output does not match the expected results for the provided examples.
