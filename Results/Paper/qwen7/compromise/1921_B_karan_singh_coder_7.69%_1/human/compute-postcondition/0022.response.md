Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the total count of positions where the characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`, `t1` remains the number of '1' characters in the string `s`, `s` is a newly input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes an input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The other variables (`n`, `cnt`, `t1`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
