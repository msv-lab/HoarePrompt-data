Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the total count of positions where the characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`, `t1` remains the number of '1' characters in the string `s`, `s` is updated to the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string.**

Explanation: The code `t = input()` reads a new string from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, `cnt`, `t1`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `s` is updated to the newly input string, and `t` now holds the newly input string.
