Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the total count of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, `t` is a newly input string, `t1` is updated to the count of '1' characters in the string `t`.**

Explanation: The code `t1 = t.count('1')` updates the value of `t1` to be the count of '1' characters in the string `t`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
