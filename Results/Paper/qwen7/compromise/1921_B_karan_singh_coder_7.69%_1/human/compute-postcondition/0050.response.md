Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 0
- `cnt` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0
- `n` must be greater than 0 (since the loop starts from 0)

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `cnt` is either 1 or 0 based on the condition `s[0] != t[0]`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0, the first iteration will set `i` to 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

### Updated States:
- `i` will be incremented to 1.
- `cnt` remains unchanged because it depends on the initial condition `s[0] != t[0]`.
- `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `cnt` is 1 if `s[0]` is not equal to `t[0]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
