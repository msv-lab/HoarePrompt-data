Output State: **`cnt` is 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `t`, otherwise `cnt` is 0; `t1` is the number of '1' characters in the string `s`; `t` is an input integer; `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `t`. Otherwise, it does not change `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
