Output State: **`cnt` is 2, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`, `s` is updated to the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string, `i` is 2**

Explanation: The code `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` increments `cnt` by 1 if the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at the same index in `t`. Initially, `cnt` is 1. After the first iteration (assuming `i` starts from 1), `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the condition `s[i] != t[i]` is true. Since `i` is set to 1 initially, if the first characters of `s` and `t` are different, `cnt` becomes 2. The values of `s1`, `t1`, `s`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `i` is incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
