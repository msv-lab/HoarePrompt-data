Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user, while the variable `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 is still valid.
