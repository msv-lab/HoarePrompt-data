Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the second and third lines are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1' characters representing the initial and final states of the boxes, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    s1 = s.count('1')
    t1 = t.count('1')
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        cnt += s[i] != t[i]
    if s1 == t1:
        print(s1 if cnt else 0)
    else:
        d = abs(s1 - t1)
        print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt` will be the total count of positions where the characters in string `s` do not match the corresponding characters in string `t`. `t1` remains the number of '1' characters in the string `s`, `n` is the input integer, and `s` is the string input by the user. The variable `i` will be `n` after the loop completes. If `s1` equals `t1`, then `d` is 0. Otherwise, `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cnt` is the total count of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`. If `s1` equals `t1`, `cnt` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cnt` is updated based on the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`, and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the total number of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ. If `s1` equals `t1`, the function does not change `cnt`. If `s1` is not equal to `t1`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 and `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
