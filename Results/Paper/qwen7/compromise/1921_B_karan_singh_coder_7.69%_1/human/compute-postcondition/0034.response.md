Output State: `cnt` is 6, `s1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `s`, `t1` is the count of '1' characters in the string `t`, `s` is updated to the newly input string, `t` is the newly input string, `i` is 4.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., for each index from 0 to n-1), the variable `cnt` will hold the total count of positions where the characters in strings `s` and `t` differ. The counts of '1' characters in strings `s` and `t` (`s1` and `t1`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The strings `s` and `t` are also not altered within the loop, so their values remain as they were updated outside the loop. The loop variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the last iteration, but since it's not listed among the final states, we can infer it's just beyond the last index processed.
