Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each round has at least one problem of each difficulty level. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the number of rounds `m` can be greater than the number of distinct difficulty levels present in the input string `s`. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
10 2
BGECDCBDED
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```

The program outputs:
```
2
5
1
```

However, the correct outputs should be:
- For the first test case, since `m = 1`, we need at most 2 additional problems (one 'A' and one 'F').
- For the second test case, since `m = 2`, we need at least 5 additional problems (one 'A', one 'E', one 'F', and two more problems to cover the remaining rounds).
- For the third test case, since `m = 1` and we only need one problem, no additional problems are needed.

The program fails to handle the scenario where `m` is greater than the number of unique difficulty levels in the input string. It incorrectly calculates the number of additional problems needed without considering the requirement that each round must have at least one problem of each difficulty level.
