### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually using a while loop.
2. **Default Dictionary Initialization**: The use of `defaultdict(default_value)` is incorrect because `default_value` is not defined. It should be initialized with an appropriate default value, such as `0`.
3. **Problem Count Calculation**: The program counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string `s` using a dictionary `d`. This part is correct.
4. **Answer Calculation**: The logic for calculating the minimum number of additional problems needed is flawed. The current implementation checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m` and adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`. However, this approach does not account for the fact that each round requires one problem of each difficulty level, and it should consider the total required problems across all rounds.
5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is correct.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect initialization of the default dictionary and the flawed logic for calculating the minimum number of additional problems, the program is **incorrect**.

### Corrected Program:

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Initialize with 0 as the default value
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Final Response:

Correctness: **False**
