Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each containing an integer result based on the value of `k` relative to `n`. For each test case, if `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, the output is `math.ceil(k / 2)`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 3`, the output is `2 * n - 1`. If `k` equals `4 * n - 2`, the output is `2 * n`. The number of lines in the output state is equal to the number of test cases provided in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the relationship between \( k \) and \( 4n - 2 \). If \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). If \( k = 4n - 3 \), it prints \( 2n - 1 \). If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it prints \( 2n \). The function reads these values from standard input and outputs the results to standard output, with one line per test case.
