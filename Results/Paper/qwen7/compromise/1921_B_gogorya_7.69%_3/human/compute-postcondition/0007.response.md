Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the value entered by the user as a string, `s2` is a string input by the user, `a1` is the number of '1's in the string `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1's in the string `s2`, `hd` is the difference between `a1` and `a2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a1 - a2` to the variable `hd`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variable `hd` is created and holds the difference between `a1` and `a2`.
