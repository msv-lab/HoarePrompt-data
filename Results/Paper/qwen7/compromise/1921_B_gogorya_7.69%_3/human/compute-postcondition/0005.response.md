Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is the value entered by the user as a string, `s2` is a string input by the user, `a1` is the number of '1's in the string `s1`.**

Explanation: The code `a1 = s1.count('1')` counts the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `s1` and assigns this count to the variable `a1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
