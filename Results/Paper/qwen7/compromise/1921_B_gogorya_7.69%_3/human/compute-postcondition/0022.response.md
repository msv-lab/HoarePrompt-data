Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `hd` is -1**.

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the scope of the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the conditions and values of `n`, `i`, and `hd` stay the same.
