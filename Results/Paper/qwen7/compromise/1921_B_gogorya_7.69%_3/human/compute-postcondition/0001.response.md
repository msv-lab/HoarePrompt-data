State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is not relevant as it is a throwaway variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` and the throwaway variable `_`.
- The throwaway variable `_` is used in the loop but does not affect the loop's execution condition.
- The variable `t` determines whether the loop will execute. For the loop to run, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 to 10^4).

Therefore, the state that needs adjustment is `t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4.
