Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `hd` is 0 (not part of the loop head)
   - `res` is 1 if `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0', otherwise `res` remains unchanged (not part of the loop head)

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` becomes 3
   - `n` must still be greater than 0
   - `hd` remains unchanged (0)
   - `res` remains unchanged based on the condition `s1[2]` and `s2[2]`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `hd` is 0, and `res` is 1 if `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0'. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
