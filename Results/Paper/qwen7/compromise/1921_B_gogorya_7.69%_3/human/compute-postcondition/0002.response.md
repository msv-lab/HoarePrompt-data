Output State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially described to be an integer between 1 and 10^4. The variable `_` is not relevant as it is mentioned to be a throwaway variable.
