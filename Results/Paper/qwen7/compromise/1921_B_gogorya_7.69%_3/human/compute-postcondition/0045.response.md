Output State: **`i` is `n`, `hd` is `a1 - a2`, `res` is `abs(a1 - a2)`, `s2` is an input string, `a1` is the number of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1's in `s2`, `t` is `t + 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` to be the absolute difference between `a1` and `a2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
