Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `hd` is -1, and `res` remains unchanged.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables `i`, `n`, `hd`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state retains the same values as the initial state.
