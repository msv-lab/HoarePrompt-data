Output State: `temp` is 'aamo', `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `cases` is 3.

Explanation: After analyzing the loop and the given states, we can conclude that the loop runs exactly 3 times. The variable `i` remains at 4 because it is not incremented within the loop body. The variable `j` reaches 3 after 3 iterations. The variable `temp` concatenates characters derived from `info[i][j] + 96`, resulting in the string 'aamo'. Since the loop runs exactly 3 times, `cases` must be 3, and there are no further iterations to consider. Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is `temp` being 'aamo', `i` remaining 4, `j` at 3, and `cases` being 3.
