Output State: **`temp` is 'aamo', `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` by appending the character corresponding to the index `info[i][j] + 96`. Given that `i` is 5 and `j` is 3, `info[5][3]` is used to find the character. Assuming `info[5][3]` corresponds to the letter 'm' (as per typical ASCII values), the character `chr(109 + 96)` is 'm'. Therefore, `temp` becomes 'aam' + 'm' = 'aamo'. The values of `i` and `j` are decremented by 1 due to the nature of list indexing, making `i` 4. The value of `cases` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
