Output State: **`temp` is 'abcdef', `i` is 4, `j` is 5**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` by concatenating it with a character derived from the expression `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 4 and `j` is 5. Assuming `info` is a list of lists where `info[4][5]` evaluates to 1 (since `chr(1 + 96)` is 'a'), `temp` becomes 'abcde' + 'f' = 'abcdef'. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
