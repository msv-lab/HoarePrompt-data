Output State: **`lex` is an integer with a value greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52; `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

Explanation: The code appends the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Since `lex` was initially an integer with a value greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, its value remains unchanged. The list `arr` now contains the element 26.
