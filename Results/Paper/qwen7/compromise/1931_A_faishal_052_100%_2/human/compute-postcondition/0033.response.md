Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is now [26], `lex` is `lex` - 26, and `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `lex = lex - 26` subtracts 26 from the current value of `lex`. Since `lex` was an input integer with a value less than or equal to 52, after subtracting 26, the new value of `lex` will be `lex - 26`. All other variables (`i`, `cases`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
