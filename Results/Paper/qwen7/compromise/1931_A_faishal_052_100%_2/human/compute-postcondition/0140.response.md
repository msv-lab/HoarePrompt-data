Postcondition: `j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26`, and `arr` contains the following elements:
- If `lex` was less than 27, `arr` contains the elements [1, 1] if `lex` is now less than 27, or [1, 26] if `lex` is now between 27 and 52 (exclusive).
- If `lex` was between 27 and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the value 26 and 1 if `lex` is now less than 27, or the value 26 if `lex` is now between 27 and 52 (exclusive).
- If `lex` was 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged and contains the element 1.
