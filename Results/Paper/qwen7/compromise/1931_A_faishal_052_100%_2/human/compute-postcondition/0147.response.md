Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26` depending on the initial value of `lex`, if `lex` was less than 27, `arr` contains the elements [26, 1] or [26, 26], if `lex` was between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the elements [26, 26] or [26, 1], if `lex` was 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged and contains the element [26]**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, the list `arr` will have different configurations:
- If `lex` was less than 27, `arr` would initially contain [1, 1] or [1, 26]. After appending `26`, it becomes [26, 1] or [26, 26].
- If `lex` was between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` would initially contain [26, 1] or [26]. After appending `26`, it becomes [26, 26] or [26, 1].
- If `lex` was 52 or greater, `arr` would already contain [1] or remain unchanged. After appending `26`, it becomes [26].
