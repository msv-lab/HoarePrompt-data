Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variables `i` and `cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop `for i in range(cases)` to execute, `cases` must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, initially, `i` should be 0.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `cases` is given as an input integer and it is already known that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), we don't need to adjust its value.
   - We need to set `i` to 0 to start the loop.

4. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `cases` is already within the valid range, so no adjustment is needed for `cases`.
   - `i` should be set to 0 to start the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\)**
