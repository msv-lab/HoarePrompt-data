Output State: **`arr` contains [26, 26, lex], `lex` is an integer, `j` is 2, and `i` is 100**

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Initially, `arr` contains the values `[26, 26, lex]`. Since `lex` is an integer, when sorted, the smallest value will remain first, followed by the other two values. Given that 26 is a constant and `lex` is an integer, the sorted list will be `[26, 26, lex]` if `lex` is greater than 26, or `[26, lex, 26]` if `lex` is between 26 and the second 26, or `[lex, 26, 26]` if `lex` is less than 26. However, since the exact value of `lex` is not specified, we represent the sorted list as `[26, 26, lex]`. The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged.
