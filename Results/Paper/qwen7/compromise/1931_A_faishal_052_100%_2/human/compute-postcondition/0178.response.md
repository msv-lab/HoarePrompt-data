Output State: **`temp` is 'abcdefe', `i` is 4, `j` is 5**

Explanation: The code `temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)` concatenates a character to the string `temp`. Here, `info[i][j]` is assumed to be a list or array where `info[4][5]` returns a value. Since no specific value for `info[4][5]` is given, we assume it returns a value that when added to `96` gives the ASCII value of 'e'. Therefore, `chr(96 + 1)` (assuming `info[4][5]` is 1) results in the character 'e', which is then concatenated to `temp`, changing it from 'abcdef' to 'abcdefe'. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
