Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is a non-negative integer, if `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains the elements 1 and 26, if `lex` is between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the elements 26, if `lex` is 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. Depending on the value of `lex`, the initial content of `arr` changes accordingly. If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` initially contains 1 and now also contains 26, making it `[1, 26]`. If `lex` is between 27 and 52 (exclusive), `arr` initially contains 26 and now also contains 26, making it `[26]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` remains unchanged and only contains 26.
