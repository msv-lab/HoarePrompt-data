Output State: **`temp` is 'a', `i` is 5, `j` is 1, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 3**

Explanation: The code updates `temp` by concatenating it with the character represented by `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`. Given the initial state where `temp` is an empty string (`''`), `i` is 4, and `j` is 0, the first character added to `temp` is `chr(info[4][0] + 96)`. Assuming `info` is properly defined and `info[4][0]` is 1 (since `a` is the first letter and its ASCII value offset by 96 gives 1), `temp` becomes `'a'`. After this operation, `i` is incremented to 5, and `j` is set to 1. The condition for `cases` remains unchanged.
