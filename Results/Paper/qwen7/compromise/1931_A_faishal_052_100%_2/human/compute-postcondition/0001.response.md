Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 78; `info` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `info`. This does not affect the values of `cases` or `n` for each test case. Therefore, the conditions for `cases` and `n` remain unchanged.
