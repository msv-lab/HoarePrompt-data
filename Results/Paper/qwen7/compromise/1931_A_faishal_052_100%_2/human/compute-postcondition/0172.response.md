Output State: **`temp` is '', `i` is 4, `cases` must be 5**

Explanation: The code `temp = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `temp`. This overwrites the previous value of `temp`, which was the original value of `temp` plus the sum of characters corresponding to `info[i][j]` shifted by 96. The values of `i` and `cases` remain unchanged.
