Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: According to the given state before the loop starts, `j` is currently set to 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `for j in range(2)` will iterate over the values generated by `range(2)`, which are `0` and `1`.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `j` must take on each value in the range `0` and `1`. Since `j` is already set to `2`, it does not satisfy the loop condition. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `j` takes on the values `0` and `1` during the iterations of the loop.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`arr`, `lex`, `i`, and `cases`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to ensure the loop can execute properly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` must take on the values 0 and 1**
