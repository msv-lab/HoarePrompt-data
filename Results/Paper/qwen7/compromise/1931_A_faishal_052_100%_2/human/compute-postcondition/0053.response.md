Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range of 2. Given that the loop runs twice (as per the provided states), it implies that the loop condition `for j in range(2):` will run its full cycle, meaning `j` will take both 0 and 1 as its values during these iterations.

After the loop completes all its iterations, the final state will be:
- `i` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `cases` remains an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\).
- `arr` will contain either one of the following based on the conditions met during the loop:
  - If `lex` was less than 28 for all iterations, `arr` will be `[1, 1]`.
  - If `lex` was between 28 and 52 for all iterations, `arr` will be `[26, 1]`.
  - If `lex` was between 52 and 78 for all iterations, `arr` will be `[26, 26]`.
- `lex` will be reduced by either 1 or 26 for each iteration, so after two iterations, `lex` will be reduced by 2 or 52, respectively, depending on the conditions met.
- `j` will be 1 after the last iteration of the loop.

Thus, the final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:
- `i` is 0.
- `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\).
- `arr` is either `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[26, 26]`.
- `lex` is reduced by either 2 or 52.
- `j` is 1.
