Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `lex`. The values of `i` and `cases` remain unchanged, and `arr` stays as an empty list.
