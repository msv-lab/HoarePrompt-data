Output State: **`i` is 1, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is reduced by either 2 or 52, `j` is 1, `info` now contains the list `arr`**

Explanation: The code `arr = []` initializes `arr` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `cases`, `lex`, `j`, or `info`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
