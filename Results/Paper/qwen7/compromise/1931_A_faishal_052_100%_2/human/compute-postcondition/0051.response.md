Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is either [1, 1, 1], [1, 26, 1], [26, 1], [1, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26], `lex` is reduced by 1 or 26, `j` is 0.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` remains 0, `cases` stays within the range of 1 to 100, and `arr` takes one of the specified forms depending on the value of `lex`. Specifically, `lex` is reduced by either 1 or 26, and `j` remains 0.
