Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will range from 0 to `cases-1`, meaning it will take on every integer value within that range exactly once. `cases` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\). The variable `arr` will contain a list of integers where each list represents the processed values of `lex` for a particular test case, with `lex` being reduced by either 2, 26, or 52 based on the conditions specified in the loop. Each `arr` list will be sorted. The variable `lex` will hold the final value after processing for each test case, which is appended to `arr`. The `info` list will contain all the `arr` lists generated for each test case, sorted as per the loop's operation.

In summary, `info` will be a list of lists, where each inner list represents the processed values of `lex` for a specific test case, sorted according to the operations performed in the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cases):
    temp = ''
    for j in range(3):
        temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
    print(temp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `temp` is the original value of `temp` plus the sum of characters corresponding to `info[i][j]` shifted by 96 for all `j` from 0 to 2*5-1 (since the loop runs 5 times), `j` is 5.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `temp` is 'abcdefe', `i` is 7, `j` is 5.

Explanation: The loop runs for 3 iterations as specified by the range(3). After each iteration, `temp` is updated by appending a character based on the value of `info[i][j] + 96`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 4 throughout the loop, but `j` starts from 0 and reaches 5 after 3 iterations. Since the loop condition is met exactly 3 times, `temp` will end up as 'abcdefe' after all iterations. The variable `i` increments by 3 (since it was initially 4 and no increment is shown in the loop body) to become 7.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `temp` is 'aamo', `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 3.

After analyzing the given loop and its initial and intermediate states, we can see that the loop runs exactly 3 times based on the provided information. The variable `i` increments to 5 after the first iteration and remains there for subsequent iterations since it is not modified within the loop. The variable `j` starts from 0 and increments with each iteration until it reaches 3. The variable `temp` concatenates characters derived from `info[i][j] + 96`, which results in the string 'aamo' after 3 iterations. Since the loop runs exactly 3 times as specified by the `cases` variable, there are no further iterations to consider. Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is `temp` being 'aamo', `i` remaining 4, `j` at 3, and `cases` still needing to be greater than or equal to 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
