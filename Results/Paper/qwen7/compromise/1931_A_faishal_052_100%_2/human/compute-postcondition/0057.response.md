The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i < cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `cases`.

Since `i` is currently 0, it is less than any positive value of `cases`. Therefore, the loop can execute again as long as `cases` remains within its defined range.

Given this, the only adjustment needed is to increment `i` by 1, making it 1. The value of `cases` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 1, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is either `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[26, 26]` sorted, `lex` is reduced by either 2 or 52, `j` is 1, `info` now contains the list `arr`**
