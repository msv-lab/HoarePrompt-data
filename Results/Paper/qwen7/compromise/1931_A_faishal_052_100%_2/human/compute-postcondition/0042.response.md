Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is either [1, 1, 1] or [1, 26, 1] or [26, 1], `lex` is equal to `lex` - 1, `j` is 0**.

This means that the value of `lex` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables (`i`, `cases`, `arr`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
