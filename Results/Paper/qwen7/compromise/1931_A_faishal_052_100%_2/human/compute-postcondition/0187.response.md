Output State: **`temp` is 'aam', `i` is 5, `j` is 2, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` by concatenating it with the character obtained from `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`. Given the initial state, `info[i][j]` would be `i[j]` which is `2`, and `chr(2 + 96)` is `'a'`. So, `temp` changes from `'a'` to `'am'`, and then to `'am'` plus another `'m'`, resulting in `'aam'`. The values of `i`, `j`, and the condition on `cases` remain unchanged.
