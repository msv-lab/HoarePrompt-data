Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is [1], `lex` is an input integer, and the current value of `lex` is less than 28, `j` is 0**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
