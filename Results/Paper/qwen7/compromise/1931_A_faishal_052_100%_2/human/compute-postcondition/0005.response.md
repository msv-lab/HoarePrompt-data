Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and the range function. The variable `j` is the iterator of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 0 because `range(2)` generates values from 0 to 1 (inclusive).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than 2. Since `j` starts at 0, it will execute for the first iteration (when `j` is 0) and then again for the second iteration (when `j` is 1).

4. **Adjust the states of the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head that needs adjustment is `j`, which should be set to 0 initially. No other variables or lists need to be adjusted since they are not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should be 0 (which it already is).
- Since no other objects in the loop head need adjustment, we don't need to change the states of `i`, `cases`, `arr`, or `lex`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer, `j` is 0**
