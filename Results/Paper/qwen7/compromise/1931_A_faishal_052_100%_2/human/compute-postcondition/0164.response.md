Output State: **`temp` is the original value of `temp` plus the character corresponding to `info[i][j]` shifted by 96.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `temp` by appending to it the character that corresponds to the value of `info[i][j] + 96`. Since `info[i][j]` is an index into the alphabet (assuming `chr` is converting an integer to its corresponding lowercase letter), adding 96 shifts the character to the correct position in the alphabet. However, without knowing the exact values of `info[i][j]` and the initial value of `temp`, we can only express the updated value of `temp` in this general form.
