You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will range from 0 to `cases-1`, meaning it will take on every integer value within that range exactly once. `cases` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\). The variable `arr` will contain a list of integers where each list represents the processed values of `lex` for a particular test case, with `lex` being reduced by either 2, 26, or 52 based on the conditions specified in the loop. Each `arr` list will be sorted. The variable `lex` will hold the final value after processing for each test case, which is appended to `arr`. The `info` list will contain all the `arr` lists generated for each test case, sorted as per the loop's operation.
    #
    #In summary, `info` will be a list of lists, where each inner list represents the processed values of `lex` for a specific test case, sorted according to the operations performed in the loop.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: Output State: `temp` is 'aamo', `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `cases` is 3.
    #
    #Explanation: After analyzing the loop and the given states, we can conclude that the loop runs exactly 3 times. The variable `i` remains at 4 because it is not incremented within the loop body. The variable `j` reaches 3 after 3 iterations. The variable `temp` concatenates characters derived from `info[i][j] + 96`, resulting in the string 'aamo'. Since the loop runs exactly 3 times, `cases` must be 3, and there are no further iterations to consider. Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is `temp` being 'aamo', `i` remaining 4, `j` at 3, and `cases` being 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each containing an integer `lex` ranging from 28 to 78. For each test case, it processes `lex` by subtracting 2, 26, or 52 based on certain conditions, sorts the resulting values, and appends the final value of `lex` to the list. It then constructs a string from the first three elements of each processed list and prints these strings. The function does not return any value but prints the constructed strings for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for determining the characters in the word is flawed. Let's consider the test case `n = 24`:

- According to the problem, the word "aav" should be the lexicographically smallest word that encodes to 24.
- However, the program attempts to break down the integer into parts that do not necessarily correspond to valid characters in the alphabet.

For instance, when `lex = 24`, the program tries to fit the values into the ranges defined by the conditions, which do not correctly map to the characters 'a', 'a', and 'v'. The program sorts the resulting array and converts the smallest values to characters, which may not produce the correct lexicographically smallest word.

To illustrate, let's walk through the logic for `n = 24`:
- The program checks if `lex < 28`, which fails.
- It then checks if `lex < 52`, which also fails.
- Finally, it sets `arr.append(lex)` and sorts the array, resulting in `[24]`.
- Converting `[24]` to characters gives `'x'`, which is clearly incorrect.

A correct approach would involve directly calculating the characters based on the sum, ensuring that each character is within the valid range of 1 to 26. The provided solution does not achieve this, leading to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
