Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. It separates the password into digits and letters while maintaining their order.
3. The logic checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter, which is handled by the `last_digit_index` variable.
4. It then checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function.
5. If any of these conditions fail, the function returns 'NO'.
6. If all conditions pass, the function returns 'YES'.

Given the provided code and the logic described, the program appears to correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
