Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. The function `func_1` correctly separates the digits and letters from the password.
3. The function checks if the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.
4. The logic in the function ensures that:
   - There are no digits after a letter.
   - All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
5. The function returns 'YES' if both conditions are met, and 'NO' otherwise.
6. The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem description and the requirements.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states.

Correctness: **True**
