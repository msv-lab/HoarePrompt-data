Output State: **`end` is increased by 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 3`, `a[r - 1]` is equal to `a[r - 2]**.

Explanation: The code `end += 1` increases the value of `end` by 1. Since `end` was initially increased by 1, it is now increased by 2. The values of `n`, `a`, `l`, and the condition `a[r - 1] == a[r - 2]` remain unchanged.
