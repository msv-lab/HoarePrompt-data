Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 2, `r` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `a[1]` must be equal to `a[2]`, `st` is 1, `end` is 0**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was initially 1, after executing this line, `l` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
