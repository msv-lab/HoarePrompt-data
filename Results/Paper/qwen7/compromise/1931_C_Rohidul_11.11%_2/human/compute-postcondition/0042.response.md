Output State: **`end` is increased by 6, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is equal to `r - 3`, where `r` is the last index of the list `a` after the first iteration, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`end`, `a`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
