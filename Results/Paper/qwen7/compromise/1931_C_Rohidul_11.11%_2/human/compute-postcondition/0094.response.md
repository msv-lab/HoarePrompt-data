Output State: **`l` is increased by 3, `r` must be greater than `l + 2`, `st` is 2**.

Explanation: The variable `st` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (since it was not given). Given the initial state, `l` is increased by 3 and `r` must be greater than `l + 2`. After executing `st += 1`, `st` becomes 2. The other conditions remain unchanged.
