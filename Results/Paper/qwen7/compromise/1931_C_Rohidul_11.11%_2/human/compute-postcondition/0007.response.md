Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 1, `r` must be greater than 0, `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `st` is 1, `end` is 0**

The code `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Initially, `st` is 0, so after executing this line, `st` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
