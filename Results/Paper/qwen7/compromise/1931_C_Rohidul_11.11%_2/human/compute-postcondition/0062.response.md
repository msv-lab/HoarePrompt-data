Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `r - 1` or a value greater than 0 but still less than or equal to `n - 3`, `a[r] == a[r - 1]` is true, `end` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `end` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
