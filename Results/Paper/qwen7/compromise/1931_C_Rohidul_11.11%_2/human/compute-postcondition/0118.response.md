Postcondition: **`l` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `end` equals `end + 3`, and `ans` is equal to `r - l` if either `st` is not equal to 0, or `end` is not equal to 0, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`.**
