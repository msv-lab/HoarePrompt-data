Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `st` and `end` to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
