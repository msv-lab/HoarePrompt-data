Output State: **`st` is equal to `st + 2`, `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` must be greater than `l`, and `a[l]` must be equal to `a[l + 1]`**.

Explanation: The initial state had `st` equal to `st + 1`, and the code `st += 1` increments `st` by 1 again, making `st` equal to `st + 2`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
