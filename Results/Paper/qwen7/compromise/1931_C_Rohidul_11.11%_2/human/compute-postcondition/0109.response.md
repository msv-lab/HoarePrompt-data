Output State: **`l` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `r` is `r - 1`, `a[r]` is equal to `a[r - 1]`, `st` is equal to the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `end` is increased by 3 and now equals `end + 3`, `ans` is `r - l - 1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `ans` as `r - l - 1`. Since `r` is `r - 1` and `l` is the total number of consecutive identical elements in the list from index 0 to `r-4`, `ans` is simply the difference between `r - 1` and `l`, minus 1. The values of `st`, `a[r]`, and `end` remain unchanged, and the first element of the list `a` is still equal to the last element of the list `a`.
