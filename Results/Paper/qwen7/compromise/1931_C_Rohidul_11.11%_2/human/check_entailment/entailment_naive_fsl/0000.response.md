Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in the program does not account for the optimal way to perform the operations to minimize the cost. Specifically, the program only checks for consecutive equal elements at the start and end of the array and does not consider other possible segmentations that could result in a lower cost.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program would incorrectly output `4` because it only considers the segments `[1, 1]` and `[5, 5]`, but the optimal solution would be to change all elements to `2` or `4`, resulting in a cost of `3`.

Another example is:
```
5
1 2 2 2 1
```
The program would incorrectly output `3` because it only considers the segment `[1, 1]` and `[5, 5]`, but the optimal solution would be to change all elements to `2`, resulting in a cost of `2`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
