Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation where the cost is the length of the subarray selected.

2. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code iterates over multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost to make all elements equal.
   - The logic in the code seems to focus on finding the longest segment of consecutive identical elements at the beginning and the end of the array.
   - The variable `l` is used to track the start of the segment of consecutive identical elements from the beginning, and `r` is used to track the end of the segment of consecutive identical elements from the end.
   - The variables `st` and `end` are used to count the number of consecutive identical elements at the start and end, respectively.

3. **Issues in the Code**:
   - The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for the optimal way to make all elements equal.
   - The logic for setting `ans` does not consider the actual cost of operations and the optimal strategy to minimize the cost.
   - The code does not handle cases where the array already has all elements equal or where the optimal operation involves changing a segment in the middle of the array.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, one should identify the minimum cost operation that would make all elements equal. This involves finding the minimum cost to change segments of the array to match the mode (most frequent element) of the array.
   - The optimal solution would involve identifying the mode of the array and calculating the cost of changing all other elements to this mode.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
