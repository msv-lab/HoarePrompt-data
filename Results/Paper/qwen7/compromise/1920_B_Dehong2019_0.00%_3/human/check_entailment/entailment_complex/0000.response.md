Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.
3. It sorts the array `a` in descending order.
4. It calculates `ans1` as the sum of the array `a` initially.
5. It then iteratively reduces `ans1` by twice the value of the smallest elements up to `x` times, simulating Bob's action of flipping the smallest elements.
6. It also calculates `ans2` by considering the scenario where Alice removes the smallest `k` elements first and then Bob flips the smallest remaining elements up to `x` times.
7. Finally, it prints the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the function appears to be correctly implementing the described game rules and calculating the optimal sum for each test case. The function handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
