Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`**.

Given the initial state where `i` is 0 and `x` must be greater than 0, the code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` updates `ans1` by subtracting twice the value of `a[i]` from `ans1`. Since `i` is 0, `a[0]` is used in the calculation. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
