Output State: **`i` is equal to the value of `x`; `ans1` is decreased by the sum of each element in list `a` multiplied by 2 for every iteration up to `x`; `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2 = ans1` simply assigns the current value of `ans1` to `ans2`. This does not change the values of `i` or `ans1`. Therefore, `i` remains equal to the value of `x`, `ans1` is decreased by the sum of each element in list `a` multiplied by 2 for every iteration up to `x`, and `ans2` is now equal to the current value of `ans1`.
