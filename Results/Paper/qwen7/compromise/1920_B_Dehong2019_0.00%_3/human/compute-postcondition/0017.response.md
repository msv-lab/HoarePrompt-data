Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * sum(a[:x])` and then increased by `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain in their initial states, and the value of `i + x` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its current value. Since `i` is 2, `i + x` becomes `2 + x`. Therefore, `ans1` is updated to its previous value minus `2 * a[2 + x]`. The value of `ans2` remains unchanged and is still equal to `ans1`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a`) remain in their initial states, and the condition `i + x < n` is still valid.
