Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < x`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is `k + 1`
   - `x` is less than or equal to `k`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `ans1` is the new value of `ans1 - a[i] * 2`
   - `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1 + 1 = i + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than `x`. Therefore, `x` must remain the same (less than or equal to `k`).

5. **Update the States**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `x` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` becomes `i + 2`.
   - `ans1` and `ans` are not directly affected by the loop condition but may change inside the loop body. However, since we are focusing on the loop head, these states are not adjusted here.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is `k + 1`, `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `i + 2`, `ans1` is the new value of `ans1 - a[i] * 2`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**
