Postcondition: `i` is either 2 or remains 1, `ans1` is decreased by `2 * sum(a[:x])` and then increased by `a[0]`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain in their initial states, and the value of `i + x` is less than `n` if `i` becomes 2, otherwise `i + x` is not less than `n`.
