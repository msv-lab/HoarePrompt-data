Output State: **`t` is `k + 1`, `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is 2, `ans1` is the original sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` which is now equal to `ans1`, and `i + x` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans1` by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its current value. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans1` is adjusted accordingly, while `ans`, `t`, `x`, `i`, and the condition involving `i + x` and `n` stay the same.
