Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is reduced to an input integer, and the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` are yet to be determined
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `ans1` will be the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `k-1`, adjusted according to the conditions inside the loop, `ans2` will be equal to the final value of `ans1`, `ans` will hold the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, and all other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a`) will remain in their initial states.

In more detail, `ans1` will accumulate the sum of elements in `a` from index 0 to `k-1`, but it will be adjusted each iteration based on the condition `if i + x < n`. If this condition is true, `ans1` will also subtract `2 * a[i + x]`. The value of `ans` will always be the maximum between the current values of `ans1` and `ans2`, with `ans2` being updated to the final value of `ans1` after the loop completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is equal to `x + 3`, `ans1` is increased by `a[i]` if `i + x < n`, otherwise `ans1` remains unchanged, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (up to `k` times), the variable `i` will be set to `x + 3`. The value of `ans1` will have been updated based on the additions and subtractions performed within the loop, but only if the index `i + x` is still within the bounds of the list `a`. If `i + x` is not within the bounds, `ans1` will not be decreased. Finally, `ans` will hold the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is `k + 1`, `x` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is `k`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` after all iterations of the loop, and `ans1` is the final sum calculated after iterating through the entire list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k` because the loop runs from `0` to `k-1`. The variable `ans` will hold the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, where `ans1` is updated in each iteration by adding `a[i]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` if `i + x < n`. The variable `ans2` remains unchanged throughout the loop and is initially set to the same value as `ans1` before the loop starts. Therefore, `ans` will contain the highest value of `ans1` (or `ans2`) after all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
