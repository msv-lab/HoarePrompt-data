Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < x`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - The value of `ans1` is not directly affected by the loop itself but by the loop body. However, since no other information about `ans1` is given, we assume it remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2`**
