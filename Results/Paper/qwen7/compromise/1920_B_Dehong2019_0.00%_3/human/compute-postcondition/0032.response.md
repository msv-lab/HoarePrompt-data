Output State: **`ans1` is `ans1` plus `a[i]`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans1, ans2)` does not change the values of `ans1`, `ans`, `i`, or `ans2`. It simply assigns the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` to `ans`. The value of `i` is also not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with the additional clarification that `ans` is now the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
