Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially equal to the value of `x`.
   - `ans1` is decreased by the sum of each element in list `a` multiplied by 2 for every iteration up to `x`.
   - `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < k`. This means `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `x`, and the loop runs from `0` to `k-1`, `x` must be less than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute fully.
   - The loop body modifies `ans1`, but since we are only concerned with the initial state, we don't need to adjust `ans1` or `ans2` directly. However, we should ensure that the loop can run as intended.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `k`. Specifically, `x` must be less than or equal to `k` for the loop to execute properly.

**Final State**:
State: **`x` must be less than or equal to `k`, `i` is equal to `x`**
