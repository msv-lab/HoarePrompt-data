Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is the same as before, and `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[1] * 2 + a[2] * 2`.**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `i` is 2, `x` is the same as before, and `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[1] * 2`. The code snippet `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` updates `ans1` by subtracting `a[i] * 2` from its current value. Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`, and thus `ans1` is further decreased by `a[2] * 2`. Therefore, `ans1` is decreased by `a[0] * 2 + a[1] * 2 + a[2] * 2`.
