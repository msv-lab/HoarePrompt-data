Output State: **`good_subarrays` is `good_subarrays` + 1, `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` and `b` are lists of integers, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in list `b`, and `window_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of elements in the current window of size `m` in list `a`.**

The code `good_subarrays += 1` increments the value of `good_subarrays` by 1. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
