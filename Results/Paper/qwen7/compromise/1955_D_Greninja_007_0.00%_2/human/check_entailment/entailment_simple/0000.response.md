Reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes variables and reads input as specified.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` of length `m` that meet the criteria.
3. The logic within the function is sound:
   - It uses sliding window technique to maintain a counter of the current window of length `m` in array `a`.
   - It calculates the number of matching elements between the current window and array `b` using the minimum frequencies of common elements.
   - It updates the counts as the window slides through the array `a`.
   - It correctly handles the addition and removal of elements from the window frequency counter.
   - The final check ensures that any remaining good subarrays at the end of the loop are counted.
4. The program structure and logic align with the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem description and provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
