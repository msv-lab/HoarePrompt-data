Reasoning:

1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which processes the input arrays `a` and `b` along with the integers `k`, `n`, and `m`.
2. It initializes the counters for the frequency of elements in `b` (`b_freq`) and the sliding window of size `m` from `a` (`window_freq`).
3. It calculates the initial number of matching elements between the window and `b` using the `matches` variable.
4. It iterates through the array `a` using a sliding window approach, updating the `matches` count as the window slides.
5. The logic inside the loop correctly adjusts the `matches` count by removing the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the new element that is sliding into the window.
6. The final check ensures that if the last window also meets the condition, it is counted.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the correct logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
