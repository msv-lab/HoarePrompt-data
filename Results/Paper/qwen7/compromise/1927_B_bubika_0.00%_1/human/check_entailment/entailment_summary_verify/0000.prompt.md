You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

Example

Input

    5
    
    11
    
    0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4
    
    10
    
    0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
    
    1
    
    0
    
    8
    
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    
    8
    
    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Output

    abracadabra
    codeforces
    a
    aaaaaaaa
    dijkstra

- Program:
def func():
    a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    b = [0] * 26
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        r = ''
        for i in s:
            x = b.index(i)
            r += a[x]
            b[x] += 1
        print(r)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers `s`. It then constructs a string `r` by mapping each integer in `s` to a corresponding character in the alphabet `a` (where `a` is a list of lowercase English letters), repeating each character according to its frequency in `s`. The function updates a count list `b` to keep track of the total occurrences of each character index across all test cases. After processing all test cases, the function prints the constructed string `r` for each test case. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate a string based on the given trace. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  0 1 1 2 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  A string like `aaabb` where the trace `[0, 1, 1, 2, 2]` is generated correctly.

- Actual Output:
  The program generates a string using the indices directly from the trace, but it does not ensure that the counts match the required pattern. For example, it might generate a string like `abcde` instead of `aaabb`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the counts of each character match the trace. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        r = ['a'] * n
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(s[i]):
                r[i] = a[s[i]]
            r[i] = a[s[i]]
        print(''.join(r))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the counts of each character match the trace, generating a valid string for each test case.
