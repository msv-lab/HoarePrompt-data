Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `r` is the sum of the elements in list `a` at the indices specified by the elements in list `s`, `b` will contain the count of how many times each character (represented by its index) appeared in the list `s`, `t` is 2, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `s`. The values of `n`, `r`, `b`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
