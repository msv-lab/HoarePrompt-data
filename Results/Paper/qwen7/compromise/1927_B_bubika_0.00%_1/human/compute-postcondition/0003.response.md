Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 â‰¤ a_i < n, `b` is a list of 26 zeros**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still 1, `a` remains a list of `n` non-negative integers where each element is less than `n`, and `b` remains a list of 26 zeros.
