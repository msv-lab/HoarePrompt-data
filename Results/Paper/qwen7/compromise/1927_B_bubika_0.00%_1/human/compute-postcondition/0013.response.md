Output State: **`r` is increased by `a[x]`, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in the list `s`, `x` is the index of the new `i` in the list `b`, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is assigned the index of `i` in the list `b`, `r` is updated by adding `a[x]` to its current value, `b[x]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value of `b[x]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
