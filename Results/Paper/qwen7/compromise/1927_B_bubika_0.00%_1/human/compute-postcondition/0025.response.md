Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `r` is an empty string, `b` is the count of how many times each character (represented by its index) appeared in the list `s`, `t` is 2, `s` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is assigned the index of `i` in the list `b`**.

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` assigns the index of `i` in the list `b` to the variable `x`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The list `b` represents the count of how many times each character (by its index) appeared in the list `s`.
