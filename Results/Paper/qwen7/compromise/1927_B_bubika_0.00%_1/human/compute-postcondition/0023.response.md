Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `r` is an empty string, `b` is the count of how many times each character (represented by its index) appeared in the list `s`, `t` is 2, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The line `r = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `r`. All other variables (`n`, `b`, `t`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
