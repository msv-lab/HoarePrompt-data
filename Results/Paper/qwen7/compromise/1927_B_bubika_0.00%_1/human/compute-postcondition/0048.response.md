Output State: **`i` is the element that was previously at the index returned by `b.index(i)` in list `b`; `s` is the list `s` without the first element.**

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` finds the index of `i` in the list `b` and assigns it to `x`. The initial state mentions that `i` is the next element in the list `s` and `s` is the list `s` without its first element. After executing the code, `i` becomes the element that was found at the index `x` in the list `b`, while `s` remains unchanged as the list without its first element.
