### Reasoning

The original assessment is incorrect because it fails to recognize that `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the issues and provide a detailed analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It returns 'Yes' if the array is sorted.
   - It returns 'No' if there is at least one pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element.
   - However, this function does not account for the possibility of sorting the array by splitting and swapping parts. For example, the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` is not sorted, but it can be sorted by splitting it into `[4, 5, 1, 4]` and `[1, 1]` and then swapping them to get `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`), the size of each array (`n`), and the elements of each array.
   - It then calls `func_1` with each array and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results.
   - Since `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem, `func_2` will also not work as intended. Specifically, `func_2` will incorrectly identify arrays that can be sorted by splitting and swapping as unsorted.

### Detailed Analysis

Let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. **Input**:
   ```
   3
   6
   1 1 4 5 1 4
   5
   7 9 2 2 3
   3
   1 2 3
   ```

2. **Expected Output**:
   ```
   No
   Yes
   Yes
   ```

3. **Actual Output**:
   - For the first test case `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, `func_1` would return 'No' because the array is not sorted.
   - For the second test case `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, `func_1` would return 'No' because the array is not sorted.
   - For the third test case `[1, 2, 3]`, `func_1` would return 'Yes' because the array is already sorted.

However, the expected output shows that the second and third test cases should return 'Yes' because they can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts.

### Conclusion

Since `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem, the entire program is incorrect. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
