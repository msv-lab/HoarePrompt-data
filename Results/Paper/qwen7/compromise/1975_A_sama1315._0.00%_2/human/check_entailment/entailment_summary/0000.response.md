Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
- The provided solution uses `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted or if there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements where the first element is greater than the second. If such a pair exists, it means the array is not sorted and cannot be made sorted by the given operation.
- `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
- The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies if the array can be sorted by checking for any out-of-order pairs, which aligns with the problem statement.
- The implementation in `func_2` correctly processes each test case and outputs the results in the required format.

Given this analysis, the functions together correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
