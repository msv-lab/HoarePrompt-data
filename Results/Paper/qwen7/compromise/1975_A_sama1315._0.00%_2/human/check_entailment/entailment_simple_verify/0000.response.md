### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the correctness of the assessment.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted (`all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`) and returns `'Yes'` if it is.
- If the array is not sorted, it checks if there is exactly one pair of consecutive elements where the first element is greater than the second (`any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`). If there is, it returns `'No'`, otherwise it returns `'Yes'`.

This approach is flawed because:
1. It only checks for one out-of-order pair, which is insufficient to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.
2. There are cases where the array can be made non-decreasing even if there are multiple out-of-order pairs, as long as they can be rearranged properly.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- The input handling and processing logic seems correct for reading the number of test cases, the size of each array, and the array elements.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code provides detailed states at key points, which help in understanding the flow of the program.
- The state transitions are consistent with the logic described in the functions.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
- Consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`:
  - The array is not sorted, and there are multiple out-of-order pairs (e.g., `[1, 4]`, `[4, 1]`, etc.).
  - `func_1` would return `'No'` because it finds more than one out-of-order pair.
  - However, according to the problem statement, this array cannot be made non-decreasing by any number of splits and swaps, which means the function should return `'No'`.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. It only checks for one out-of-order pair, which is insufficient.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.
