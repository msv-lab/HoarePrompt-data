### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries step-by-step to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted (`all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`) or if there is exactly one pair of elements that are out of order (`any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`).
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `'Yes'`.
   - If there is exactly one pair of elements that are out of order, it returns `'No'`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `'Yes'`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the array and storing the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of `func_1`:

The function `func_1` has a flaw in its logic. It only checks if the array is already sorted or if there is exactly one pair of elements that are out of order. This is insufficient to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.

Consider the example array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`:
- The array is not sorted.
- There is more than one pair of elements that are out of order.
- However, the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4] -> [4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1]`.

The function `func_1` would incorrectly return `'No'` for this array because it only checks for one out-of-order pair.

### Analysis of `func_2`:

The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1`. However, since `func_1` has the flaw mentioned above, the overall solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. The function `func_1` fails to handle cases where the array can be rearranged by splitting and swapping, even though it is not initially sorted or has more than one out-of-order pair.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
