### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted and does not account for the possibility of sorting the array by splitting and swapping parts. Therefore, `func_1` is insufficient for solving the problem. The original assessment also correctly points out that `func_2` relies on `func_1`, making `func_2` incorrect as well.

However, the original assessment concludes that the program is incorrect without providing a detailed explanation of why `func_1` fails to solve the problem. Let's elaborate on why `func_1` is incorrect and how the problem can be solved correctly.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This check is necessary but not sufficient for determining if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts.
   - For example, the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` is not sorted, but it can be sorted by splitting it into `[1, 1, 4, 5]` and `[1, 4]` and then swapping them to get `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to implement a function that checks if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to find the longest non-decreasing subarray and then check if the remaining part can be sorted independently.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_sort_by_splitting(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 1:
        return True
    
    # Find the longest non-decreasing subarray starting from the beginning
    start = 0
    while start < n - 1 and arr[start] <= arr[start + 1]:
        start += 1
    
    # If the entire array is non-decreasing, return True
    if start == n - 1:
        return True
    
    # Check if the remaining part can be sorted independently
    end = n - 1
    while end > 0 and arr[end] >= arr[end - 1]:
        end -= 1
    
    # If the remaining part is non-increasing, return False
    if end == 0:
        return False
    
    # Check if the subarray between the two parts is non-decreasing
    mid = start + 1
    while mid < end and arr[mid] <= arr[mid - 1]:
        mid += 1
    
    # If the subarray between the two parts is non-decreasing, return True
    if mid == end:
        return True
    
    return False

# Function 2
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = can_sort_by_splitting(arr)
        results.append('Yes' if result else 'No')
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This corrected version of the program checks if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts, ensuring that the function `can_sort_by_splitting` handles the problem correctly.
