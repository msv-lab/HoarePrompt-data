### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The key insight is that if the array is already non-decreasing, or if there exists a single split point where the left part is non-decreasing and the right part is non-decreasing, then the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping those parts.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if the array is already non-decreasing (`all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`). If true, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not non-decreasing, it further checks if there exists a single split point where the left part and the right part are both non-decreasing. If such a split point exists, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input parsing and ensures that `func_1` is called with the appropriate arguments.
   - The results are collected and printed in the correct format.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by the specified operation.
   - The input handling and output formatting are correct.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handle the input/output as specified.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
