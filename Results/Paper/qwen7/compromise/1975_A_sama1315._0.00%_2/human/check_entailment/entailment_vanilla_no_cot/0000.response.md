Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in `func_1`. The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order but does not account for the possibility of sorting the array through the specified operation (splitting and swapping parts). 

To correctly solve this problem, you need to check if the array can be split into two parts such that the concatenated result is non-decreasing. Here's a revised approach:

1. **Identify the Split Point**: Find the point where the array can be split into two parts such that the concatenated result is non-decreasing.
2. **Check Non-Decreasing Order**: Ensure that the left part is non-decreasing and the right part is non-decreasing, and also ensure that the last element of the left part is less than or equal to the first element of the right part.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            left_part = arr[:i + 1]
            right_part = arr[i + 1:]
            # Check if the concatenated array is non-decreasing
            if all(left_part[j] <= left_part[j + 1] for j in range(len(left_part) - 1)) and \
               all(right_part[j] <= right_part[j + 1] for j in range(len(right_part) - 1)) and \
               (len(left_part) == 0 or left_part[-1] <= right_part[0]):
                return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This revised function `func_1` correctly identifies if the array can be split and reordered to be non-decreasing.
