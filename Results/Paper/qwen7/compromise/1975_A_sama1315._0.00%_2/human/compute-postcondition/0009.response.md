Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `index` is defined as `2 + 2 * t`, where `t` is 0.
     - Therefore, `index = 2 + 2 * 0 = 2`.
   - `t` is explicitly given as 0.
   - `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`.
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `1 ≤ arr_i ≤ 10^6`.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting an input string using spaces.
   - `results` is a list of length `t` (which is 0), where each element is the result of calling `func_1` on a list of `n` integers. Since `t` is 0, `results` is an empty list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

Given that `results` is an empty list, the `'\n'.join(results)` operation will join an empty list with newline characters, resulting in an empty string.

Therefore, the output will be an empty string.

Output: **""**
