Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer from the data list at position `index-1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ 10^6 for all i, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces.**

Explanation: The line `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` is 1, so after executing the line, `index` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `data` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given line of code.
