Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 3, `i` is 6 + N, `N` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0, `cnt[a[6]]` is N.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(N):
    if cnt[i] == 1:
        t += 1
    if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
        print(i)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is 4, `i` is 6 + N, `N` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0, and if `cnt[i]` equals 0 or `t` is greater than or equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is 5, `i` is 7 + N, `a` remains a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` remains a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`. If neither condition is met, the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 6, `i` is 8 + N, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if either `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0` holds true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
