Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 6, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with an integer default factory, meaning that every time a new key is accessed, its value is set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `N`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
