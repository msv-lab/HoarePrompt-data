Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 1
- `i` is 3
- `N` is greater than 0
- The condition `t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` is true (since `t` is 1, the condition simplifies to `1 >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0`, which further simplifies to `False or cnt[i] == 0`). Therefore, `cnt[i]` must be 0.

Given these conditions, the `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

Output: **3**
