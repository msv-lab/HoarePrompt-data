Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `N`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < N`.

3. **Analyze the Given Postcondition**: After the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `cnt[i]` remains either 0 or 1, and `t` is increased by 1, making it `t + 1`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `t` was increased by 1, the new value of `t` is `t + 1`.
   - The variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration of the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` must be increased by 1 from its previous value.
   - `N` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.
   - `cnt[i]` remains either 0 or 1, but since `i` changes, `cnt[i]` will refer to a different element in the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is increased by 1.
- `N` remains the same.
- `cnt[i]` remains either 0 or 1 (but now refers to the next index).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `N` is `N`, `cnt[i]` remains either 0 or 1**
