Output State: **`t` is 5, `i` is 7 + N, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The values of `i`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
