Postcondition: `t` is 5, `i` is 7 + N, `a` remains a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` remains a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0. If `cnt[i]` equals 0 or `t` is greater than or equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
