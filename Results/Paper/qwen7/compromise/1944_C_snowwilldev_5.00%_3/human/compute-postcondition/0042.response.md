Output State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 6, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and `N` remains an input integer as per the initial state, though its specific value is not provided.
