Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `tc`, which is initialized by calling `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `tc` is a positive integer and within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4).

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute, `tc` must be a positive integer within the specified range. Since `tc` is initialized by reading input from the user, the initial value of `t` must be read and assigned to `tc`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `tc` is the value of `t` after it has been read from the input.

**State:**
**`tc` is the value of `t` after it has been read from the input, and 1 ≤ tc ≤ 2⋅10^4**
