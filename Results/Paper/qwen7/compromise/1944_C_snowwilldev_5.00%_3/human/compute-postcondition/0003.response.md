Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value int.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with a default factory function `int`. This means that `cnt` can be accessed with any key, and if that key does not exist, it will be automatically initialized with the value `0`. The values of `N` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
