Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is the variable `tc` in the line `for tc in range(int(input())):`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `tc` is within the range defined by `int(input())`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `t` is \(N + 3\)
   - `i` is \(6 + N\)
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0
   - The loop breaks if `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`

4. **Determine the Next Iteration State**:
   - For the loop to continue, `tc` must be less than `int(input())`.
   - Since `tc` starts from 0 (as it is part of a range starting from 0), the next value of `tc` would be 1 if the loop is to execute one more time.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` remains \(N + 3\) because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` remains \(6 + N\) because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `a` remains the same list of integers because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `cnt` remains a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0 because it is not affected by the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is \(N + 3\), `i` is \(6 + N\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0, and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0**.
