Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. For each test case, it processes a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ a_i < n), and the sum of all integers across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. It then returns a result based on the processed integers.**

Note: The specific processing logic for the integers is not detailed here as per the instruction to only describe parameters and return values.
