Output State: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt[a[i]]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `cnt[a[i]] += 1` increments the count of `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, this means that `cnt[a[0]]` is incremented by 1. Since no specific value for `a[0]` is given, we only know that `cnt[a[0]]` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
