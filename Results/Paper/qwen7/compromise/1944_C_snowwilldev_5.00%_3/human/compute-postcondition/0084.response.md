Output State: **`t` is \(N + 3\), `i` is \(6 + N\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0, and the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0**.

Explanation: The line `cnt = defaultdict(int)` initializes a new `defaultdict` with the default factory set to `int`. This means that `cnt` is now a dictionary where each key is mapped to an integer value, and if a key is accessed that does not exist, it will default to 0. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and the condition for breaking the loop remain unchanged.
