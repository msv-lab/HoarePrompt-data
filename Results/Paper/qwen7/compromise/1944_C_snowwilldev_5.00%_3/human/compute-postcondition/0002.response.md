Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user (which is expected to be an integer `N`), splits the input into individual elements based on spaces, and then converts each element into an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `a`. The initial value of `N` remains unchanged, but now `a` holds the list of integers obtained from the input.
