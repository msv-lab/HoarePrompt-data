Output State: **`cnt[i]` is either 0 or still equal to 1, and `t` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, it breaks out of the loop or case it is inside. Since no variables are modified within the given code snippet, the values of `cnt[i]` remain unchanged (either 0 or still equal to 1) and `t` is increased by 1. All other variables from the initial state remain unaffected.
