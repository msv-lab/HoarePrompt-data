You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a list of integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the list and determines if there is an integer that appears exactly once. If such an integer is found, it prints the index of the first occurrence and breaks out of the loop. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice can pick any element from `a`, append it to her array `c`, and delete it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to find the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of `c` at the end of the game, where both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `a`.
   - It uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It iterates through the elements of `a` and increments a counter `t` whenever an element appears exactly once.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if an element does not appear in `a` anymore (`cnt[i] == 0`), it prints the current index `i`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in the program does not correctly simulate the game. Specifically:
     - Alice can pick any element from `a` and add it to `c`, but the program does not simulate Alice's optimal strategy.
     - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and remove it, but the program does not simulate Bob's optimal strategy.
     - The program does not construct the array `c` based on the optimal moves of both players.
     - The program incorrectly assumes that the MEX can be determined by simply counting the occurrences of each index and checking when `t` reaches 2 or when an index is missing from `a`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the game rules or simulate the optimal strategies for both players.
   - Therefore, the program will not produce the correct output for the given problem.
