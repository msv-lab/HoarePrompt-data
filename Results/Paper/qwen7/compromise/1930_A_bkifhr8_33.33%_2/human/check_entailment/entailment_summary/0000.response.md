Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and the list of \( 2n \) integers.
- The program attempts to calculate the maximum score by repeatedly selecting the minimum of the first two elements in the list and removing them until fewer than two elements remain.
- However, the implementation has a logical error. Specifically, the loop condition `for i in range(n * 2):` does not correctly handle the removal of elements from the list. The indices used in `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect because they always remove the same indices regardless of the length of the list.
- This leads to incorrect results because the indices being removed do not reflect the current state of the list after each removal.

Correctness: **False**
