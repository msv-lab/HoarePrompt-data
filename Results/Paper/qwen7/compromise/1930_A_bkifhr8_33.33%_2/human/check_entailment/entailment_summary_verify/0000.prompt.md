You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and \( 2n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} \). It then calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of consecutive integers from the list \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} \) until fewer than two integers remain. The results for each test case are stored in a list and printed out. After processing all test cases, the list containing the results is empty.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the list contains duplicate smallest elements correctly. Specifically, the program only removes two elements at a time and adds the minimum of those two to the score. This approach fails when there are multiple occurrences of the smallest element, as it may not always choose the optimal pair to maximize the score.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2
1 1 2 1
```

The correct output should be `2`, as we can pair `1` and `1` twice, achieving a score of `1 + 1 = 2`. However, the current implementation might not always achieve this, leading to a lower score. For instance, it might pair `1` and `2` first, resulting in a score of `1`, and then pair the remaining `1` and `1`, again adding `1`, for a total score of `2`. But in the optimal solution, we should pair `1` and `1` twice to get a score of `2`.

To fix this, the program should sort the list and then pair the smallest elements sequentially, ensuring that all occurrences of the smallest elements are paired optimally.
