Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in ans_f:`. The only variable mentioned here is `i`, which iterates over the elements of `ans_f`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as the length of `lst` is greater than or equal to 2. However, the loop itself does not directly depend on `lst`; instead, it iterates over `ans_f`, which is a result of processing `lst`.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: Since the loop iterates over `ans_f`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is related to `ans_f`. Specifically, we need to ensure that `ans_f` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider the initial state**: The initial state given is that `ans_f` contains the sum of the minimum values between pairs of elements from the list `lst` for each iteration of the loop, until the length of `lst` is less than 2.

5. **Formulate the adjusted state**: For the loop to execute, `ans_f` must contain at least one element. This means that the processing of `lst` must have resulted in at least one value being added to `ans_f`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `ans_f` contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans_f` must contain at least one element**
