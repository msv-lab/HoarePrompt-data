Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` by the value of that minimum, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the `ans` variable was being updated. The values of `n`, `i`, and `lst` remain unchanged, and the `ans` variable retains its value based on the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement, indicating the end of that particular block of code.
