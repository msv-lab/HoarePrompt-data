Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `n * 2`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially set to `n * 2 + 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n * 2`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will not execute if `i` is already `n * 2` or more, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n * 2` at the start of the loop. Given that `i` is initially `n * 2 + 1`, we need to adjust `i` to be `n * 2` or less.

5. **Consider the value of `n`**: We need to ensure that `n` is a non-negative integer because `range(n * 2)` requires `n * 2` to be a valid positive integer (or zero).

6. **Adjust the state of other variables**: The other variables (`ans`, `l`, and `lst`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `i` should be `n * 2` or less.
- `n` must be a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the final state is:

**`ans` is 0, `i` is `n * 2` or less, `n` must be a non-negative integer, `l` is the input string from the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces**.
