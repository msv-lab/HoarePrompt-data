Output State: **`ans` is either 0 plus twice the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is 2 or 0 plus the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` when `len(lst)` is not 2, `i` is 3 if `len(lst)` is not 2, and `i` is 2 if `len(lst)` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `ans`, `i`, `n`, or `lst`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.
