Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` by the amount of that minimum value, `lst` is modified to remove the element at index `0 * 2` and the element at index 2, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
