Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `ans` was being updated. The values of `i`, `n`, and `lst` remain unchanged, and the update to `ans` does not occur because the `break` statement interrupts the process before `ans` can be modified.
