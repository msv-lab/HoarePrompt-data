Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`**

Explanation: The code `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` updates the value of `ans` by adding the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. The conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The state of the list `lst` and the value of `ans` are updated according to the condition specified.
