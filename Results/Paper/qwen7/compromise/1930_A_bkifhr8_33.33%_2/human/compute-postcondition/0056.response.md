Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `lst` is modified by removing the element at index 0.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which simplifies to index `0`. This means the first element of the list `lst` is removed. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
