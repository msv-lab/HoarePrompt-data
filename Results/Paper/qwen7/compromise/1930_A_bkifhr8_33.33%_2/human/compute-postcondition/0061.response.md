Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. If the length of `lst` is not 2, then `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the length of `lst` is 2, `lst` is modified by removing the element at index 1, and `ans` is updated accordingly.
