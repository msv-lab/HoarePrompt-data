Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, `lst` is modified to remove the element at index `0 * 2`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
