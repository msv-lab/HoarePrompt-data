Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is the value of `min(int(lst[1]), int(lst[2]))` added to its previous value, `lst` is modified to remove the first element.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which is `0`, from the list `lst`. Since `lst` was not defined initially, we assume it contains at least three elements (based on the context of the problem). After removing the first element, the list indices shift, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum of the new first two elements of the list plus its previous value.
