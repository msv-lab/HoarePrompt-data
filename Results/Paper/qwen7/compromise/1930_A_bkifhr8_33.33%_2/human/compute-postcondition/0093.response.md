Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is increased by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `n`, `i`, and `ans`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. The initial conditions and the value of `ans` remain unchanged.
