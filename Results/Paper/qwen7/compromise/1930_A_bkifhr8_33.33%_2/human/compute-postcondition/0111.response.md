Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in ans_f`. The variables involved here are `i` and `ans_f`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `ans_f` contains at least one element.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first element of `ans_f`.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is set to the first element of `ans_f` at the start of each iteration, for the loop to continue, `ans_f` must still contain at least one element.
   - After the first element is used (which is `i`), the next element in `ans_f` will be used in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ans_f` must still contain at least one element for the loop to execute again.
   - `i` will be set to the next element in `ans_f` for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`ans_f` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `ans_f`**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`ans_f` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `ans_f`**.
