Output State: **`ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input string, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.**

Explanation: The code splits the input string `l` by spaces and assigns the resulting list to `lst`. The variables `ans` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
