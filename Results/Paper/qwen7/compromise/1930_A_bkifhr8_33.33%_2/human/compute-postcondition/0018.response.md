Postcondition: `ans` is 0 + the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is greater than 0. If `lst` does not have a length of 2, the second element of `lst` has been removed. If the length of `lst` is 2, either the second element is removed or the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
