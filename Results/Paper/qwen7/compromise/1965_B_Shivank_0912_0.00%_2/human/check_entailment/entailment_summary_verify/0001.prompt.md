You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
cases = []
index = 1
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    k = int(data[index + 1])
    cases.append((n, k))
    index += 2
results = func_1(t, cases)
for result in results:
    print(result[0])
    print(' '.join(map(str, result[1])))

def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    sequence = [2 ** i for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` with `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. It generates a list of length equal to the number of tuples in `cases`, where each element in the list is a tuple `(25, [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608])`. The function does not modify the input parameters `t` and `cases`, and it returns the generated list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this data to extract the number of test cases (`t`) and the pairs of integers (`n` and `k`) for each test case.

2. **Generating Sequences**: The function `func_1` generates a fixed sequence of length 25, where each element is a power of 2 (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^24]`). This sequence is used for every test case.

3. **Conditions Check**:
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**: Since the sequence consists of powers of 2, no subsequence can sum to an odd number like `k` (assuming `k` is odd). For even `k`, the sequence does not contain enough elements to form `k` as a sum of distinct powers of 2.
   - **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**: Given the nature of powers of 2, any positive integer can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2. Therefore, the sequence can form all sums from 1 to `n-1` (since `k` is excluded).

4. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the length of the sequence (25) and the sequence itself for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements of the problem statement. It correctly generates a sequence of length 25 that satisfies the given conditions for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
