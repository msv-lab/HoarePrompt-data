### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this data to extract the number of test cases (`t`) and the pairs of integers (`n` and `k`) for each test case. This part is correct.

2. **Generating Sequences**:
   - The function `func_1` generates a fixed sequence of length 25, where each element is a power of 2 (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^24]`). However, this sequence is used for every test case, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

3. **Conditions Check**:
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
     - If `k` is an odd number, the sequence of powers of 2 will indeed not have a subsequence that sums to `k`, because the sum of distinct powers of 2 is always unique and cannot include an odd number of odd terms.
     - If `k` is an even number, the sequence of powers of 2 might still not cover all possible sums up to `k` because the sequence only includes powers of 2, which do not necessarily cover all even numbers up to `k`.
   - **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
     - The sequence of powers of 2 can indeed form all sums from 1 to `n-1` (since `k` is excluded), but only if `n` is small enough to be covered by the sum of the first 25 powers of 2. For larger `n`, the sequence may not be sufficient.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence (25) and the sequence itself for each test case. This part is correct.

### Evaluation:

- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program reads the input and generates a sequence of length 25. However, the assessment does not fully consider the limitations of the sequence of powers of 2 when `n` is large.
- For smaller values of `n`, the sequence of powers of 2 can indeed meet the conditions. However, for larger values of `n`, the sequence may not be sufficient to generate all sums from 1 to `n-1` except `k`.

Given the problem constraints, while the sequence of powers of 2 works for smaller `n`, it may fail for larger `n` due to the limited range of the sequence. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to work for all possible inputs within the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
