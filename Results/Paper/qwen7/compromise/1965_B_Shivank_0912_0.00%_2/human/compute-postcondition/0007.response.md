Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` with `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. It generates a list of length equal to the number of tuples in `cases`, where each element in the list is a tuple `(25, [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608])`. The function does not modify the input parameters `t` and `cases`, and it returns the generated list.**
