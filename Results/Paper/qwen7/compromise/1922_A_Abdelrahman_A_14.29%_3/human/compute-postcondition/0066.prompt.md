Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `slength` is an updated integer input, `a` is a new input string, `b` is the input from the user, `c` is the input from the user, `no` is True, `x` is the last character in `c`.
Code of the loop:
for x in c:
    if x not in a and x not in b:
        print('YES')
        no = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is the last character in `c`, `x` is not in `a` and `x` is not in `b`, `no` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is the second last character in `c`, `x` is not in `a`, `x` is not in `b`, `no` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is the last character in `c`, `c` is `c` without its last element, `x` is not in `a`, `x` is not in `b`, and `no` is False. If `x` is not found in both `a` and `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
