Output State: `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is the total number of iterations the loop ran, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is the entire input string, `no` is False, and `x` is the last character in `c`. If any character in `c` is not in `a` and not in `b`, we break out of the loop and print 'YES'.
