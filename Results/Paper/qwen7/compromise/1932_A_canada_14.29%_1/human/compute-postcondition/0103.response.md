Output State: **`ret` is the total count of '@' characters encountered in the list `s`, `thorn` is the cumulative count of '*' characters encountered without encountering another '*', and `s` is the list of characters after processing, `len` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `len = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `len`. However, none of the other variables (`ret`, `thorn`, and `s`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
