Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character (minus the first character), `ret` is 1 if the character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 1 or 3 depending on whether the character `i` is not '*', and `thorn` is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '*', otherwise `thorn` remains 0. If `i` is '@', `ret` is incremented by 1 and `thorn` is set to 0. If `i` is not '@', `ret` remains unchanged and `thorn` is incremented by 1 if it is not already 2, otherwise it remains 2.
