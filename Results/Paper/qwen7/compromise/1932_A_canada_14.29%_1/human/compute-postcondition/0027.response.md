Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character (minus the first character), `ret` is 1 if the character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `thorn = 0` sets the variable `thorn` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
