Postcondition: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list, and `thorn` is either 2, 1, or 0. If `i` equals '*', `thorn` becomes either 2 or 1 (based on its previous value) and if `i` does not equal '*', `thorn` is set to 0. Additionally, if `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
