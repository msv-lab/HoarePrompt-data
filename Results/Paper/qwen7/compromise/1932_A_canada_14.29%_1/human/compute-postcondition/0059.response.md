Output State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is equal to '@', `thorn` is 0, `ret` is 1**

Explanation: The code `ret += 1` increments the value of `ret` by 1. Since `ret` was initially 0, after executing this line, `ret` becomes 1. The other variables (`s` and `i`) remain unchanged.
