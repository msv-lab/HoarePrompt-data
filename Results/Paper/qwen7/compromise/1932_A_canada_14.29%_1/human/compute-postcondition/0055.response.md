Output State: **`ret` is 0, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input, `thorn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The variable `thorn` is explicitly set to 0, overriding its previous value which was the count of '*' characters in the list `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
