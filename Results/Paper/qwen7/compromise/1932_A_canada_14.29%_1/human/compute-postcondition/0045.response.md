Output State: **`thorn` is 0**

Explanation: The code `thorn == 0` is an equality check and does not assign any new value to `thorn`. It only evaluates whether `thorn` is equal to 0. Since the initial state of `thorn` is either 1 or 3, and the code does not change its value, the value of `thorn` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `thorn` is 0, considering the possible initial values and the fact that no assignment operation was performed.
