Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the list `s` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
   - `len` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character.
   - `ret` is 1 if the character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0.
   - `thorn` is either 0 or 2 depending on whether the character `i` is not '*'.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in the list `s`, the variable `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
   - The list `s` will be reduced by one element after each iteration since the loop is processing one character per iteration.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
- `s` will be the list `s` minus the first element (the current `i`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character (minus the first character), `ret` is 1 if the character `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 0 or 2 depending on whether the character `i` is not '*'**.
