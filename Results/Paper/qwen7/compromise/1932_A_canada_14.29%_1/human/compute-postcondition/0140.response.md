Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the second character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` is 0 if `i` is not '*', and 1 if `i` is '*'.
   - `ret` is 1 if `i` is '*', and `ret` is either `i` + 1 if `i` is '*' and `thorn` equals 2, or `ret` remains 0 if `i` is not '*'.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second character in the list `s`, the next character in the list `s` will be the third character.
   - `thorn` will be updated based on whether the new `i` (the third character) is '*'.
   - `ret` will be updated based on the value of `i` and the current value of `thorn`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will now be the third character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` will be 0 if the third character is not '*', and 1 if it is '*'.
   - `ret` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and `thorn`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `i` becomes the third character in the list `s`.
- `thorn` is 0 if the third character is not '*', and 1 if it is '*'.
- `ret` is updated based on the new value of `i` and `thorn`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is the third character in the list `s`, `thorn` is 0 if the third character is not '*', and 1 if it is '*', and `ret` is updated based on the new value of `i` and `thorn`.**
