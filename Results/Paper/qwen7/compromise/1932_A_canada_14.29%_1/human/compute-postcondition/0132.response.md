Output State: **`i` is the second character in the list `s`, `thorn` is `i` + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code snippet, the values of `i` and `thorn` remain unchanged.
