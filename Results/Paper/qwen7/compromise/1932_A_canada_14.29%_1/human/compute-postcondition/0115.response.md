Output State: **`s` is a non-empty list of characters, `i` is the first character in the list `s`, and `i` is not '@', and the current value of `i` is '*', `thorn` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `thorn` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was set to '*', and since no other operations affect `i` or `s`, these remain unchanged. The only change is that `thorn` is now 1.
