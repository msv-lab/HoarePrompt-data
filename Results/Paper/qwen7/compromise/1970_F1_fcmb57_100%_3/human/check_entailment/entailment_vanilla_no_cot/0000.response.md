Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function `func_1` is not used correctly**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called with the correct arguments. Instead, the player's position is updated directly using tuple addition without calling the function. This should be corrected to use `func_1`.

2. **Handling of catching the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the scenario where a player catches the Quaffle. When a player catches the Quaffle, the Quaffle should be placed at the player's current position, and the player should no longer carry the Quaffle.

3. **Updating the player's position after catching or throwing**: After a player catches or throws the Quaffle, their position should be updated accordingly. The current implementation does not account for this.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..' or s[x] == '.Q':
            continue
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
quaffle_position = None
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        (x, y) = players[mo[0]]
        (dx, dy) = mouvements[mo[1]]
        new_position = (x + dx, y + dy)
        if 0 <= new_position[0] < m and 0 <= new_position[1] < n:
            players[mo[0]] = new_position
            if quaffle_position and quaffle_position == new_position:
                # Player is now carrying the Quaffle
                players[mo[0]] = (new_position[0], new_position[1])
                quaffle_position = None
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        (x, y) = players[mo[0]]
        if mo[2] == '.Q':
            quaffle_position = (x, y)
            players[mo[0]] = (x, y)
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        (x, y) = players[mo[0]]
        if quaffle_position and quaffle_position == (x, y):
            if (x, y) in goals['R']:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
                quaffle_position = (m // 2, n // 2)
            elif (x, y) in goals['B']:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
                quaffle_position = (m // 2, n // 2)
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

This corrected version ensures that the player's position is updated correctly when they move, catch the Quaffle, or throw it.
