Precondition: **a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, each string containing M characters, and each character can be one of the following: '.', 'R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9', 'RG', 'BG', or '.Q'. The value of T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, and the subsequent T lines describe the actions performed by entities on the field.**
