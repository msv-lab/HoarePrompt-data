Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(10, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the given conditions. The loop will start with `i` set to 10 and increment `i` until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 10 for the loop to start.

4. **Adjust the state of `total`, `numbers`, `values`, and `sum_values`**: These lists and the variable `total` are not directly related to the loop condition. They remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

Given this analysis, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should start at 10, and `n` must be at least 10 for the loop to execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 10, `n` must be at least 10**
