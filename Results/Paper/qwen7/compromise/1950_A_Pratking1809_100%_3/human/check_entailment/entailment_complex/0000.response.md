Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given set of three digits forms a 'STAIR', a 'PEAK', or neither. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is done correctly using a loop that iterates `q` times, where `q` is the value of `t`.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()`, which is then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This part is also correct.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if true.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if true.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.

4. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate label for each test case directly to the console, which matches the problem requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases appropriately, including when `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal (which would result in 'NONE') and when the digits are at the boundary values (0 and 9).

Given that the program correctly implements the logic and handles all possible inputs as per the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
