Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads input from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which is a way to read lines from stdin. This is fine as long as the input format matches the expected format.

2. **Variable Extraction**:
   - It extracts `k`, `x`, and `a` from each line using `map(int, s.split())`. This is correct as per the problem statement.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal:
     - **Case 1**: `x < k - 1`
       - If Sasha can lose fewer times than the number of times his bet would increase in a win, and he has enough coins to cover one loss plus one win, he can achieve any number of coins.
       - This logic is correct because Sasha can use a simple strategy to ensure he can recover from a loss and continue winning.
     - **Case 2**: `x == k - 1`
       - If Sasha can lose exactly one less time than the number of times his bet would increase in a win, and he has enough coins to cover two losses, he can achieve any number of coins.
       - This logic is also correct for the same reason as above.
     - **Case 3**: `x > k - 1`
       - For larger values of `x`, the program calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can recover from a series of losses and continue winning.
       - The formula used in the loop is `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`, which is a way to calculate the required number of coins to cover a sequence of losses and wins.
       - This logic is correct as well because it ensures Sasha can recover from a series of losses and continue increasing his coins.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked. This is correct as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can see that it correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal based on the given constraints. The conditions and calculations are accurate according to the problem description.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
