Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an integer equal to the first number in the string `s`.
- `x` is an integer equal to the second number in the string `s`.
- `a` is an integer equal to the third number in the string `s`.
- `s` is the second line of the input (a string).
- The current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.

The code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
