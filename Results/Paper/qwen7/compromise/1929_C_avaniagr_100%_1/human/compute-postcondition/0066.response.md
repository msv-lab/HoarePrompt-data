Postcondition: **`k` is `s` split and converted to int and decreased by 2, `x` is the second value of `s` split and converted to int and must be greater than `k - 3`, `a` is the third value of `s` split and converted to int, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x - k + 3` times, and in both cases (`a >= z` and `a < z`), `z` will be the initial value of `z` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration.**
