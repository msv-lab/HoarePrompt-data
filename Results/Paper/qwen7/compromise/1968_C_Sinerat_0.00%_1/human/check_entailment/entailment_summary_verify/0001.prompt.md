You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then calculates a list `a` where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of 500 and the first `i+1` elements of `x`. Finally, it prints the list `a` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
Given an array \( x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n \), we need to find an array \( a_1, \ldots, a_n \) such that:
- \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \) for all \( 1 \leq i \leq n \).
- \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \leq i \leq n \).

### Provided Program Analysis
The provided program is as follows:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and the array \( x \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - An array `a` of size \( n \) is initialized with zeros.
   - The first element \( a[0] \) is set to 500.

3. **Filling the Array:**
   - For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \), the program sets \( a[i] \) to \( a[i-1] + x[i-1] \).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `a`.

### Checking the Solution Against the Problem Requirements

1. **Bounds Check:**
   - The solution ensures that \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \). This is satisfied since \( a_i \) is constructed by adding positive integers up to 500 to the initial value of 500.

2. **Modulo Condition:**
   - The condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) needs to be checked.
   - Given \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x[i-1] \), we have:
     \[
     a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x[i-1]) \bmod a_{i-1} = x[i-1]
     \]
   - This matches the requirement \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \).

### Example Verification

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - \( n = 4 \)
   - \( x = [2, 4, 1] \)
   - \( a = [500, 502, 506, 507] \)
   - Verify:
     - \( 502 \bmod 500 = 2 \)
     - \( 506 \bmod 502 = 4 \)
     - \( 507 \bmod 506 = 1 \)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - \( n = 3 \)
   - \( x = [1, 1] \)
   - \( a = [500, 501, 502] \)
   - Verify:
     - \( 501 \bmod 500 = 1 \)
     - \( 502 \bmod 501 = 1 \)

Both examples satisfy the conditions.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate an array \( a \) that satisfies the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
