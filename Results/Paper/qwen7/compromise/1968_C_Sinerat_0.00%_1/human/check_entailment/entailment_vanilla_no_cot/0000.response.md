Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program initializes `a[0]` to 500 and then sets each subsequent element `a[i]` to be the previous element `a[i-1]` plus `x[i-1]`. However, this approach does not guarantee that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

To satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`, we need to ensure that `a_i` is chosen such that when divided by `a_{i-1}`, the remainder is `x_i`. A correct approach would involve setting `a_i` to be at least `a_{i-1} + x_i` to ensure the modulo condition is met. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1  # Start with a[0] as 1, can be any positive integer but 1 simplifies calculations
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

This version ensures that `a_i` is at least `a_{i-1} + x_i`, which guarantees that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`. However, it's important to note that multiple solutions may exist, and this is just one possible solution.
