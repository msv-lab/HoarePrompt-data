Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, `a[0]` is 500.**

The code `a[0] = 500` assigns the value 500 to the first element of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
