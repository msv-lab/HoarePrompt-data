Output State: **`_` is the current value of the loop counter plus 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of `n` zeros where the first element is 500.**

In this case, the code `a[0] = 500` changes the value of the first element in the list `a` to 500. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
