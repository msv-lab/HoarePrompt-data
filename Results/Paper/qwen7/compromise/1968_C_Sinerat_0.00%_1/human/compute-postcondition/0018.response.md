Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, `a[0]` is 500.**

Explanation: The code sets the first element of the list `a` to 500. All other elements of `a` remain as zeros, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `x` are unchanged.
