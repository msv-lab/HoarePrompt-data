Output State: **`_` is the current value of the loop counter plus 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in `x`. The values of `_` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
