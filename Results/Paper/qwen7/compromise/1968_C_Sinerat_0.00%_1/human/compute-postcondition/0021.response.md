Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until it is no longer less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a[i]` is equal to `a[0] + x[0]`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as long as it is still greater than 1.
   - The value of `a[i]` will be updated to `a[0] + x[0]` when `i` becomes 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `a[2]` will be equal to `a[0] + x[0]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[2]` is equal to `a[0] + x[0]`**
