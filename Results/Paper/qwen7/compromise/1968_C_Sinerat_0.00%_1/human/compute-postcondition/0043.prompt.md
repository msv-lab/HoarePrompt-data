Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [0] * n
    a[0] = 500
    for i in range(1, n):
        a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of all previous elements in the list `x` up to index `i-1` added to 500.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The loop will execute for all integers \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\). After all iterations, the list `a` will be transformed such that each element `a[i]` (for \(0 \leq i < n\)) will be the sum of 500 and the cumulative sum of the first \(i\) elements of the list `x`. In other words, `a[i]` will be equal to `500 + sum(x[:i+1])`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the final state of `a` will be a list where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the sum of 500 and all the previous elements in `x` up to that point.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a[i]` is equal to `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`. This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be one less than `n`, `n` must still be greater than 1, and the last element of list `a` (which is `a[n-1]`) will be the sum of the previous element `a[n-2]` and the corresponding element from list `x` (which is `x[n-2]`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
