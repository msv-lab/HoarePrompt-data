Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, splits the line into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores them in a list called `x`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
