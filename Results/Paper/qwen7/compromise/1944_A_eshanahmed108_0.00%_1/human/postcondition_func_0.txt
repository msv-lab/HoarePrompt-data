The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it prints \( n \) if the difference between \( n \) and \( k \) is less than or equal to 1; otherwise, it prints 1. The function reads the number of test cases from the first line of input and then reads the values of \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case. The final state of the program is a series of printed outputs based on the given condition.
