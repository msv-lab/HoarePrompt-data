Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. In such cases, even though the program prints `1`, the correct answer should be `n` because all bridges can be destroyed, allowing Everule to still visit all islands including island 1. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4 4
```
Here, `n = 4` and `k = 4`. According to the problem description, if `k` is equal to or greater than `n-1`, Everule can still visit all islands. However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `4`.

To fix this, the condition should be updated to ensure that if `k >= n - 1`, the result should be `n`.
