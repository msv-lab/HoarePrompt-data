Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it takes two integers n and m, followed by n pairs of integers (a_i, b_i). It returns a value based on the conditions given for each test case.**

This means the function `func_2` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves processing two integers \( n \) and \( m \), followed by \( n \) pairs of integers \( (a_i, b_i) \). The function does not take any parameters explicitly but operates on the data provided within the test cases, ensuring that for each test case, it adheres to the specified constraints and returns a value accordingly.
