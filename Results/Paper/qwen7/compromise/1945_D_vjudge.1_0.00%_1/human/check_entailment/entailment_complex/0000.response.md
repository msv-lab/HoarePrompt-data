Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes the necessary variables and reads the input as per the problem statement.
   - It reverses the input lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` which seems unnecessary since the problem doesn't specify any specific order for processing.
   - The logic inside the loop iterates through the first `n-k` elements of `lista_A` and `lista_B`, calculating the prefix sum `pref` and the cumulative sum `soma_b` appropriately.
   - The function correctly computes the minimum cost required to move Kirill to a position within the top `m` positions by considering the costs associated with moving past each person.
   - The final result is computed correctly and printed.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each one.
   - It processes each test case as expected and prints the result for each test case.
   - The overall structure and logic of the function match the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, both functions together correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. They handle the input, process the data according to the rules, and produce the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
