Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in how it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions. Specifically, the function `func_1` incorrectly handles the cumulative costs and does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all possible moves.

Here's a brief breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Reverse Order**: The code reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem's requirements.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cumulative costs (`pref` and `soma_b`) is flawed. It doesn't properly account for the costs incurred when moving Kirill to different positions.
3. **Final Cost Calculation**: The final cost calculation in the loop where it tries to find the minimum cost is also incorrect.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use dynamic programming or a similar approach to keep track of the minimum cost for each position up to `m`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [float('inf')] * (k + 1)
    dp[0] = 0

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(min(i + 1, k), 0, -1):
            dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j - 1] + (A[i] if j <= i else B[i]))

    print(dp[k])

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

# Example usage
func_2()
```

This corrected version uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions. It iterates through each position in the queue and updates the DP table accordingly.
