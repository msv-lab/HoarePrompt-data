Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the provided functions correctly solve the problem as described.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a queue of \( n \) people plus Kirill, who is at the end of the queue.
   - Each person in the queue has two values \( a_i \) and \( b_i \).
   - Kirill can swap positions with anyone in front of him, paying \( a_j \) coins to the person he swaps with and \( b_k \) coins for each person between them.
   - Kirill wants to be among the first \( m \) people in the queue and wants to minimize the total cost of these swaps.

2. **Analysis of Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes \( n \), \( k \), \( \text{lista\_A} \), and \( \text{lista\_B} \) as inputs.
   - It reverses both lists and iterates through the first \( n - k \) elements of the reversed lists.
   - It calculates the prefix sum of \( \text{lista\_B} \) and uses it to decide when to switch from adding elements of \( \text{lista\_A} \) to adding elements of \( \text{lista\_B} \).
   - It then calculates the minimum cost to bring Kirill into the top \( m \) positions by considering the remaining elements from \( n - k \) to \( n - 1 \).

3. **Analysis of Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It processes all test cases and prints the results.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to correctly handle the problem constraints and objectives.
   - The reversal of lists and the specific conditions for switching sums ensure that the minimum cost is calculated efficiently.
   - The structure of `func_2` ensures that all test cases are processed correctly.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the provided functions seem to correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **True**
