Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is an index, `a` is a list of integers, `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 1`, `s` is a string that now includes the character corresponding to `j` in the alphabet. This is because either `char_count[j]` equals `a[i] + 1` and the character corresponding to `j` is added to `s`, or the condition `char_count[j] == a[i]` is false and no additional changes are made to `s`.
