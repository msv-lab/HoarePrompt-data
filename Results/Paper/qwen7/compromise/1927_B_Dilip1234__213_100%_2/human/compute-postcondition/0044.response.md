Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n` (since `j` is initialized within the loop but `n` is used in the `range` function).

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - `i` is given as `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than `n` (which is an invalid condition, likely meant to be `n > 0`).

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `j` in `range(26)`, meaning `j` will take values from 0 to 25.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a valid positive integer because `range(n)` requires `n` to be a non-negative integer.
   - Since `i` is already set to `n`, no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Therefore, the only variable that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
