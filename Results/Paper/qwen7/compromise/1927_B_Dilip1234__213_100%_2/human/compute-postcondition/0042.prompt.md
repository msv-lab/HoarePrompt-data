Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before, `a` is the same as before, `char_count` is the same as before, and `s` is the final value of `s` from the previous iteration.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(26):
    if char_count[j] == a[i]:
        s += chr(j + ord('a'))
        char_count[j] += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0, and if `char_count[0]` equals `a[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `char_count[0]` does not equal `a[i]`, no change occurs to `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 1, unless `char_count[j] == a[i]`, in which case `j` becomes 2 and `s` is set to 'b'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `s` is 'c', and `char_count[2]` is either 1 (if the condition `char_count[j] == a[i]` is true and the loop is broken) or remains unchanged (if the condition is false).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
