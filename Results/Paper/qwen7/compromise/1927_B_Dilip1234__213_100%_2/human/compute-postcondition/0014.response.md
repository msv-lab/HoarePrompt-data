Postcondition: `char_count[j + 1]` equals `a[i] + 1` if the condition `char_count[j + 1] == a[i]` was true, otherwise it remains unchanged; `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1; `s` is the string formed by adding the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` to the previous value of `s`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
