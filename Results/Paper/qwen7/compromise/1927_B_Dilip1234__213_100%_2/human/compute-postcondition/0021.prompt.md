Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i < n, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros
Code of the loop:
for j in range(26):
    if char_count[j] == a[i]:
        s += chr(j + ord('a'))
        char_count[j] += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `char_count[j]` equals either `a[i] + 1` or remains unchanged, depending on whether the condition `char_count[j] == a[i]` is true. If true, `s` is a string containing the character corresponding to the index `j` in the alphabet and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `char_count[j + 1]` equals `a[i] + 1` if the condition `char_count[j + 1] == a[i]` was true, otherwise it remains unchanged; `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1; `s` is the string formed by adding the character `chr(j + ord('a'))` to the previous value of `s`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is incremented by 1; if `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `s` is updated to the current value of `s` plus the character corresponding to `j + 1` in the alphabet starting from 'a', and `char_count[j]` is increased by 1. If `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`, no changes are made to `s` and `char_count[j]` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
