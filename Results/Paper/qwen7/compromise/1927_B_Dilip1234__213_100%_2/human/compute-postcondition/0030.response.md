Let's think through this step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(26)`. The only variable involved here is `j`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range of 0 to 25 (inclusive). Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute until `j` reaches 25.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: The current state is `j` is 0. This means that the loop has just started or it has completed its first iteration.

4. **Next Iteration State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from 0 to 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 1.

5. **Postcondition Check**: The postcondition mentioned does not affect the value of `j` directly. It only affects the loop's behavior based on the condition inside the loop body. However, since the loop continues to execute as long as `j` is within the specified range, the postcondition does not change the value of `j` itself but rather the outcome of the loop execution.

Given the above reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`j` is 1**
