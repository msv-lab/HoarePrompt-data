Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `a` is a list of integers, `char_count[j]` is either incremented by 1 or remains equal to `a[i] + 2` if the condition `char_count[j] == a[i]` is met, `s` is a string that now includes the character corresponding to `j` in the alphabet.**
