Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`. It returns a string `s` where each letter from 'a' to 'z' appears a number of times determined by the values in `a` and the increments made to `char_count` during the loop's execution.**
