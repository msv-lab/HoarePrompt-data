Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`; `s` is the current value of `s` plus the character corresponding to `j + 1` in the alphabet starting from 'a'; `char_count[j]` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no changes are made to the variables `j`, `s`, and `char_count[j]` within the scope of the `break` statement, their values remain as they were in the initial state. The `break` statement simply indicates that the program will exit the current loop or conditional block.
