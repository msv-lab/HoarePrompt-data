Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
1. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the main logic. Instead, the movement is directly applied using dictionary lookup. This is unnecessary and can be removed.

2. **Bludger Handling**: The code does not handle the Bludger correctly. Specifically, when a player is eliminated due to a Bludger, the code should check if the player is holding the Quaffle and update the Quaffle's position accordingly. The current implementation does not handle this scenario properly.

3. **Player Elimination**: When a player is eliminated, the code should check if the player is holding the Quaffle and update the Quaffle's position. The current implementation does not do this.

4. **Quaffle Position Update**: The Quaffle's position should be updated correctly when a player throws it. The current implementation sets `quidditch[1]` to an empty string, which is incorrect.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        (x, y) = players[mo[0]]
        (dx, dy) = mouvements[mo[1]]
        players[mo[0]] = (x + dx, y + dy)
        if '.B' in players:
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                    if quidditch[1] == k:
                        quidditch = [v, '']
                    del players[k]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                quidditch[0] = middle
            else:
                quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                quidditch[0] = middle
            else:
                quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

This corrected version handles the elimination of players and updates the Quaffle's position correctly.
