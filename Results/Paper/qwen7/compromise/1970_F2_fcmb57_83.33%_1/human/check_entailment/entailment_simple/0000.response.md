### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions and reads the initial state of the field, including players, goals, and the Quaffle. It also correctly identifies the middle of the field and stores the initial positions of the Quaffle and Bludgers.

2. **Movement and Action Handling**:
   - The program handles movements (`ULDR`) and actions (`C`, `T`) correctly. For each action, it updates the positions of players and the Quaffle appropriately.
   - The program checks for collisions with Bludgers and eliminates players accordingly.
   - The program correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player throws it and handles scoring scenarios.

3. **Event Logging**:
   - The program logs events such as scoring and player elimination correctly. It ensures that events are printed in the correct order and format.
   - The final score is calculated and printed correctly.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined and used correctly to update player positions based on movement commands. It adds the movement vector to the player's current position and returns the new position as a tuple.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly based on the provided input and expected behavior.

### Correctness:
**True**
