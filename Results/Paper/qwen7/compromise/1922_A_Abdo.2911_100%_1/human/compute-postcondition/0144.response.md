Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is True**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `possible` and retains the initial conditions for `i` and `n`.
