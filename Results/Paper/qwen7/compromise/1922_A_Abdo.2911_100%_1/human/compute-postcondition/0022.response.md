Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and the elements at index `i` of arrays `a` and `b` are not equal, and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]`; `possible` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is not inside any loop or conditional block, it simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible` remain unchanged from their initial states.
