Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and the elements at index `i` of arrays `a` and `b` are not equal. The value of `c[0]` is either equal to `a[0]` or `b[0]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c` within the scope of the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the conditions and values specified in the initial state still hold true after the execution of the `continue` statement.
