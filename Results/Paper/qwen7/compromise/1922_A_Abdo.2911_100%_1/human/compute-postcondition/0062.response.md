Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` remains `False`, `b` is the stripped input string.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes user input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from it, and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, `possible`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
