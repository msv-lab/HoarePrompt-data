Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`.**

Explanation: The code sets `possible` to `True`. Since `i` was initially `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The value of `possible` is explicitly set to `True`, so no further checks are needed for its value.
