Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(n)` function.
   - The variable `n` remains as the input integer.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Therefore, `i` should start from 0 and `n` should be a positive integer (since `t` is given as a positive integer, we can assume `n` is also a positive integer).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be set to 0.
   - `n` needs to be a positive integer.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. They can remain in their current state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**
