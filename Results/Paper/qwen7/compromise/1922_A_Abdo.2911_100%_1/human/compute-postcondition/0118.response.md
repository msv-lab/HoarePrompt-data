Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` is the same as the previous iteration, `t` is `t - 1`**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `possible`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` remains as `n + 1`, `n` is now the input integer, `possible` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `t` is decremented by 1.
