Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `possible` remains `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` remains `False`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

1. The value of `i` is `n + 1`.
2. Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 1.
3. The value of `possible` is determined by the conditions involving `c[i]`, `a[i]`, and `b[i]`. However, since `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is greater than 0, `c[i]`, `a[i]`, and `b[i]` do not exist (they are out of bounds for any valid list with length `n`).

Because `c[i]`, `a[i]`, and `b[i]` do not exist, the conditions for setting `possible` to `True` cannot be met. Therefore, `possible` must be `False`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. 

Output: **YES**
