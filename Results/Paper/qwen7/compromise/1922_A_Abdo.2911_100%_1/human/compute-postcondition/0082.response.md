Postcondition: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]` at the current position, otherwise `possible` remains `False`. `b` and `c` are the stripped input strings, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `possible` becomes `True`.**
