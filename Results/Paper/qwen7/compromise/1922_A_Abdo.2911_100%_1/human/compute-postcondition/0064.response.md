Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` is `False`, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string.**

The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `possible`. Since `i` is initially `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` was initially `False`, `b` is the stripped input string, and `c` is the stripped input string, these values remain unchanged.
