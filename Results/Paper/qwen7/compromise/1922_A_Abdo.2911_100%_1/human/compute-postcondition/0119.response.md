Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` is the same as the previous iteration, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is the stripped input value from user.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `n`, `possible`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
