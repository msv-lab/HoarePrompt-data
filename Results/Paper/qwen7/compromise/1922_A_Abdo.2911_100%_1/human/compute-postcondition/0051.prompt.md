Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the string input by the user without any leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the string input by the user without any leading or trailing spaces, `c` is the string input by the user without any leading or trailing spaces, and the leading or trailing spaces of `c` have been removed; `possible` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        if c[i] != a[i]:
            possible = True
            break
    elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
        continue
    else:
        possible = True
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and if the elements at index 0 of arrays `a` and `b` are equal, `possible` remains unchanged and `c[0]` is neither equal to `a[0]` nor `b[0]`. If the elements at index 0 of arrays `a` and `b` are not equal, `c[0]` is set to the value of either `a[0]` or `b[0]` (whichever is not equal to the other), and `possible` is set to True with the most internal loop or if statement being broken out.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. If `c[1]` is not equal to `a[1]`, then `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `c[1]` is equal to `a[1]` or `c[1]` is equal to `b[1]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is True and the loop or if statement is broken out of.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer. If `c[2]` is not equal to `a[2]`, then `possible` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `c[2]` equals `a[2]` or `c[2]` equals `b[2]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
