Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. According to the problem description, the goal is to fill the matrix such that the sum of all elements is maximized using no more than 2n operations. However, the program simply initializes the matrix with a sequence of numbers and calculates a sum based on a formula without actually performing the required operations.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  2
  2
  ```

Expected output:
- For \( n = 2 \), the maximum sum is 7, and it can be achieved by performing the following operations:
  ```
  1 1 1 2
  1 2 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  ```

However, the provided program outputs:
- ```
  7 4
  1 1 1 2
  1 2 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  2 2 1 2
  ```

Notice that the last operation is unnecessary because the matrix is already filled correctly after the first three operations. This means the program performs more operations than necessary, which violates the requirement of using no more than 2n operations.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix within the specified constraints, making it incorrect.
