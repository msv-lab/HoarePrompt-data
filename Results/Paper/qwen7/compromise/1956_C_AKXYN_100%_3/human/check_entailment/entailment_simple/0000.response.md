Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix elements using up to 2n operations.
2. The annotated program initializes a matrix `mat` with values ranging from 1 to n for each row, which is a valid operation.
3. The variable `res` is calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for each row index `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This calculation is based on the sum of the first `n` odd numbers, which is `n^2`. However, the actual implementation sums these values, which is equivalent to `n^2`.
4. The program prints the result `res` (which is `n^2`) and `2 * n` as the number of operations.
5. For each row index `i` from `n` down to 1, the program performs two operations:
   - A Type 1 operation that sets the entire `i-th` row to the sequence `1, 2, ..., n`.
   - A Type 2 operation that sets the entire `i-th` column to the sequence `1, 2, ..., n`.

Given the problem constraints and the operations performed, the program correctly calculates the maximum possible sum (`n^2`) and performs the required operations within the limit of 2n operations.

Correctness: **True**
