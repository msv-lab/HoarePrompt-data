### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
   - The problem specifies that the maximum possible sum can always be achieved in no more than \(2n\) operations.

2. **Matrix Initialization**:
   - The given program initializes the matrix `mat` such that each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\). This is done correctly using `list(range(1, n + 1))` for each row.
   - However, the matrix `mat` is not actually used in the subsequent operations. Instead, the program directly prints permutations of integers from 1 to \(n\) without modifying the matrix.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the matrix elements using the formula \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1)\), which simplifies to \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i^2 + 3i + 1)\).
   - This formula is derived from the fact that each element \(a_{i,j}\) will eventually be set to a value from 1 to \(n\), and the sum of all elements in the matrix will be the sum of all integers from 1 to \(n^2\).
   - The calculation is correct, but the actual matrix is not being modified to achieve this sum.

4. **Operations Execution**:
   - The program prints the required number of operations (which is \(2n\)) to achieve the maximum sum. It performs \(n\) row operations and \(n\) column operations, each setting the elements to a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\).
   - However, these operations do not actually change the matrix `mat`. Instead, they print the same permutation repeatedly, which does not affect the sum of the matrix.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the details of each operation. The format matches the requirements of the problem.
   - However, the operations printed do not correspond to any actual changes in the matrix.

### Conclusion:
The program does not actually modify the matrix to achieve the maximum sum. Instead, it prints the same permutation repeatedly, which does not change the matrix. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as specified.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
