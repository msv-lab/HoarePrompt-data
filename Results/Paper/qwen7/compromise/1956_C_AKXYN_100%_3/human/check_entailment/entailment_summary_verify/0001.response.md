Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Matrix Initialization**: The given program initializes the matrix `mat` such that each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\). This is done correctly using `list(range(1, n + 1))` for each row.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of the matrix elements. The formula used is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1)\), which simplifies to \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i^2 + 3i + 1)\). However, this formula is incorrect. The correct sum of all elements in the matrix after performing the operations should be \(n^2 \times \frac{n+1}{2}\), which is the sum of the first \(n^2\) natural numbers.
4. **Operations Execution**: The program prints the required number of operations (which is \(2n\)) to achieve the maximum sum. It performs \(n\) row operations and \(n\) column operations, each setting the elements to a permutation of integers from 1 to \(n\). This part is correct.
5. **Output Format**: The program outputs the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the details of each operation. The format matches the requirements of the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program incorrectly calculates the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct sum should be \(n^2 \times \frac{n+1}{2}\), but the program uses a different formula, leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
