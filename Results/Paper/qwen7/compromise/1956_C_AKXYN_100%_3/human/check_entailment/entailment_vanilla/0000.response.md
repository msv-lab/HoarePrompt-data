### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with zeros.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Permute the elements in a chosen row.
     - Type 2: Permute the elements in a chosen column.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution initializes a matrix `mat` where each row is filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The sum of the matrix is calculated using a formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \).
   - The solution prints the maximum possible sum and the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \).
   - It then performs the operations in reverse order, setting each row and column to their respective permutations.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The sum calculation seems correct based on the problem's requirements.
   - The operations are performed in such a way that each element in the matrix is set to its maximum possible value (1 to \( n \)).
   - The number of operations is exactly \( 2n \), which matches the problem's constraint.

4. **Validation:**
   - For \( n = 1 \):
     - The sum is \( 1 \) and one operation is needed.
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - The sum is \( 7 \) and three operations are needed.
   - The provided examples in the problem statement confirm the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It calculates the maximum sum and performs the required operations within the specified constraints.

**Correctness: True**
