Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is explicitly given as 204.
- `n` is greater than 9, and in this case, it is specified as 9.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), but its value is not relevant to the print statement execution.

The print statement is:
```python
print(res, n << 1)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `res` is explicitly given as 204.
- `n` is 9.
- The expression `n << 1` is a bitwise left shift operation, which shifts the bits of `n` to the left by 1 position. For `n = 9`, which is `1001` in binary, shifting left by 1 position results in `10010` in binary, which is 18 in decimal.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **204 18**
