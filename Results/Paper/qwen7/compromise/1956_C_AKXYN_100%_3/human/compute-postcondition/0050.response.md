Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is 2; `mat` is [[1], [2]]; `res` is 0**

The code initializes the variable `res` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `i`, `n`, or `mat`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `res` and the unchanged values of `i`, `n`, and `mat`.
