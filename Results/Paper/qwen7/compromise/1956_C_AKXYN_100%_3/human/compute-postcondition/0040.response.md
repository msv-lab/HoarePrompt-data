Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is `n`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3

### Loop Head
- The loop is defined as `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`

### Analysis
1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.
3. **Loop Direction**: The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration (`-1` step).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Current State**:
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `i` is initially `n`, and the loop decrements `i` by 1 each time, `i` will be `n-1` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `n` must remain greater than or equal to 4 (since `n-1` must be greater than 0).

### Updated State
- `i` will be `n-1` in the next iteration.
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
