Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `res` is 1
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `mat` is a list of lists where each inner list contains integers from 1 to `n`
   - `i` is 0
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.
4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still satisfy the condition \(i < n\). Given that `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `res` remains 1
- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\)
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 1

So, the updated state is:
State: **`res` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
