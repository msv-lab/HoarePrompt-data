Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(n, 0, -1):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Given the initial values, `i` starts at 1 and `n` is 2.

3. **Determine the change in `i`**: Since the loop is decrementing `i` by 1 each iteration (`-1` step size), at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 0.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be greater than or equal to 0. Since `i` will be 0 at the start of the next iteration, the loop will indeed execute one more time.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the value of `i` to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper bound of the range and does not change within the loop.

Given these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is 2**
