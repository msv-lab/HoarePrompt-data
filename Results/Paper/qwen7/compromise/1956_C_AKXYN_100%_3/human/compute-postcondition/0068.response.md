Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Execution:**
   - `'2 %d' % i`: This part of the code uses string formatting. Since `i` is 0, it will replace `%d` with `0`. So, this part becomes `'2 0'`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)`: The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n + 1 - 1`, which is 2. Using the unpacking operator `*`, these numbers are passed as separate arguments to the `print` function. Therefore, `range(1, n + 1)` results in `[1, 2]`.

4. **Combining the Results:**
   - The `print` function combines the formatted string `'2 0'` with the numbers generated by `range(1, n + 1)`, resulting in the output `'2 0 1 2'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **2 0 1 2**
