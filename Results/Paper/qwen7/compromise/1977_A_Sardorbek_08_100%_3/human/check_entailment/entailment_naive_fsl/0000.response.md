Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program checks if `b` (the number of moves) is equal to `c` (the desired number of cubes), or if `b` is less than `c`, and then prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. However, it also includes a condition where it checks if `b % 2 == c % 2` and prints 'Yes', which is incorrect.

For example, consider the case where `n = 5` and `m = 3`. According to the problem description, Nikita can perform 5 moves to end up with 3 cubes. This is possible by adding 3 cubes and removing 2 cubes. However, the program incorrectly prints 'Yes' because `5 % 2 == 3 % 2` evaluates to `False`, but it still prints 'Yes' due to the incorrect placement of the condition.

A correct implementation would check if the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is even, as the total number of added and removed cubes must result in an even difference.
