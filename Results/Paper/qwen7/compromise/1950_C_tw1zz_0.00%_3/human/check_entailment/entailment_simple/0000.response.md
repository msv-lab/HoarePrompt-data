Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. The program then converts the 24-hour format to 12-hour format by checking the value of `h` and setting `h1` accordingly. It also sets the `time` variable to either "AM" or "PM".
4. However, there are more efficient and concise ways to handle this conversion, such as using modulo arithmetic and conditional logic.
5. Despite the inefficiency, the logic used in the program is correct for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format and determining whether it is AM or PM.
6. The program prints the converted time in the correct format "h1 : m  time".

Given these points, the program logic is correct and will produce the expected output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
