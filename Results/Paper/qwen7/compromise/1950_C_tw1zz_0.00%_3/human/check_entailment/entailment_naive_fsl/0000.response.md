Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the conversion of hours correctly for all cases. Specifically, it fails to convert hours from 13 to 23 to their corresponding 12-hour format. For example, the input `13:00` should be converted to `01:00 PM`, but the program incorrectly handles this case. Here's a detailed breakdown:

- For `13:00`, the program should set `h1` to `'01'` and `time` to `'PM'`.
- However, the program does not have a specific condition for `13` and instead relies on the general conditions for `13` to `23`, which leads to incorrect handling.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the conversion for hours 13 to 23 more explicitly. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        (h1, m1) = (h, m)
        time = ''
        if int(h) <= 12:
            if int(h) == 12:
                h1 = '12'
                time = 'PM'
            else:
                h1 = h
                time = 'AM'
        else:
            h1 = str((int(h) - 12))
            time = 'PM'
        print(h1, ':', m1, ' ', time, sep='')
```

This corrected version ensures that all hours from 13 to 23 are correctly converted to their 12-hour equivalents.
