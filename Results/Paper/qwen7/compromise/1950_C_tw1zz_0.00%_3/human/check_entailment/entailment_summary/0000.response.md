Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. However, there are several issues with the logic used in the program:

1. **Redundant Code**: The program uses multiple `elif` statements to handle different cases of the hour. This can be simplified using a more efficient approach.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Midnight**: The program incorrectly handles the '00' hour as '12 PM' instead of '12 AM'.
3. **AM/PM Assignment**: The AM/PM assignment logic is flawed. For example, it assigns 'AM' to '13' and 'PM' to '14', which should be 'PM' and 'PM' respectively.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = int(h) % 12
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        if h1 == 0:
            h1 = 12
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')
```

This version correctly handles all cases and simplifies the logic.

Given these issues, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
