Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the 12-hour format with AM/PM notation, derived from the input times in the 24-hour format. The specific times printed depend on the inputs provided during the loop's execution. Each line will follow the format "h1 : m  time", where "h1" is the hour converted to the 12-hour format, "m" is the original minutes, and "time" is either "AM" or "PM".
