Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It then reads the encoded value `n` for each test case.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - The program aims to decode the integer `n` back into a three-letter word.
   - The logic is divided into different cases based on the value of `n`.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: `n > 52`
     - Here, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
     - This handles words like "rzz" (where `n = 70`).
   - **Case 2**: `n > 27`
     - Here, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
     - This handles words like "czz" (where `n = 55`).
   - **Case 3**: `n == 27`
     - Here, the word is explicitly set to `'aay'`.
   - **Case 4**: `n <= 26`
     - Here, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
     - This handles words like "aaa" (where `n = 3`).

4. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest by constructing it in the order specified above.
   - For values of `n` between 27 and 52, the constructed word is indeed the lexicographically smallest possible word.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n == 27` by setting the word to `'aay'`.
   - For other values, the construction logic ensures the smallest possible word.

### Verification with Provided Examples

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Input**: `24`
  - `24 - 53 = -29` (not applicable)
  - `24 - 28 = -4` (not applicable)
  - `24 - 3 = 21` -> `'aa' + 'v'` -> `'aav'`
  - Output: `aav` (correct)

- **Input**: `70`
  - `70 - 53 = 17` -> `'r' + 'zz'` -> `'rzz'`
  - Output: `rzz` (correct)

- **Input**: `3`
  - `3 - 3 = 0` -> `'aa' + 'a'` -> `'aaa'`
  - Output: `aaa` (correct)

- **Input**: `55`
  - `55 - 28 = 27` -> `'a' + 'z' + 'z'` -> `'czz'`
  - Output: `czz` (correct)

- **Input**: `48`
  - `48 - 53 = -5` (not applicable)
  - `48 - 28 = 20` -> `'a' + 'u' + 'z'` -> `'auz'`
  - Output: `auz` (correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly decodes the integer `n` into the lexicographically smallest three-letter word according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
