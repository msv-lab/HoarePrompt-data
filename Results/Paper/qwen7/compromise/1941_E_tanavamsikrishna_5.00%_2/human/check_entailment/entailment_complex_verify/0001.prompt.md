You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of river cells in a row, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.
def func_1(row, d):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: Output State: row is a list where each element at index i (0 <= i < d-1) is increased by 1 compared to its initial value, while the rest of the elements remain unchanged.

    #State: Output State: row is updated such that for each index \(i\) from \(d-1\) to \(len(row)-1\), the value of \(row[i]\) is incremented by 1 plus the minimum value of the previous \(d\) elements (including itself if \(i > 0\)). If \(i = 0\), then it is incremented by 1. All other elements in the list remain unchanged.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row' after it has been updated according to the specified rule. This means for each index \(i\) from \(d-1\) to \(len(row)-1\), the value of \(row[i]\) is incremented by 1 plus the minimum value of the previous \(d\) elements (including itself if \(i > 0\)). If \(i = 0\), then it is incremented by 1. All other elements in the list remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `row` and a positive integer `d`. It updates the list `row` by incrementing each element from index \(d-1\) to the last index by 1 plus the minimum value among the previous \(d\) elements (including itself if applicable). The function returns the last element of the updated list `row`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m, k, d) are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells. The first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.

    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of every consecutive k elements from the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \), along with a list of lists named `rows`. It calculates the sum of every consecutive \( k \) elements from a transformed list `costs`, which is derived from `rows` using `func_1`. Finally, it prints the minimum value from the `total_costs` list.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges over consecutive rows in a river grid.
   - Each row can have supports installed with a cost calculated using `func_1`.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates the cost of installing supports in a single row.
   - It initializes the first support cost to `row[0] + 1`.
   - For subsequent cells, it finds the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells and adds `1` to it.
   - This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It constructs the grid `rows` from the input.
   - It uses `func_1` to calculate the cost for each row and stores these costs in `costs`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the cost for a single row.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows and finds the minimum cost.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the implementation appears to be correct and follows the requirements.
