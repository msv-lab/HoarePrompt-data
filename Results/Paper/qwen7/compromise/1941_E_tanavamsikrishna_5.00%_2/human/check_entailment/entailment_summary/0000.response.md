### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the minimum cost of building \( k \) bridges over consecutive rows of a river grid. Each bridge must have supports installed such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most \( d \). The cost of installing a support in a cell is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function processes a single row of the river grid.
   - It ensures that the first and last cells always have supports.
   - For each cell from \( d-1 \) to the end, it sets the cost to \( 1 + \) the minimum cost of the previous \( d \) cells plus 1.
   - This ensures that the distance condition between supports is met.
   - The function returns the total cost for the row.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input parameters \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \).
   - It reads the river grid into a list of lists called `rows`.
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to get a list of costs for each row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of \( k \) consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

4. **Execution Summary Analysis**:
   - The execution summary for `func_1` correctly describes how it processes a row to ensure the distance condition between supports is met and calculates the total cost.
   - The execution summary for `func_2` correctly describes how it processes the entire grid to find the minimum cost for \( k \) consecutive rows.

5. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly applies `func_1` to each row and then finds the minimum cost for \( k \) consecutive rows.
   - Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program should work as intended.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
