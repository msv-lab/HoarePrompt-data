Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It initializes the cost for the first `d-1` cells by adding 1 to their depths.
   - For the remaining cells, it calculates the cost by taking the minimum cost from the previous `d` cells and adding 1 to the current cell's depth.
   - Finally, it returns the total cost for the row.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for the number of rows (`n`), columns (`m`), number of bridges (`k`), and maximum distance between supports (`d`).
   - It then reads the depths of each row into a list of lists (`rows`).
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to get the minimum cost of installing supports for each row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows by summing the costs of the rows in that set.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all sets of `k` consecutive rows.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement. It efficiently computes the minimum cost for building the bridges across the river. Therefore, the provided program is correct.
