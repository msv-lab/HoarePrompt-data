Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the integers inputted separated by spaces, rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells. The first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.**

Explanation: The code reads four integers from input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. It also mentions that `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` positive integers, representing the depths of the river cells, but the actual values of these lists are not initialized or modified by the given code. Therefore, the precondition regarding `rows` remains unchanged.
