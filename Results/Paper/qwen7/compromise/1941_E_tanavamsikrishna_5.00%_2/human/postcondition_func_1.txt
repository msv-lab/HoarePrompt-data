The function accepts four integer parameters \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \), along with a list of lists named `rows`. It calculates the sum of every consecutive \( k \) elements from a transformed list `costs`, which is derived from `rows` using `func_1`. Finally, it prints the minimum value from the `total_costs` list.
