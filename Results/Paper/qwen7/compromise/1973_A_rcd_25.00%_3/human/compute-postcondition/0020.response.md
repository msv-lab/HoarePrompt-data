Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`. `cur` is equal to `low`, and `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since there was no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the only effect of the `break` statement is to indicate that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. All the initial conditions and variable assignments remain unchanged.
