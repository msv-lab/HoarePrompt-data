Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `high` must be greater than `cur + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the loop or if statement it is inside. Since no new assignments or changes to the variables are made, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and the conditions remain the same as the initial state.
