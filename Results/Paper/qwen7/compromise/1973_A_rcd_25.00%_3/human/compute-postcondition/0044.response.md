Output State: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. Additionally, it indicates that the program will proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
