Let's analyze the given loop and the conditions step by step:

### Given Loop
```python
while high >= cur:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `t` is `k-2`
- `p1` is an input integer
- `p2` is an input integer
- `p3` is an input integer
- `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
- The loop breaks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`; otherwise, `cur` is increased by 1 and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `high >= cur`.
2. **Break Condition**: The loop breaks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
3. **Increment Condition**: If the loop does not break, `cur` is incremented by 1.

### Determining the Next State
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to maintain the condition `high >= cur`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `high` is still greater than or equal to `cur` at the start of the next iteration.

### Conclusion
- The only variable in the loop head is `high` and `cur`, but since the loop continues as long as `high >= cur`, we need to ensure that this condition holds true.
- Since `cur` is incremented by 1 if the loop does not break, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1` to ensure the loop can continue.

### Updated State
- `t` is `k-2`
- `p1` is an input integer
- `p2` is an input integer
- `p3` is an input integer
- `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
- `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`**
