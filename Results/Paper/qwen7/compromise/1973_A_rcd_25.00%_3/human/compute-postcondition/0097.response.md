Given the initial state:
- `t` is `k-2`
- `p1` is an input integer
- `p2` is an input integer
- `p3` is an input integer
- `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
- `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(p1 - cur + p3)`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are explicitly defined as input integers.
- `low` is defined as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, but this does not affect the value of `p1 - cur + p3`.
- `high` is defined as being greater than or equal to `cur + 1`, but again, this does not directly influence the value of `p1 - cur + p3`.

The expression `p1 - cur + p3` involves `p1`, `p3`, and `cur`. Since `cur` is not defined in the initial state, it must be an unknown variable. Therefore, the expression `p1 - cur + p3` will be left in its symbolic form because `cur` is not specified.

Output: **p1 - cur + p3**
