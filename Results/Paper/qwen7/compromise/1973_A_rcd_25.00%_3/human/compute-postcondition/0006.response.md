Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no specific changes are made to the variables `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` within the context of the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged. The only effect of the `continue` statement is to continue the loop, which is already implied by the initial postcondition.
