Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
        cur = low
        while high >= cur:
            if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                print(p1 - cur + p3)
                break
            else:
                cur += 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged, and after all iterations of the loop, `cur` will be either `high` or the value that makes `p1 - cur` less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, whichever comes last during the loop's execution. The loop will print either `p1 - cur + p3` if the condition is met before the loop ends, or it will print `p3` if no such `cur` is found.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `high` if `p3 < p1 + p2`; otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration of the loop if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `high`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
