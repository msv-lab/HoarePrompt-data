The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The states of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` are still valid as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `k-2`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `high` if `p3 < p1 + p2`, otherwise `cur` remains as `high`.**
