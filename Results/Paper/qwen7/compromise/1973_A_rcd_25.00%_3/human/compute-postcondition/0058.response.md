Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `high` and `cur`.

3. **Analyze the current state**: 
   - `t` is `k-1`.
   - `p1` is an input integer.
   - `p2` is an input integer.
   - `p3` is an input integer.
   - `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - The loop breaks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.
   - Since `high` is already defined as `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, it doesn't need adjustment.
   - `cur` needs to be such that `high >= cur` holds true for the next iteration.

5. **Consider the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is met, the loop breaks. Therefore, `cur` must be incremented by 1 in each iteration unless the loop breaks.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains `k-1`.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged.
   - `low` remains `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `high` remains `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `cur` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state for the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is `k-1`, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `cur` is `cur + 1`**.
