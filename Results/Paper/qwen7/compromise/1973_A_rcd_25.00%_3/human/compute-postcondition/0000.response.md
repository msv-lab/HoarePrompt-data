Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, the updated state of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. All other variables (`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
