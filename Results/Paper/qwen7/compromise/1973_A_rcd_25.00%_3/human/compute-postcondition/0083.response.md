Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `t` is `k-2`
   - `p1` is an input integer
   - `p2` is an input integer
   - `p3` is an input integer
   - `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
   - `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`
   - `cur` is `low`

2. **Key Information:**
   - The current value of `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - Since `cur` is `low`, we need to determine the value of `low`.

3. **Determine `low`:**
   - `low` is defined as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - This means `low` will be the smaller of the two values `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

4. **Evaluate the Condition:**
   - The condition `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)` simplifies to `p1 - low` being less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - low)`.
   - Substituting `cur` with `low`, this becomes `p1 - (p3 - p1) <= p2 - (p3 - (p3 - p1))`.
   - Simplifying further, we get `2*p1 - p3 <= p2 - p1 + p3`.
   - Rearranging terms, we get `3*p1 - 2*p3 <= p2`.

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(p1 - cur + p3)`.
   - Since `cur` is `low`, this becomes `print(p1 - (p3 - p1) + p3)`.
   - Simplifying, this is `print(2*p1)`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The value printed will be `2 * p1`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **2 * p1**
