Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`, `cur` is increased by 1.**

This means that the variable `cur` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables retain their original conditions and relationships as described in the initial state.
