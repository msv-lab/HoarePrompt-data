Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is `k-1`
- `p1` is an input integer
- `p2` is an input integer
- `p3` is an input integer
- The program continues with the next iteration of the loop if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.

The `print(p1 + p2)` statement will print the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

Since `p1` and `p2` are explicitly defined as input integers, we can directly use their values in the output.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 and p2 are input integers)**
