Let's analyze the given problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `high >= cur`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even.
   - `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`.
   - `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`.
   - `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.
   - If `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `high >= cur` depends on `high` and `cur`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `high` must still be greater than or equal to `cur` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `cur` is incremented by 1 inside the loop, for the loop to continue, `high` must be greater than `cur` at the start of the next iteration. This means `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `high` to ensure it is greater than `cur + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `high` must be greater than `cur + 1`**.
