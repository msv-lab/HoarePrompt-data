Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \). It checks if the sum of these integers is even. If not, it prints -1 and moves to the next test case. If the sum is even and \( p_3 \) is greater than or equal to \( p_1 + p_2 \), it prints \( p_1 + p_2 \). Otherwise, it calculates two values, `low` and `high`, based on the differences between \( p_3 \) and \( p_1 \) and \( p_3 \) and \( p_2 \). It then iteratively adjusts a variable `cur` within the range defined by `low` and `high` until it finds a value that satisfies a specific condition, printing the result accordingly. After processing all test cases, it outputs the last computed value.**
