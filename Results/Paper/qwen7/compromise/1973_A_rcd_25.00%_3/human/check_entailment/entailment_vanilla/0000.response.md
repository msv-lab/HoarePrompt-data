Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. This is because each game contributes either 2 points (to one player) or 2 points (1 to each player in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because an odd total cannot be achieved through any combination of wins and draws.

3. **Handling Invalid Scores:**
   - The program checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2`. This condition is not strictly necessary for the logic but might handle some edge cases where the scores are invalid in a specific context.

4. **Finding Maximum Draws:**
   - The program calculates the lower bound (`low`) and upper bound (`high`) for the number of draws.
   - It initializes `cur` to `low` and iterates while `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current number of draws (`cur`) is feasible by comparing the adjusted scores of `p1` and `p2`.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no valid number of draws is found within the bounds, it prints `p3`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it should ensure that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.
   - The condition `p3 >= p1 + p2` is not sufficient to validate the scores. It should be checked whether the scores can be achieved through a valid sequence of games.

2. **Logic for Finding Maximum Draws:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum number of draws is flawed. The program assumes that the scores can always be adjusted by a certain number of draws, which is not necessarily true.
   - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not correctly formulated to ensure the scores are achievable.

3. **Output for Valid Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. It prints `p1 + p2` or `p3` without ensuring these values are achievable through a valid sequence of games.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to handle all edge cases and does not accurately determine the maximum number of draws.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
