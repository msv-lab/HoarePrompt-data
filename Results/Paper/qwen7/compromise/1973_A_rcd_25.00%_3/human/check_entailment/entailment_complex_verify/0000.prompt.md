You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.

    t = int(input())

        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:

        else:
            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `p1` is an input integer, `p2` is an input integer, `p3` is an input integer, `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `cur` is `high`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \). It checks if the sum of these integers is even. If not, it prints -1 and moves to the next test case. If the sum is even and \( p_3 \) is greater than or equal to \( p_1 + p_2 \), it prints \( p_1 + p_2 \). Otherwise, it calculates two values, `low` and `high`, based on the differences between \( p_3 \) and \( p_1 \) and \( p_3 \) and \( p_2 \). It then iteratively adjusts a variable `cur` within the range defined by `low` and `high` until it finds a value that satisfies a specific condition, printing the result accordingly. After processing all test cases, it outputs the last computed value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for all potential cases. Specifically, consider the following input:

- Input: `1 1 10`

According to the problem description, the maximum number of draws for this scenario is 2. However, the program outputs 2, which seems correct at first glance. But let's analyze further:

1. For `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 10`, the total points are 12. This means there must be a combination of wins and draws that sum up to these points.
2. The only way to achieve `p3 = 10` with the minimum number of games is through a combination of wins and draws. Since `p1` and `p2` are both 1, they must have drawn against each other and won against `p3`. This would mean:
   - One draw between `p1` and `p2`.
   - Five wins for `p3` (since `p3` needs 10 points and can only win by 2 points per game).

However, the program does not account for the possibility of multiple draws among the players. To maximize the number of draws, we need to consider scenarios where more than one game ends in a draw. 

For instance, if `p1` and `p2` each draw with `p3` once, and then `p3` wins the remaining games, the maximum number of draws would be 2 (one between `p1` and `p3`, and one between `p2` and `p3`).

The current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
