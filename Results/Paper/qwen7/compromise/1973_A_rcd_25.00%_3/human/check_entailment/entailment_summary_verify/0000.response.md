### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem statement carefully.

#### Problem Statement Recap
- Three friends play chess games.
- Each game results in either a win (2 points), a loss (0 points), or a draw (1 point for each player).
- We need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).

#### Function Summary Recap
- The function processes test cases, checking if the sum of the scores is even.
- If the sum is odd, it prints -1.
- If the sum is even and \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \), it prints \( p_1 + p_2 \).
- Otherwise, it calculates `low` and `high` based on the differences between \( p_3 \) and \( p_1 \) and \( p_3 \) and \( p_2 \).
- It iteratively adjusts `cur` within the range defined by `low` and `high` until it finds a value that satisfies a specific condition, printing the result accordingly.

#### Analysis of the Given Example

Consider the input: `1 1 10`

- Total points: \( 1 + 1 + 10 = 12 \) (even, so proceed).
- \( p_3 = 10 \) and \( p_1 + p_2 = 2 \), so \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \) is true.
- The program should print \( p_1 + p_2 = 2 \).

However, the correct approach to maximize the number of draws involves considering multiple scenarios:
- If \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) each draw with \( p_3 \) once, and \( p_3 \) wins the remaining games, the maximum number of draws is 2 (one between \( p_1 \) and \( p_3 \), and one between \( p_2 \) and \( p_3 \)).

The current implementation does not account for such scenarios. Instead, it directly prints \( p_1 + p_2 \), which is not always the maximum number of draws.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Ensure the sum of scores is even.
2. Check if \( p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2 \).
3. Calculate the maximum number of draws by considering all possible combinations of wins and draws.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:
- Calculate the total points needed for \( p_3 \) to reach its score.
- Determine the maximum number of draws by considering the differences and ensuring the constraints are met.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the original program does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple draws can maximize the number of draws. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
