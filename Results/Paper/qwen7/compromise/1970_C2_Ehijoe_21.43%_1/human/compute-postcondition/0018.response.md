Based on the initial state provided:

- `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, but the specific details of `func_1` are not given, so we cannot determine the exact content of `moves`.
- `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes, but the exact contents are not specified.
- `empty` is `False`, meaning it is not an empty value.
- `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5`.
- `t` is `1`.
- `edges` is an empty list.
- `start` is an input integer such that `1 ≤ start ≤ n`.
- `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list.
- All moves in `moves` are even numbers.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Hermione'`.

Output: **'Hermione'**
