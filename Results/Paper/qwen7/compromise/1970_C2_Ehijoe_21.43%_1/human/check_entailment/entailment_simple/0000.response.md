Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the shortest path distances from the `start` node to all other nodes in the tree while respecting the parent node restriction.
   - It correctly handles the base case when the node has only one neighbor (itself) and returns `[0]`.
   - For each neighbor of the current node, it recursively calculates the distances and extends the list of distances with the new values incremented by 1 (indicating the distance from the current node).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function constructs the tree from the input and then calls `func_1` to get the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - It then checks if any of these distances are odd. If so, it prints "Ron", indicating Ron wins because he can force a win by making a move that results in an odd distance. If all distances are even, it prints "Hermione", indicating Hermione wins because she can force a win by making a move that results in an even distance.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - The game involves alternating moves between Ron and Hermione. The winner is determined by whether the distance from the starting node to the next node (after a move) is odd or even.
   - If there's at least one odd distance, Ron can always make a move that results in an odd distance, forcing Hermione into a position where she cannot make a move that results in an odd distance, thus losing.
   - Conversely, if all distances are even, Hermione can always make a move that results in an even distance, forcing Ron into a position where he cannot make a move that results in an odd distance, thus losing.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the input and edge cases appropriately, ensuring that the tree is constructed correctly and the distances are calculated as required.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.

Correctness: **True**
