### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game played on a tree structure where players take turns moving a stone from one node to an adjacent inactive node. The player who cannot make a move loses. The goal is to determine the winner for each round based on the optimal play strategy.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function computes the shortest path distances from a given starting node to all other nodes in the tree. Specifically, it checks if the starting node has only one neighbor (itself), in which case it returns `[0]`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the distances for all other nodes and returns these distances.
   - **`func_2`**: This function processes the input, constructs the tree, identifies all leaf nodes, and then calls `func_1` to get the sequence of moves starting from the specified node. It then checks if any of these moves have an odd length and determines the winner based on this condition.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The game's outcome depends on the parity of the shortest paths from the starting node to other nodes. If there is at least one path with an odd length, Ron wins because he can force Hermione into a position where she cannot make a move.
   - The function correctly identifies leaf nodes and uses them to determine the initial moves.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the move lengths is sound and aligns with the game rules.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the starting node is a leaf node correctly, as it would return `[0]` from `func_1`.
   - The function correctly processes the input and outputs the expected result based on the optimal play strategy.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of each round based on the game rules and the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the program is correct.
