Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic for determining the winner of each round. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes but does not account for the optimal strategy of the game. The program incorrectly assumes that if any distance is odd, Ron wins, which is not necessarily true based on the game rules.

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to implement a strategy that considers the parity of the distances and the structure of the tree. The current implementation does not handle the alternating moves between Ron and Hermione and does not consider the optimal play for both players.

A correct solution would involve analyzing the tree structure and determining the winning strategy based on the distances and the parity of the moves. The provided code does not achieve this.
