The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `nodes`, an integer `start`, and an optional integer `parent`. It returns either a list containing the integer 0 or a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the shortest path distance from the `start` node to another node in the graph and the corresponding node itself. The `parent` parameter remains unchanged (None). If the node has only one neighbor which is the `parent`, it returns a list containing 0. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the shortest path distances for all other nodes and returns these distances as a list of tuples.
