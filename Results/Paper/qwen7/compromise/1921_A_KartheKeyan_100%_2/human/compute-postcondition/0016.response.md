Output State: **`coord` is a list of four tuples sorted in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple, `i` is 5, `p1` is the squared distance between the second and first tuple in `coord`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second tuples in the list `coord` and assigns it to the variable `p1`. The calculation is based on the difference in the first elements and the second elements of these tuples. The values of `coord` and `i` remain unchanged.
