Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is at least 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]), `res` is math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])**.

Explanation: The code `n -= 1` decrements the value of `n` by 1. Since `n` was initially at least 3, after executing the code, `n` will be at least 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
