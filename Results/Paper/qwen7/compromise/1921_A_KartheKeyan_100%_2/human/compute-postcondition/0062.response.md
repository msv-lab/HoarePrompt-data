Output State: `i` is 12, `n` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]), `res` is math.sqrt(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` will be decremented to 0 since it starts as an input integer and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `i` will be 12 because it increments by 4 in each iteration (as there are 4 iterations per loop) and the loop runs 3 times, so \(3 \times 4 = 12\). The value of `x` and `y` remains as input integers from the last iteration, and `coord` contains the coordinates entered in the last iteration. The values of `p2` and `res` are calculated based on the last set of coordinates entered.
