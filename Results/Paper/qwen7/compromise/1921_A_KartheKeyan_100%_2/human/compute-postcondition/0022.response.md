Output State: **`i` is 4, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is the squared distance between the third and second tuple in `coord`, `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, and `n` must be non-zero.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `coord`. This means that the variable `coord` now contains an empty list. All other variables (`i`, `p2`, `res`, and `n`) retain their previous states as described in the initial state. Since `coord` is now an empty list, the calculation for `p2` cannot be performed, but the condition for `p2` remains the same. The value of `res` also depends on `p1` and `p2`, which haven't been defined yet, so the state for `res` remains as given. The condition that `n` must be non-zero is still valid.
