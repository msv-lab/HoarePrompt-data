Output State: **`coord` is now a list containing a tuple (`x`, `y`), where `x` and `y` are integers from the input split, `i` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The list `coord` is updated to contain a tuple `(x, y)`. The variable `i` remains unchanged with its value as 3.
