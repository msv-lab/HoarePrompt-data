Output State: **`x` is an integer from the input split, `y` is an integer from the input split**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged, but now `x` and `y` hold the integer values from the input.
