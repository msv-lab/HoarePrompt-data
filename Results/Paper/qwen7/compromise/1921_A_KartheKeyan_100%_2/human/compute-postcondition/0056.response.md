Output State: **`i` is 8, `n` is at least 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is `x - coord[2][0]`, `res` is 0, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the distance squared between the first two points in the sorted `coord` list. Since `coord` is sorted based on the first element of each tuple, `coord[0]` and `coord[1]` represent the first and second points respectively. The value of `p1` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of these two points. The other variables remain unchanged.
