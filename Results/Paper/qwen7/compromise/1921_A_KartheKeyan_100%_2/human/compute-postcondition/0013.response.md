Output State: **`coord` is now a list containing three tuples: the first one is (x, y) which are integers from the input split, the second one is also (x, y), and the third one is (x, y); `i` is 4**.

This means that the list `coord` originally contained two tuples, each being `(x, y)`. After executing the line `coord.append((x, y))`, another tuple `(x, y)` has been added to the list, making it contain three such tuples. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 4.
