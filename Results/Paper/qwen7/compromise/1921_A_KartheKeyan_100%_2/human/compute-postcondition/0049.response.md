Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is at least 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing two tuples [(x, y), (x, y)], `p2` is `x - coord[2][0]`, `res` is 0**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains one tuple `(x, y)`. After appending, `coord` now contains two identical tuples `(x, y)`. The values of `i`, `n`, `p2`, and `res` remain unchanged.
