Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`**.

The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are input integers, the list `coord` now contains exactly one tuple with these values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
