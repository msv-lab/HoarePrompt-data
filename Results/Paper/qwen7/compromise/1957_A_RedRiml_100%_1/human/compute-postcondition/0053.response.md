Output State: **`shapes` is increased by the sum of `d[j] // 3` for every `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers using the `map` function. This list is assigned to the variable `palka`. The other variables (`shapes`, `w`, `ln`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
