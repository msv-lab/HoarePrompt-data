Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `i` is the third element in the list `palka`; `pl` is a list containing the third element of `palka`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is the third element in the list `palka`) to the list `pl`. The initial conditions of `palka` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `palka` remains a list of integers with at least one element, and `i` is still the third element in the list `palka`. Additionally, `pl` now contains the third element of `palka`.
