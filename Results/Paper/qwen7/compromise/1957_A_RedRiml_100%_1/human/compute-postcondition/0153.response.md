Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers. It first checks if the integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) is provided, then for each test case, it checks if the integer n (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) is provided along with a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). The function does not return any specific value but rather processes the provided data according to the given constraints.**
