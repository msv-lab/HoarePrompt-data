Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers, `pl` is a list containing at least one element `i`, `d` is a dictionary where for each key `i` not in `pl` before the if statement, `d[i]` is incremented by 1, and for keys already in `pl`, `d[i]` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers with `i` being the second element, `pl` is a list containing at least one element `i` with `i` appended, `d` is a dictionary where for each key `i` not in `pl` before the if statement, `d[i]` is incremented by 1, and for keys already in `pl`, `d[i]` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers with `i` being the third element, `pl` is a list containing at least one element `i` with `i` appended, `d[i]` is incremented by 1 for each key `i` not in `pl` before the if statement, and for keys already in `pl`, `d[i]` remains 1, and `pl` now contains `i` as its last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
