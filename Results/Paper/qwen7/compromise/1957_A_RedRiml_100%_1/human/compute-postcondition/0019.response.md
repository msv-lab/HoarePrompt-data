Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers with `i` being the second element, `pl` is a list containing at least one element `i`, `d` is a dictionary where for each key `i` not in `pl` before the if statement, `d[i]` is now 1, and for keys already in `pl`, `d[i]` remains 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the dictionary `d` at key `i` to 1. This updates the dictionary `d` such that for keys not previously in `pl`, their value in `d` is set to 1, and for keys already present in `pl`, their value remains 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
