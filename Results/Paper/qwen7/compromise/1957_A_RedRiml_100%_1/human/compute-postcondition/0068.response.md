Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in palka`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that if `i` is not in `pl`, and `d[i]` was `None`, then `d[i]` is set to `1`. If `d[i]` was not `None`, then `d[i]` is incremented by `1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `d` is a dictionary.
   - If `i` is not in `pl`, and `d[i]` was `None`, then `d[i]` is set to `1`.
   - If `d[i]` was not `None`, then `d[i]` is incremented by `1`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `palka`, the variable `i` will be incremented or modified in some way for the next iteration.
   - The dictionary `d` might have been updated based on the value of `i`.

Given the loop head `for i in palka`, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `palka`. However, since `palka` is a collection and not a single variable, we focus on `i`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `palka`.
   - The dictionary `d` might have been updated, but the exact state of `d` depends on the value of `i` and its previous state.

Since we don't have the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, we assume it is the next element in `palka`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`d` is a dictionary, `i` is the next element in `palka`**.
