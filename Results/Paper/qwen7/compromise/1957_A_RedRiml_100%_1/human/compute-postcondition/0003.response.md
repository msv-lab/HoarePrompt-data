Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `palka`. The variables `t`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged from their initial state.
