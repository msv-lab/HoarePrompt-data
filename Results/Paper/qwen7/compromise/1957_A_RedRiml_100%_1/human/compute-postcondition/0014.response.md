Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers, `pl` is a list with at least one element (since it was initially empty), `d` is a dictionary where for each key `i` not in `pl`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1, and for keys already in `pl`, `d[i]` remains 1.
