Output State: **`d` is a dictionary, `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` contains the element `i`, if `d[i]` was `None`, then `d[i]` is now `1`, otherwise `d[i]` is incremented by `1`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. This means that `i` is now an element of `pl`. The initial conditions state that `d` is a dictionary, `i` is not in `pl`, and if `d[i]` is `None`, then `d[i]` is set to `1`. Otherwise, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by `1`. Since `i` is appended to `pl`, the condition that `i` is not in `pl` no longer holds true. However, the values of `d` and the initial conditions regarding `d[i]` remain as they were before the append operation.
