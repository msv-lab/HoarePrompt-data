Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the second element in the list `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` updates the dictionary `d` by setting the key `i` (which is the second element in the list `palka`) to the value 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
