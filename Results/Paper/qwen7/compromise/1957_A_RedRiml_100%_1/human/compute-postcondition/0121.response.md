Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the second element in the list `palka`, and `d[i]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1, where `i` is the second element in the list `palka`. The other variables and the structure of the list `palka` remain unchanged.
