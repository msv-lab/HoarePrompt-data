Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `j`, which is iterating over the list `pl`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `pl`. The variable `j` will take on each element of `pl` one by one.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `pl`, `pl` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `j` will take on the value of each element in `pl` during each iteration, but its initial state before the loop doesn't matter since it gets reassigned in each iteration.

4. **Consider the other given states**:
   - The dictionary `d` will contain counts of each integer in `palka` after the loop completes.
   - The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared after the loop completes.
   - The variable `w` remains greater than 0 after the loop completes.
   - The variable `shapes` is 0 and does not affect the loop's execution.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of the list `pl`. Specifically, `pl` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`pl` must have at least one element**
