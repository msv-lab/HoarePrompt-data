The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and always returns the string 'Alice'. This is determined by the following steps: first, it checks if the first element of `arr` is not 1, in which case it immediately returns 'Alice'. If the first element is 1, it proceeds to create a sorted list of unique elements from `arr`. It then iterates through this list to check if any two consecutive elements have a difference greater than 1. Regardless of the outcome of this check, the boolean variable `A` is toggled. Finally, based on the value of `A`, it returns 'Alice', ensuring that 'Alice' is returned in all cases.
