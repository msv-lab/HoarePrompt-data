Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`.
2. The function `func_1` always returns 'Alice' regardless of the input array `arr`, except when the first element of `arr` is not 1, in which case it immediately returns 'Alice'.
3. Given the problem statement, the game's outcome depends on the initial configuration of the piles. The function's logic does not accurately reflect the game's rules.
4. The function should be checking if the XOR of all pile sizes is non-zero, which determines the winner when both players play optimally. However, the current implementation does not do this.
5. Despite the incorrect logic, the provided code always returns 'Alice', which matches the output examples given in the problem statement. This is because the examples provided show 'Alice' winning in all cases, even though the actual game logic would determine the winner differently.

However, the function's logic is fundamentally flawed and does not implement the correct strategy for determining the winner based on the game's rules.

Correctness: **False**

The function does not correctly implement the game logic and always returns 'Alice', which is not the intended behavior according to the problem description.
