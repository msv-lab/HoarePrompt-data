You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')

            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:

            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20.
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')

            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')

            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')
        
    #State: Output State: The output will consist of multiple sections, each corresponding to the value of `n` provided for each iteration of the loop. For each `n`, the output will display a specific pattern printed according to the conditions given in the loop. If `n` is outside the specified range (1 to 4), it will print "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range") for that iteration. Each section of the output will be separated by blank lines.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not generate a 2n × 2n checkerboard for any n > 4. For example, if n = 5, the program will print "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range" in English), indicating that it cannot handle values outside the hardcoded conditions. This violates the problem description which requires the program to generate a checkerboard for any n within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).
