You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Program:
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. Based on the value of `n`, it prints a specific pattern consisting of `#` and `.` characters. If `n` is 1, it prints a 2x2 pattern; if `n` is 2, a 4x4 pattern; if `n` is 3, a 6x6 pattern; and if `n` is 4, an 8x8 pattern. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, it ends with no further output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a 2n x 2n checkerboard where each 2x2 block alternates between `#` and `.`, starting with `#` in the top-left corner.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`casos`) and processes each test case individually.

3. **Checkerboard Generation for Specific Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`: The program correctly prints `##` followed by `##`.
   - For `n = 2`: The program correctly prints the pattern `##..`, `##..`, `..##`, `..##`.
   - For `n = 3`: The program correctly prints the pattern `##..##`, `##..##`, `..##..`, `..##..`, `##..##`, `##..##`.
   - For `n = 4`: The program correctly prints the pattern `##..##..`, `##..##..`, `..##..##`, `..##..##`, `##..##..`, `##..##..`, `..##..##`, `..##..##`.

4. **Handling Larger Values of n**: The program incorrectly handles larger values of `n`. It prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range") instead of continuing to generate the checkerboard pattern.

5. **Checkerboard Pattern for General n**: The checkerboard pattern for any `n > 4` can be derived from the patterns for smaller `n` by repeating the 2x2 blocks. However, the current implementation does not handle this general case.

6. **Correct Implementation**: To correctly generate the checkerboard for any `n`, the program should use a nested loop structure to print the appropriate pattern for each 2x2 block, repeating the pattern as necessary.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle larger values of `n` beyond the hardcoded cases. It should use a more general approach to generate the checkerboard pattern for any `n`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
