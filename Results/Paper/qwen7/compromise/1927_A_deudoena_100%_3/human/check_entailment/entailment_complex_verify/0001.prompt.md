You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string consisting of n characters where each character is either 'W' (white) or 'B' (black), with at least one 'B' in the string.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `c` is the length of the string `s`, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `ma` is the length of the string `s` minus the position of the first 'B' from the end, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `c` is the length of the string `s`, `d` is the number of characters in `s`, `l` is an empty list.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the length of the string `s` minus the position of the first 'B' from the end, plus 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a binary string `s` (consisting of 'W' and 'B') and calculates a value based on the positions of the first 'B' from the start and the end of the string. Specifically, it returns the length of the string minus the position of the first 'B' from the end, plus 2. This value is returned without any parameters being passed directly to the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` but does not handle the input correctly within the loop.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the minimum length of a segment that needs to be painted white to make all cells white.
   - Variables `ma` and `mi` are initialized to 0.
   - `m` is read as the length of the strip, and `s` is read as the string representing the strip.
   - `c` and `d` are initialized to 0, and `l` is an empty list (though it is not used).
   - The first `for` loop iterates through the string `s` to find the first occurrence of 'B' and sets `mi` to the count `c` when it finds a 'B'.
   - The second `for` loop iterates through the reversed string `s` to find the last occurrence of 'B' and sets `ma` to the length of `s` minus the count `d` when it finds a 'B'.
   - Finally, the function returns `ma - mi + 2`.

### Issues with the Function:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The function calculates `ma` and `mi` incorrectly. `mi` should be the position of the first 'B', and `ma` should be the position of the last 'B'.
   - The formula `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect because it adds 2 instead of 1, and it doesn't account for the actual positions correctly.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the entire strip is already white, the function should return 0.
   - If the entire strip is black, the function should return the length of the strip.

### Correct Approach:
To find the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white:
- Find the first occurrence of 'B' (`mi`).
- Find the last occurrence of 'B' (`ma`).
- The minimum length required is `ma - mi + 1`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input().strip()
    mi = s.find('B')
    ma = s.rfind('B')
    if mi == -1 and ma == -1:  # If no 'B' is found
        return 0
    return ma - mi + 1

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the wrong calculation and handling of edge cases. The corrected approach ensures the correct minimum length is calculated.
