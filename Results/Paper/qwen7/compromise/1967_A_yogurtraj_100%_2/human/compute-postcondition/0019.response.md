Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, n - 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `k` is updated based on a condition involving `i` and `a[i]`
   - `r` is set to `a[i + 1]` if the condition is false
   - `y` is set to -1 while `rem` is 0 if the condition is true

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be 2
   - `n` must still be greater than 0

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
