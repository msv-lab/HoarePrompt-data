Output State: **`k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`.**

This means that the value of `k` has been updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its original value. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1, and the condition that `n` is greater than `i + 1` still holds true.
