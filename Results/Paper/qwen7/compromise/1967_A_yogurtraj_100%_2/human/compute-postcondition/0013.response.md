Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `y` is -1, `k` is 0, `r` is a[0], `rem` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, the variables remain unchanged. The preconditions and the values of the variables before the `break` statement are preserved.
