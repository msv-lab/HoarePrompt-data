Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])` if `i` was 1, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `rem` is `k % 1`, `r` is `a[2] + k // 1`, `y` is `n - 5`**

Explanation: The code updates `y` to `n - 1 - i`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `y = n - 1 - 0`, which further simplifies to `y = n - 1`. Since the initial state of `y` is given as `y` is `n - 4`, the new value of `y` is calculated as `n - 5`. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `rem`, `r`, `a[2]`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
