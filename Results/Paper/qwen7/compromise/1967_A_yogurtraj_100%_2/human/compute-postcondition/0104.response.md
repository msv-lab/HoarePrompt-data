Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 2`**.

Explanation: The initial value of `i` is 0, and the code `y = n - 1 - i` increments `i` by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the conditions and values of `a`, `r`, and `rem` also remain unchanged. The new value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.
