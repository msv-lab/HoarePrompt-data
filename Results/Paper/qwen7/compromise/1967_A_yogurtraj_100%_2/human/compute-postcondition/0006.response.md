Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the user input, `n` is the first integer in the sorted list, `k` is the second integer in the sorted list, `r` is equal to `a[0]` (which is `n`), `rem` is 0, `y` is 0.**

The code `y = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `y`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `a`, `n`, `k`, `r`, and `rem` remain unchanged.
