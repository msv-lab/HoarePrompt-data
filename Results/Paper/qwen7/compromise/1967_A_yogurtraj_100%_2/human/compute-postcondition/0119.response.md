Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is decreased by the value of `(1 + 1) * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is equal to `a[2]`**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`, which means `r` is now equal to `a[2]`. The value of `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, but since `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `k` being decreased by `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`. The values of `i` and `k` are updated accordingly, and `r` is set to `a[2]`.
