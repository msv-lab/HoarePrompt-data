Output State: **`ii` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to `a`. The values of `ii`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
