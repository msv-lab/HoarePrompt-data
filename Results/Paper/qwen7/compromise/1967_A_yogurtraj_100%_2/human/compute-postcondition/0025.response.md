Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by subtracting the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value. Given that `i` is initially 2, the term `(i + 1)` becomes 3. However, since `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` are not defined in the initial state, they remain as they are. The value of `n` being greater than 0 is still valid but no changes occur to it. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2.
