Postcondition: `k` is either reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` or remains unchanged, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is false, otherwise `r` is equal to `a[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than `i + 1`. If the condition is true, `y` is `n - 1 - i` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.
