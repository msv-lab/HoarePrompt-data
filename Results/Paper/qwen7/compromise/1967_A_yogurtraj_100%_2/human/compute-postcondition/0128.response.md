Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, `y` is `n - 4`, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` which is 1 * (a[1] - a[0])**.

Explanation: Since `i` is 0, the condition `if i was 1` is not met, so `k` remains unchanged as `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`. The code then subtracts `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from `k`, which simplifies to `1 * (a[1] - a[0])` because `i` is 0. All other variables (`rem`, `r`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
