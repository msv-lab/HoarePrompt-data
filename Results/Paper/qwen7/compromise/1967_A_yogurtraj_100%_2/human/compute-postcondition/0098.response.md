Output State: **`ii` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `rem` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`ii`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `r`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
