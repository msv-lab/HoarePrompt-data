Output State: **`a` is a list of integers split from the user input, `n` is the first integer in the list, `k` is the second integer in the list**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. Since `n` and `k` are defined as the first and second integers input by the user respectively, they remain unchanged and are now the first and second elements in the list `a`.
