Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is unchanged, `rem` is `k % 3`, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `y` is `n - 2 - i`**

Explanation: The code `y = n - 1 - i` assigns the value of `n - 1 - i` to the variable `y`. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `y` becomes `n - 1 - 2` which simplifies to `n - 3`. The values of `i`, `k`, `rem`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
