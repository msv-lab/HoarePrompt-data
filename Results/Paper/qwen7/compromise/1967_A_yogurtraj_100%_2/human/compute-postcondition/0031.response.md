Output State: **`i` is 3, `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`, `rem` is `k % 4`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, which is `k % 4` since `i` is 3. The value of `i` and `r` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `i` is 3, `r` is `a[3] + k // 4`, and `rem` is `k % 4`.
