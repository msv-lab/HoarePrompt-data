Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is 0, `rem` is 0, `r` is `a[2]`, `y` is `n - 5`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged.
