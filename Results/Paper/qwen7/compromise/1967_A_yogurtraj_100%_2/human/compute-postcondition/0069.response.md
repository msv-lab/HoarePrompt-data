Output State: **`k` is either reduced or unchanged, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `r` is equal to `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`**.

This means that the value of `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i`. All other variables retain their previous conditions and values.
