The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and then iterates through it to find the maximum value `r` that can be achieved by redistributing up to `k` units among the elements of `a`. Depending on the remaining value of `k` after redistribution, it calculates and prints the final result.
