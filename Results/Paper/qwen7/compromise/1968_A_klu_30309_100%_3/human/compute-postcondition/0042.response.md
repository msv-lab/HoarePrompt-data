Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `y` and the range it iterates over, which is `range(x - 1, 0, -1)`. This means `y` starts from `x - 1` and decreases by 1 until it reaches 0.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states:
   - `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-1`.
   - `y` is `x-1`.
   - `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.
   - `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.

3. **Check the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `y` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was `x-1`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `y` by 1 each iteration, `y` will now be `x-2`.
   - `gcd_val` remains unchanged because the GCD calculation does not depend on the value of `y` directly but rather on `x` and `x-1`.
   - `current_sum` and `max_sum` will remain the same unless the loop body modifies them, but based on the given information, they should not change.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `gcd_val` remains the same.
   - `y` is now `x-2`.
   - `current_sum` and `max_sum` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-1`, `y` is `x-2`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-1)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-1)`**.
