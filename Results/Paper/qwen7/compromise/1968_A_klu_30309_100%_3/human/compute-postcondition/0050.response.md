Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-2`.
   - `y` is `x-2`.
   - `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`.
   - `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`.
   - `best_y` is `x-2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `y` in the range from `x-1` down to `1` (inclusive).

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `y`.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each value of `y` in the specified range, the loop body is executed.
   - The loop will continue as long as `y` is greater than `0`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop starts with `y = x-2` and decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `y` will be `y - 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `y` is still within the valid range (i.e., `y > 0`).

Given the initial state and the loop condition, let's determine the new state at the start of the next iteration:

- `gcd_val` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `y` decreases by 1 from its current value `x-2`.
- `current_sum` and `max_sum` will be updated based on the loop body, but since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the loop, these remain unchanged.
- `best_y` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-2`, `y` is `x-3`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x-2)`, and `best_y` is `x-2`.**
