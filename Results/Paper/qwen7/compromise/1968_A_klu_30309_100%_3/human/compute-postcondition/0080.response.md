Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is defined as `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `y` and `x`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `x-1` down to `1`. This means that `y` starts at `x-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`.
   - `best_y` is `x - 2`.
   - `x` is a positive integer.
   - `y` is `x - 2`.
   - `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 2)`.
   - `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is exited.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `y` in reverse from `x-1` to `1`, the value of `y` will decrease by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `y` will be `x-3` in the next iteration.
   - `x` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Construct the New State**:
   - `max_sum` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `best_y` remains `x - 2`.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `y` becomes `x - 3`.
   - `gcd_val` remains the same since it is calculated once and does not change.
   - `current_sum` will be recalculated in the next iteration based on the new value of `y`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 2)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)**
