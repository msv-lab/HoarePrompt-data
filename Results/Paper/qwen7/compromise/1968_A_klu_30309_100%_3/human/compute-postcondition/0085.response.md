Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
