Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`.
   - `test_cases` must have at least one element.
   - `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`.
   - `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum > max_sum`.
   - `x` is at least 2.
   - `y` is \(x - 1\).
   - `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.
   - `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over `y` starting from `x - 1` down to 1.

3. **Loop Body**: 
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the loop head, we know it involves adjusting `y` and possibly other variables like `gcd_val` and `current_sum`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The loop variable `y` starts at `x - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be decreased by 1 from its current value.

5. **Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was \(x - 1\).

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `y` will be \(x - 2\).

7. **Other Variables**:
   - Since the loop body does not explicitly mention changing `x`, `gcd_val`, or `current_sum`, these values remain the same unless the loop body changes them.

8. **Final State**:
   - `y` will be \(x - 2\).
   - All other variables (`results`, `t`, `test_cases`, `max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `y` is \(x - 2\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and \(y = x - 2\), `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`.**
