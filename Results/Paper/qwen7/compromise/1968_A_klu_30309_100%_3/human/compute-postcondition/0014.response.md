Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `y` is \(x - 2\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and \(y = x - 2\), `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)\), `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y**.

In this step, the value of `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + y`. Since `y` is defined as `x - 2`, the updated `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
