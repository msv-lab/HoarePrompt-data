Output State: **`max_sum` is `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 2)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`**

Explanation: The code updates `max_sum` to the value of `current_sum`. Since `current_sum` was previously defined as `gcd_val + y`, and no other changes were made to `max_sum`, `max_sum` now holds the same value as `current_sum`. All other variables (`best_y`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
