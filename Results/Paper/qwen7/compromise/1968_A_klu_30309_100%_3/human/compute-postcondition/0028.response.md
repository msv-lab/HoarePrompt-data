Output State: **`results` is now a list containing the single element `best_y`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is the maximum value of `current_sum` obtained from the loop for each `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value when `max_sum` was updated, `x` is the last value of `x` processed in the loop, `y` is the last value of `y` processed in the loop, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(best_y)` appends the value of `best_y` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending `best_y`, `results` now contains a single element, which is `best_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
