Output State: `max_sum` is the maximum sum obtained from any `y` value during the loop, `best_y` is the `y` value that resulted in the highest `max_sum`, `x` is the last value of `x` processed in the loop, `y` is the last `y` value processed in the loop, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of the last `x` and `y` values, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `max_sum` will hold the highest sum ever calculated during the loop, `best_y` will be the `y` value that contributed to this highest sum, and `x` and `y` will be the last pair of values processed in the loop. The `gcd_val` will be the greatest common divisor of these last `x` and `y` values, and `current_sum` will be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y` for the final iteration.
