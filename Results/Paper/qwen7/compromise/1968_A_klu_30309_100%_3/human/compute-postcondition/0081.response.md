Output State: **`max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 2)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`, `gcd_val` is recalculated as `math.gcd(x, x - 3)**.

Explanation: The code updates `gcd_val` to be the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`. Since `y` is defined as `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is now `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
