Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` remains unchanged, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, `y` and `results` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `max_sum = 0` sets the variable `max_sum` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `max_sum`, which was defined as the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during the iterations. All other variables (`best_y`, `x`, `y`, and `results`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.
