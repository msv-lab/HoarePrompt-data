Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `y` and the expression `x - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `y` and `x`**:
   - The loop will iterate over values of `y` starting from `x - 1` down to 1 (since `y` is decremented by 1 each iteration).
   - For the loop to start, `x` must be at least 2 because the loop condition is `y` going from `x - 1` down to 1.

3. **Initial State of `results`, `t`, `test_cases`, `max_sum`, and `best_y`**:
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element.
   - `max_sum` is 0.
   - `best_y` is 1.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `x` and `y`, and the initial value of `x` is not specified, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 2.
   - The initial value of `y` will be `x - 1`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 2, and `y` will start from `x - 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `x` must be at least 2.
- `y` will start from `x - 1`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` must be at least 2, and `y` will start from `x - 1`**.
