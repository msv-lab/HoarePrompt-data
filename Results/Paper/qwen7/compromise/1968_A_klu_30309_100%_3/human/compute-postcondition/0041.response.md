Postcondition: `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-1`, `y` is `x-1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, and `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. There is no else part, so the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `current_sum > max_sum` is not met.
