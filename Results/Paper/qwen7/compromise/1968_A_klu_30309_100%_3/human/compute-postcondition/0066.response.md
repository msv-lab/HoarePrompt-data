Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 1`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 1)`, `current_sum` is `math.gcd(x, x - 1) + y**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `gcd_val + y` to `current_sum`. Given that `y` is `x - 1` and `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 1)`, which simplifies to `1` because the greatest common divisor of any number and its predecessor is always 1, `current_sum` becomes `1 + (x - 1)`, which simplifies to `x`. Therefore, `current_sum` is updated to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
