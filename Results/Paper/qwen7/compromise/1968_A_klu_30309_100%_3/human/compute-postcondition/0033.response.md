Output State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-1`, `y` is `x-1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the `math.gcd` function. Given that `y` is `x-1`, the GCD of `x` and `x-1` is 1 because `x` and `x-1` are consecutive integers and thus coprime. The value of `y` remains unchanged. Therefore, `gcd_val` is 1 and `y` is `x-1`.
