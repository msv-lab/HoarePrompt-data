Output State: **`res` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `i` is equal to the new length of `a`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is always zero, it is removed. The variable `i` is equal to the length of the updated list `a`, and `t` and `n` remain unchanged with their initial conditions.
