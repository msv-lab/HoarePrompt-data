Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `a and a[-1] == 0`.

2. **Current State:**
   - `res` is 0
   - `_` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `a` is an empty list

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   The variables in the loop head are `a` and `a[-1] == 0`.

4. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` must not be empty (`a` should have at least one element).
   - The last element of `a` must be 0 (`a[-1] == 0`).

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `a` is currently an empty list, it cannot satisfy the condition `a and a[-1] == 0`.
   - To make the loop execute again, `a` must have at least one element, and the last element of `a` must be 0.

6. **Final State:**
   - `res` remains 0 (unchanged)
   - `_` remains 0 (unchanged)
   - `n` remains an input integer (unchanged)
   - `a` must have at least one element, and the last element of `a` must be 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`res` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` must have at least one element and the last element of `a` must be 0**
