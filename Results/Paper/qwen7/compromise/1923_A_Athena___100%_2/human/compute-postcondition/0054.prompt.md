Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `res` is 0, `a` is either an empty list or a list where the first element is not 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to remove the first element of the list `a` as long as it is 0. After executing the loop as many times as necessary (until the first element is not 0 or the list is empty), the list `a` will either be empty or its first element will be a non-zero integer. The variable `res` remains unchanged at 0 throughout the loop's execution.
Code of the loop:
while a and a[-1] == 0:
    a.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is 0; `a` is a non-empty list and its last element is no longer 0
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `res` is 0; `a` is empty or its last element is no longer 0
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `res` is 0; `a` does not end with 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
