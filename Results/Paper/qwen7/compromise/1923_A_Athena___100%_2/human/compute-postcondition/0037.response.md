Output State: **`res` is a non-negative integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`res`, `_`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
