Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The solution removes leading and trailing zeros but does not account for the minimum number of operations needed to move chips to form a single block. Here's why the current solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations**: The code simply counts the number of zeros in the array after removing leading and trailing zeros. This does not reflect the actual minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.

2. **Missing Key Logic**: The solution lacks the logic to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to move each chip to the left until they are adjacent. Specifically, it should consider moving each chip to the nearest free cell to its left until no more moves can be made.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to iterate through the array and count the number of operations required to move each chip to the left until they are all adjacent. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        last_chip_position = -1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == 1:
                if last_chip_position != -1:
                    res += i - last_chip_position - 1
                last_chip_position = i
        
        print(res)
```

This corrected function correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.
