Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the values of `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_1()`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_1()` calls the function `func_1()`, which returns two values. These returned values are assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. Since the exact values returned by `func_1()` are not specified, we can only say that `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_1()`. The initial conditions that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n remain valid.
