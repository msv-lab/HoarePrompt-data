Output State: **`p[i]' is assigned the value of `ind` - 2**.

Explanation: The value of `ind` is decreased by 2, and then this new value is assigned back to `p[i]`. The initial assignment of `p[i]` being equal to `ind` remains true, but now `ind` has been updated to `ind - 2`. Therefore, `p[i]` is now equal to `ind - 2`.
