Output State: **`p[i]` is equal to `ind + 4`, `i` is equal to `ind + 8`, `ind` is equal to `ind + 4`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `p[i]` is equal to `ind`.
- `i` is equal to `ind + 8`.
- `ind` is equal to `ind + 4`.

After executing the line `p[i] = ind`, `p[i]` gets updated to the current value of `ind`, which is `ind + 4`. The other variables `i` and `ind` remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
