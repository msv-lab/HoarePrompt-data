Output State: **`p[i+2]` is `ind - 6`, `i` is `i + 4`, `n` is greater than `i + 4`, `ind` is `ind - 4`, and `p[i]` is `ind`.**

Explanation: The code `ind -= 2` decreases the value of `ind` by 2. Initially, `ind` was `ind - 2`, so after executing the code, `ind` becomes `ind - 4`. The other variables (`p[i+2]`, `i`, `n`, and `p[i]`) remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
