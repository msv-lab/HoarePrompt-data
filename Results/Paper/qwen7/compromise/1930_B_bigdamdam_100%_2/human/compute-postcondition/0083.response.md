Output State: `ind` is 2*n - 1, `i` is n, `p` is filled from index 0 to n-1 with values from `2*n - 1` down to `2*n - 1 - 2*n`, and `p[i]` is `2*n - 1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ind` will be `2*n - 1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The list `p` will be filled from index 0 to n-1 with values starting from `2*n - 1` and decreasing by 2 for each subsequent index, down to `2*n - 1 - 2*n`. Additionally, the value at index `i` (which is `n`) in the list `p` will be `2*n - 1`.
