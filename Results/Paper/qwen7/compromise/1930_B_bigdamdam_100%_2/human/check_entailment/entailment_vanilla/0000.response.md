Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses two loops to fill the list `p`:
     - The first loop fills even indices with decreasing values starting from `n` down to `1` (or `2` if `n` is odd).
     - The second loop fills odd indices with increasing values starting from `1` (if `n` is odd) or `2` (if `n` is even) up to `n`.

3. **Divisibility Check**:
   - The problem requires that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - The proposed construction method ensures that no such pair exists because:
     - Even indices are filled with decreasing values, so no even index value can divide another even index value.
     - Odd indices are filled with increasing values, so no odd index value can divide another odd index value.
     - Even and odd indices are separated, ensuring that no divisibility condition can be met between adjacent elements.

### Verification:

Let's verify the logic with a few examples:

- **Example 1**: `n = 4`
  - The constructed permutation would be `[4, 2, 1, 3]`.
  - No pair `(i, j)` exists such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
  
- **Example 2**: `n = 3`
  - The constructed permutation would be `[3, 1, 2]` or `[1, 3, 2]`.
  - Both permutations satisfy the condition since no pair `(i, j)` exists where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

### Conclusion:

The given program constructs a valid permutation according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
