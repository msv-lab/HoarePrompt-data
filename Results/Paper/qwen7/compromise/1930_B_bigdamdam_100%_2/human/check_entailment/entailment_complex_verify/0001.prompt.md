You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        
        p = [0] * n
        
        ind = n
        
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: Output State: `ind` is `2*n - 1`, `i` is `n`, and `p` is a list of length `n` where `p[i]` is `2*n - 1` for all `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ind` will be `2*n - 1`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The list `p` will be filled with the value `2*n - 1` for every index from `0` to `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)). For each test case, it creates a list \( p \) of length \( n \) and fills it with the value \( 2n - 1 \). After processing all test cases, it prints the list \( p \) for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the final state of the list \( p \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes a list `p` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses two loops to fill the list `p`:
     - The first loop fills even indices with decreasing values starting from `n` down to `1` (or `2` if `n` is odd).
     - The second loop fills odd indices with increasing values starting from `1` (if `n` is odd) or `2` (if `n` is even) up to `n`.

3. **Divisibility Check**:
   - The problem requires that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - The proposed construction method ensures that no such pair exists because:
     - Even indices are filled with decreasing values, so no even index value can divide another even index value.
     - Odd indices are filled with increasing values, so no odd index value can divide another odd index value.
     - Even and odd indices are separated, ensuring that no divisibility condition can be met between adjacent elements.

### Verification:

Let's verify the logic with a few examples:

- **Example 1**: `n = 4`
  - The constructed permutation would be `[4, 2, 1, 3]`.
  - No pair `(i, j)` exists such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
  
- **Example 2**: `n = 3`
  - The constructed permutation would be `[3, 1, 2]` or `[1, 3, 2]`.
  - Both permutations satisfy the condition since no pair `(i, j)` exists where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

### Conclusion:

The given program constructs a valid permutation according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
