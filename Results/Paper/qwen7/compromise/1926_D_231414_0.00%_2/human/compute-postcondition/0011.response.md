Output State: **`data` is a non-empty list containing at least one integer, `i` is the first element of the list `data`, `s` is the bitwise XOR of `i` and `check`, `dic[s]` is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the list `data` remains unchanged, the first element `i` of the list `data` remains the same, and the value of `s` (which is the bitwise XOR of `i` and `check`) also remains unchanged. However, the value of `dic[s]` is decremented by 1.
