Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder for the loop variable) and the variable `times`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `times` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the state of the variable `times`. The initial state of `times` is given as an input integer, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we can conclude that the only state that needs to be adjusted is `times`, ensuring it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`times` must be greater than 0**
