Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except `ans[i]` which is now `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` where `i` is `n - 5`, `i` is decreased by 1.**

The variable `i` is decremented by 1, but the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
