Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is calculated based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` starting from `i = n - 2` down to `i = 0`, `i` is now -1 (since it is decremented until it becomes less than 0).

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans[0]` will contain the final computed value, and all other elements in `ans` will also be updated according to the given formula. The variable `i` will be set to -1 because the loop continues to decrement `i` until it is no longer greater than or equal to 0.
