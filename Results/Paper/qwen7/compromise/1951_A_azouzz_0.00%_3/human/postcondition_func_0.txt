The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the string `s` and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on those conditions. The function does not modify any external variables and its return value is determined by the conditions evaluated during the processing of each test case.
