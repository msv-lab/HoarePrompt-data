The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three non-negative integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\) and moves to the next test case. Otherwise, it calculates and prints one of two possible values: either \(p_1 + p_2\) or \(p_1 - x + p_3\), depending on the relationship between \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
