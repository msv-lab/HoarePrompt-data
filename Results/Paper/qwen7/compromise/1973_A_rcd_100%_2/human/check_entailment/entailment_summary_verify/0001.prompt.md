You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three non-negative integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\) and moves to the next test case. Otherwise, it calculates and prints one of two possible values: either \(p_1 + p_2\) or \(p_1 - x + p_3\), depending on the relationship between \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
     - **Reasoning:** The total points must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points (1 to each in a draw).

3. **Checking Feasibility of Scores:**
   - The program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`.
     - **Reasoning:** This condition ensures that the highest score (`p3`) can be achieved without violating the rules. However, this alone does not guarantee the maximum number of draws.

4. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the above condition is not met, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws.
     - **Reasoning:** The loop iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` (representing the number of wins for the first and second player respectively), ensuring that the difference in points between the players is minimized, which helps in maximizing the number of draws.
     - **Condition:** The loop continues until `y < x`, and it checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y` to ensure the scores are feasible.
     - **Break Condition:** If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks the loop.
     - **Else Case:** If no valid combination is found, it prints `p3`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling Cases Where Scores Are Not Feasible:**
   - The current logic does not handle cases where the scores are not feasible but still need to be checked properly. For example, in the case `1 1 10`, the program incorrectly prints `10` instead of `-1`.

2. **Maximizing Draws:**
   - The approach to maximize draws needs more rigorous checking. The current logic might not always find the maximum number of draws correctly.

### Corrected Program:
To address these issues, we need to ensure that we correctly identify when the scores are not feasible and handle the maximization of draws more rigorously.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 > p1 + p2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        max_draws = 0
        for x in range(p1 + 1):
            for y in range(p2 + 1):
                if p1 - x == p2 - y and p1 - x + p3 - y <= total_points // 2:
                    max_draws = max(max_draws, p1 - x + p3 - y)
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
After analyzing and correcting the program, the corrected version should handle all edge cases and maximize the number of draws correctly. Therefore, the original program as presented has issues and needs correction.
