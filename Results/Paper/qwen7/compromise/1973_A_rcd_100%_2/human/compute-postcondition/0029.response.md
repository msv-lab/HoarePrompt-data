`x` is incremented by 1. Since `x` was either 0 or 1, after the increment, `x` will be 1 or 2. However, since `x` can only be 0 or 1 based on the initial state, it will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is 1, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`, `x` is 1, and `y` must be `p3`.**
