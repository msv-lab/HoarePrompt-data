Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 0, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers entered by the user, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd with `p3` being less than `p1 + p2`, and `x` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `y -= 1` decrements the value of `y` by 1. Since the initial value of `_` is 1, after executing `y -= 1`, the value of `_` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
