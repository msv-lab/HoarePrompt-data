Output State: **`p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` must be an odd number and at least 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, `y` is now `y - 1`, and `y + 1` must be greater than or equal to `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `y -= 1` decrements the value of `y` by 1. Since `y` was previously `y - 1`, it is now `y - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
