Output State: **`p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program will exit the most internal loop or conditional block it is currently in. All other variables retain their initial values from the precondition.
