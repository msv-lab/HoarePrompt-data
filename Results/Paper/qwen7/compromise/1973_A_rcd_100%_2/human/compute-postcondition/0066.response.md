`x` is incremented by 1. Initially, `x` is either 0 or 2. After incrementing, `x` will be 1 or 3, respectively. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` must be an odd number and at least 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 2, `x` is 1 or 3, `y` is either `p3` or `p3 - 1`, and `y` is greater than or equal to 2.**
