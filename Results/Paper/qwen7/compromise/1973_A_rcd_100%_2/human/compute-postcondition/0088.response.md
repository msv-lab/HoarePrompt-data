Postcondition: `p1` is an integer entered by the user, `p2` is an integer entered by the user, `p3` is an integer entered by the user, the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `_` is 1, `x` is 0, `y` is `p3`. The current value of `p1 - x` is less than or equal to the current value of `p2 - y`.
