Output State: **`count` is the original value of `count` plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

Explanation:
- The code increments the value of `residue_map[current_key]` by 1. Since `current_key` is defined as `(num % x, num % y)`, this means that the count of occurrences of this key in the `residue_map` is now one more than before.
- All other variables (`count`, `r_x`, `r_y`, `current_key`, `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
