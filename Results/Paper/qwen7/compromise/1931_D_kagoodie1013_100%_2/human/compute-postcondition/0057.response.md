Output State: **`count` is 0 plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is -num % x, `r_y` is num % y, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y), `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` having a value of 1 more than its previous value, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

Explanation:
- The line `residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1` increments the count of the current key in the `residue_map` dictionary. If the key does not exist, it initializes it to 1.
- All other variables (`count`, `r_x`, `r_y`, `current_key`, `num`, `x`, `y`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
