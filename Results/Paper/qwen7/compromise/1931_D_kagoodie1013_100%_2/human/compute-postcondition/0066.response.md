Output State: **`count` is the original value of `count` plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `r_y` is updated to be `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code updates `r_y` to be `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous values. The value of `r_y` is now specifically defined as `num % y`.
