Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(r_x, r_y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `r_x` is updated to `-num % x`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r_x` to `-num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `count` is still increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `r_x` is now `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(r_x, r_y)`, `residue_map[current_key]` is `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`, and `num` is the next element in `arr`.
