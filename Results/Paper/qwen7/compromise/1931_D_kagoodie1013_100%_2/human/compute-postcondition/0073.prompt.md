Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n); `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    residue_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        r_x = -num % x
        r_y = num % y
        count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
        current_key = num % x, num % y
        residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` contains the value of `count`, `count` is the sum of all values in `residue_map.values()`, `r_x` and `r_y` are calculated based on the last `num` processed, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)` corresponding to the last `num`, and `residue_map` contains counts of all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs encountered during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` contains the final value of `count`, `r_x` and `r_y` are the last calculated values of `-num % x` and `num % y` respectively, `current_key` is the last calculated key `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` contains all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs from `arr` as keys and their respective counts as values, `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are empty or irrelevant to the final state since the loop has completed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list containing the sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` found in `arr` according to the given conditions; `count` is the total sum of these occurrences; `r_x` and `r_y` reflect the last computed values from the loop; `current_key` represents the last key computed; `residue_map` is a dictionary containing all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs encountered during the loop, along with their frequencies; `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the last values from the final tuple in `test_cases`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
