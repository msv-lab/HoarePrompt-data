Output State: **`residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), results is an empty list, count is 0.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `residue_map`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
