Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if there are more test cases in `test_cases`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` contains the final value of `count`.
   - `r_x` and `r_y` are the last calculated values of `-num % x` and `num % y` respectively.
   - `current_key` is the last calculated key `(num % x, num % y)`.
   - `residue_map` contains all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs from `arr` as keys and their respective counts as values.
   - `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are empty or irrelevant to the final state since the loop has completed.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

Since the loop is iterating over `test_cases`, and assuming `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, the next iteration will use the next tuple in the list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
- `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
- `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.

State: **`results` contains the final value of `count`, `r_x` and `r_y` are the last calculated values of `-num % x` and `num % y` respectively, `current_key` is the last calculated key `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` contains all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs from `arr` as keys and their respective counts as values, `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**
