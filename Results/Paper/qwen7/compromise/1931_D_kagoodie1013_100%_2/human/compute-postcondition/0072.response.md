Output State: **`results` is a list containing the sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` found in `arr` according to the given conditions; `count` is the total sum of these occurrences; `r_x` and `r_y` reflect the last computed values from the loop; `current_key` represents the last key computed; `residue_map` is a dictionary containing all unique `(r_x, r_y)` pairs encountered during the loop, along with their frequencies; `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are the last values from the final tuple in `test_cases`.**

In simpler terms, after executing the line `results.append(count)`, the `results` list now contains the value of `count`, which is the total sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` found in `arr` according to the given conditions. The values of `r_x` and `r_y`, `current_key`, `residue_map`, `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their last computed values in the loop.
