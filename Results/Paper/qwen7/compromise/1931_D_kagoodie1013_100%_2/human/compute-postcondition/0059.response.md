Output State: **`count` is 0 plus the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `current_key` having a value of 1 more than its previous value, `num` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, and `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.**

Explanation:
- The code `r_x = -num % x` updates the value of `r_x` to be `-num % x`.
- The values of `count`, `r_y`, `current_key`, `residue_map`, `num`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
