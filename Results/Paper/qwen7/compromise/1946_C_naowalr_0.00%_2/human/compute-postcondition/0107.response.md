Output State: **`a` is the second integer entered, `b` is the first integer entered, `z` is `t`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list, `adj[a]` now contains the value `[b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a, a]**.

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `adj[a]` originally contained `[b]`, after appending `b` again, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
