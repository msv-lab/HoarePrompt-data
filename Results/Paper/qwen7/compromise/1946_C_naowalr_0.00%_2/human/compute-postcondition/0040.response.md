Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `x` is (L + R) // 2**

The code assigns the value of `(L + R) // 2` to the variable `x`. The initial state of `numCuts` is 0, and the condition that `R - L` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `x` and retains the original conditions for `numCuts` and the range difference.
