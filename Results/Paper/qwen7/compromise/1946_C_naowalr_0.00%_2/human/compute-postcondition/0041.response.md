Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `x` is (L + R) // 2**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` simply reassigns the value of `numCuts` to 0, which was already its initial value. The value of `x` remains unchanged as `(L + R) // 2`. Therefore, the only change is that `numCuts` is explicitly set to 0 again, but since it was already 0, this doesn't alter the state. The value of `x` stays as `(L + R) // 2`.
