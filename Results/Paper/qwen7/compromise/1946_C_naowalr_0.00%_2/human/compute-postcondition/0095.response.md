Output State: `i` is 0, `x` is a value between 1 and 100001 (inclusive), `adj` is a bidirectional adjacency list with `n` nodes, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will still be 0 because the loop condition `R - L > 1` will eventually become false, and the loop will terminate without changing `i`. The value of `x` will be the final midpoint value calculated during the last iteration of the loop, which is a value between 1 and 100001. The adjacency list `adj` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variables `L` and `R` will be equal, representing the final search range. `numCuts` remains 0 as no cuts are mentioned to be made inside the loop, and `leftover` will be the result of the final call to `dfs(1, 1)`.
