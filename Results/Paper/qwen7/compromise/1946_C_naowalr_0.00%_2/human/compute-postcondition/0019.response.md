Output State: **The loop will execute `n-1` times, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` will be `n-1`, `a` will be the integer value of the first input, `b` will be the integer value of the second input, and for every pair `(a, b)` provided as input, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain each other, forming an undirected graph where each node is connected to every other node exactly once. `L` is 1, `R` is 100001.**

Explanation: The code `R = int(100000.0 + 1)` assigns the value 100001 to the variable `R`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
