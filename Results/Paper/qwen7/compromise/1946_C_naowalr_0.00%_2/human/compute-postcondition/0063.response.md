Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `i` is `n-2`, and `adj[a]` includes `b`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. This means that the adjacency list for node `a` now includes `b`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the relationship between `adj[a]` and `b` is updated.
