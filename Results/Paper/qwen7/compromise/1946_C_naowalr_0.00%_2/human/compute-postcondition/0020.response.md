Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, the loop will execute `n-1` times, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` will be `n-1`, `a` will be the integer value of the first input, `b` will be the integer value of the second input, and for every pair `(a, b)` provided as input, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain each other, forming an undirected graph where each node is connected to every other node exactly once. `L` is 1, `R` is 100001.**

Explanation: The code initializes `numCuts` to 0. No other operations are performed, so the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `adj`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged from their initial states. The loop is still set to execute `n-1` times, and the conditions for the graph formation are also preserved.
