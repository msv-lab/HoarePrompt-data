Output State: **`z` is `t`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated value in input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated value in input**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input (stdin) separated by a space and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `z` is initialized to `t` in the initial state and remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are `n` and `k` holding the respective integers from the input, while `z` retains its initial value `t`.
