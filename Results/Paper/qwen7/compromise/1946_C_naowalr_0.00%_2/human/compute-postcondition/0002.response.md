Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number entered, `k` is an integer equal to the second number entered**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input, splits them using `map(int, ...)` to convert each string to an integer, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. Therefore, `n` and `k` now hold the values of the two integers entered, and these values are specific to the input provided. All other variables remain unaffected by this operation.
