Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
   - `i` is 0
   - `a` is the first integer input
   - `b` is the second integer input
   - `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n - 1`. Since `i` starts at 0 and `n` must be at least 2, the loop will run once.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 (since `n - 1` should still be greater than or equal to 1).

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `i` is 1
- `a` remains the first integer input
- `b` remains the second integer input
- `adj[b]` remains containing the value `[a]`

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`**
