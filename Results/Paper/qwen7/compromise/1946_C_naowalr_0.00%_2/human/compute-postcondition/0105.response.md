Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is an integer such that `n >= 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is the first integer entered.
   - `b` is the second integer entered.
   - `z` is `t`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list.
   - `adj[a]` now contains the value `[b]`.
   - `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1 (assuming it was 0 in the previous iteration).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` should be 1 and `n` should still be greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

6. **Final state**:
   - `a` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `b` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `z` remains `t` as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `k` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `adj` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `z` is `t`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list, `adj[a]` now contains the value `[b]`, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`**
