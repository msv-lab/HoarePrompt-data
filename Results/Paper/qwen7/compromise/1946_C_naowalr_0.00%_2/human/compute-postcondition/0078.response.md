Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is 50001, `adj` is a bidirectional adjacency list with `n` nodes, `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**.

Explanation: The code snippet `R = x` updates the value of `R` to be equal to the current value of `x`, which is 50001. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
