Output State: **`a` is the integer entered second, `b` is the integer entered first, `z` is `t`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list, `adj[a]` now contains the values `[b, b]`, `i` is `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contained `[b]`, which means `b` was already in `adj[b]`. Now, `a` is also appended to `adj[b]`, making `adj[b]` contain `[b, a]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
