Output State: **`L` is the left boundary, `R` is the right boundary, `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(L + R) // 2` to the variable `x`. This means `x` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R`. The values of `L` and `R` remain unchanged from their initial state.
