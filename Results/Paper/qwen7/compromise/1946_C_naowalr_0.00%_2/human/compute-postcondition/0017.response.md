Output State: The loop will execute `n-1` times. After all iterations, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` will be `n-1`, `a` will be the integer value of the first input, `b` will be the integer value of the second input, and for every pair `(a, b)` provided as input, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain each other, forming an undirected graph where each node is connected to every other node exactly once.

This means that `adj` will represent an undirected complete graph with `n` nodes, where each node is connected to every other node through exactly one edge.
