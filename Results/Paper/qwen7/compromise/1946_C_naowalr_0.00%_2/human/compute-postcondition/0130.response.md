Output State: **`numCuts` is 0; `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**

Explanation: The function `dfs(1, 1)` is called, and its return value is assigned to the variable `leftover`. The variable `numCuts` remains unchanged and is still 0. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `leftover` and the unchanged value of `numCuts`.
