Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains the value `b`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will contain `[b, a]`. However, since the initial state only mentions that `adj[b]` now contains the value `b`, we update it to show that `a` has been appended to the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
