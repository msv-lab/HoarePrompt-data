Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is 50001, `adj` is a bidirectional adjacency list with `n` nodes, `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1)**.

Explanation: The variable `L` is assigned the value of `x`, which is 50001. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
