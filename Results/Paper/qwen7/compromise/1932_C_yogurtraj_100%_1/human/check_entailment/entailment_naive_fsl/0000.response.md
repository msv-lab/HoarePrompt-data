Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the program does not handle the removal of elements from the array `a` as described. Instead of removing elements from the array based on the commands 'L' and 'R', the program calculates the product of the remaining elements but does not update the array accordingly. This means that the program will always output the same sequence of remainders, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```
- Expected Output:
```
0 2 4 1
```
- Actual Output (using the provided program):
```
0 0 0 0
```

This discrepancy shows that the program does not correctly remove elements from the array based on the commands, leading to incorrect results.
