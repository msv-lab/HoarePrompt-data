Postcondition: **`ii` is 0, `t` is an input string, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is updated to either `a[l - 2] * a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `a[l - 1] * a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q1` is either `l - 3` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l - 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q2` is either `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l + 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `y[-1]` is `k`, and the character at index `i` of `t` is either 'R' or not 'R'.**
