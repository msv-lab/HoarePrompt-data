Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is 2, `y[i]` is `k * a[q2] % m`, `q1` is 1 if `t[i] == 'R'` is true, otherwise `q1` is 0, `q2` is `q2 + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `q2 += 1` increments the value of `q2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `q2` is now one more than its original value, while `i`, `n`, `y[i]`, `q1`, and the condition for `q1` remain the same.
