Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` holds the final value after all multiplicative operations, `y` is a list where all elements are 0 except for the last one, which is equal to `k`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `a`. The variables `i`, `k`, `y`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new list `a` is created based on the user's input.
