Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is an integer, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, `y[-1]` is equal to `k`, `k` is `k * a[q2] % m`, `q2` is increased by 1, and the current value of `t[i]` is 'R'.**

Explanation: The line `q2 += 1` increments the value of `q2` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
