Output State: **`ii` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the standard input and splits them based on whitespace, converting them to integers and assigning them to `n` and `m` respectively. The initial values of `ii` and `t` remain unchanged.
