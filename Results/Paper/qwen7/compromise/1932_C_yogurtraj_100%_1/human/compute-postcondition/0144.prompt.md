Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for each a_i in a; s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    t = input()
    l = t.count('L')
    k = 0
    q1 = 0
    q2 = 0
    if t[-1] == 'L':
        k = a[l - 1] % m
        q1 = l - 2
        q2 = l
    else:
        k = a[l] % m
        q1 = l - 1
        q2 = l + 1
    y = [0] * n
    y[-1] = k
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if t[i] == 'R':
            k = k * a[q2] % m
            q2 += 1
        else:
            k = k * a[q1] % m
            q1 -= 1
        y[i] = k
    print(*y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `ii` is 0, `t` is an input string, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `l` is the number of occurrences of 'L' in the string `t`, `k` is updated to either `a[l - 2] * a[l - 1] % m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `a[l - 1] * a[l] % m` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q1` is `l - n + 1` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l - n` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L' or `l + n - 1` if the last character of `t` is not 'L', `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0, and the element at index `i` of `y` is `k` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `ii` remains 0. The string `t`, the integer `n`, and the integer `m` remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop. The list `a` is also unchanged. The variable `l` represents the count of 'L' characters in `t`. The variable `k` is updated based on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or not, and it is multiplied by appropriate elements of `a` and taken modulo `m` in each iteration of the loop. The variables `q1` and `q2` are adjusted based on the last character of `t` and the number of iterations completed. The list `y` is filled with the value of `k` at each index from 0 to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The variable `i` will be `-1` after the loop has executed all its iterations because the loop starts from `n - 2` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`. The variable `k` will be the final value after all the multiplications and mod operations have been performed based on the conditions inside the loop. The list `y` will have its last element `y[-1]` equal to the final value of `k`, and all other elements of `y` will still be `0`.

In natural language, after all the iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be `-1`, `k` will hold the result of all the multiplicative operations performed according to the conditions within the loop, and the list `y` will have all its elements set to `0` except for the last one, which will be equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is -1, n is 2, q1 is 0, q2 is 1, y is [k * a[1] % m, k * a[0] % m], k is k * a[0] % m.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
