Output State: **`n` is 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 2, `v` is `v - 1`, `u2vs[v]` now contains the value `[v-1, u, v-1, u]` appended to it, and `u` and `v` are assigned the values from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code takes two inputs, splits them, and maps them to integers, assigning these values to `u` and `v`. The initial state of `n` and the list `u2vs[v]` remains unchanged except for the new elements added to `u2vs[v]` which are `[v-1, u, v-1, u]`. The values of `u` and `v` are updated based on the input.
