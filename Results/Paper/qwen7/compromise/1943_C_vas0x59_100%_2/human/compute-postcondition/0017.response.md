Output State: **`n` is 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 3, `v` is `v - 2 - 1`, `u2vs[v]` now contains the value `[v-1, u, v-1, u]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The value of `v` is decremented by 1, so `v` is now `v - 2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
