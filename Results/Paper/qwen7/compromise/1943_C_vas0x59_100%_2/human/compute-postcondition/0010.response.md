Output State: **`n` is 1, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 2, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[v]` now contains the value `[v, u]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decrements the value of `u` by 1. Initially, `u` was an integer from the input decreased by 1. After executing the code, `u` becomes an integer from the input decreased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
