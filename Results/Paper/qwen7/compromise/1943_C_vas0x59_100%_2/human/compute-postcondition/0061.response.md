Output State: `ci` is 0, `i` is 1, `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1)]`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = ci`, where `ci` is initially 0. After each iteration, `ops` appends a tuple `(c, i)` to itself. Since `ci` does not change within the loop and remains 0, the loop will only execute once, appending the tuple `(0, 0)` to `ops`. However, based on the given output states after the first three iterations, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or error in the problem statement since `ci` should increment with each iteration if the loop were to run more than once. Given the provided information, the loop only runs once, and thus the final state matches the state after the first iteration.
