Postcondition: **`d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]` with at least 4 elements, `c1` is `b`, `c2` is 1, `ci1` is -1, `ci2` is 0, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `[(c1, 3), (c2, 3), (c2, 5)]` if `len(path_ba)` is odd, otherwise `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 1)]` if `len(path_ba)` is even and `ci` is 0, `i` is 1.**
