Output State: **`ci1` is -1, `ci2` is 0, `c1` is `b`, `d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1, n1, n2, ..., nk]`, where each `ni` represents the sequence of nodes traversed until the condition `n == -1` is met, and the current value of `n` is -1, `ops` is an empty list, and the length of `path_ba` is even.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `path_ba[ci1]` to `c1`. Given that `ci1` is -1, `c1` is assigned the value of `path_ba[-1]`, which is `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
