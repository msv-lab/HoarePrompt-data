Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length n where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000. The list `u2vs` remains unchanged, as the code only modifies `n`.
