The `while True` loop does not depend on any specific variables to terminate; it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly stopped. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the values `[b, -1],` and the current value of `n` is -1**
