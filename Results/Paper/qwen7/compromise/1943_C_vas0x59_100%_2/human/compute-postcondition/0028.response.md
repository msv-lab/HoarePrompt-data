Output State: **`d` is the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`, `n` is the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to `n`. Here, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`, which is the result of calling `func_1(d)`. So, `path_ba[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `path_ba`, which is `b`. Therefore, `n` is assigned the value of `previous[b]`. The states of the other variables (`d`, `b`, and `path_ba`) remain unchanged.
