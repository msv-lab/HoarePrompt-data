For the given `while True` loop, the loop will always execute because it is an infinite loop. There are no conditions based on external variables like in the previous examples. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`d` is assigned the result of the breadth-first search starting from index 0, `b` is the result of calling `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`**
