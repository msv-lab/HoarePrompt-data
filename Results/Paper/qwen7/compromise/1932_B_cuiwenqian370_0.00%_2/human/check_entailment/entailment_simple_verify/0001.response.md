### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires determining the year in which all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. Each sign occurs periodically, and the next sign can only occur strictly after the previous one.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function is indeed irrelevant to the problem. It is designed to handle a different kind of input (likely a string with characters '@' and '*') and does not address the periodicity of the signs.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, `func_1` is not correctly implemented for the given problem.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs.
   - The LCM of a list of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the list.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read the number of signs \( n \) and their periodicities \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).
   - Compute the LCM of these periodicities.
   - Output the LCM for each test case.

5. **Given Code Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` is completely unrelated to the problem and should be removed.
   - The function `func_2` attempts to process the input but incorrectly uses `func_1`, which is not designed to solve the problem.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code shows that `func_1` is not correctly handling the input and does not compute the LCM of the periodicities.
   - The annotated code also confirms that `func_2` is reading the input correctly but is using `func_1` instead of computing the LCM.

### Conclusion:
Since the given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem and includes an irrelevant function, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
