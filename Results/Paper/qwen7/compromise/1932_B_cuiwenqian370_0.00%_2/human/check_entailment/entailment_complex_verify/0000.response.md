### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not follow the problem description. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are unrelated to the problem of finding the year in which all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially based on their periodicities. Instead, they process a string with `@` and `*` characters, which is irrelevant to the actual problem.

The original assessment suggests a corrected version of the program that uses the least common multiple (LCM) to determine the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. This approach is correct because the LCM of the periodicities will indeed give the first year when all signs will occur simultaneously.

Given the annotations and the problem description, we can verify that the original assessment is accurate. The provided functions do not address the problem at hand, and the suggested correction using LCM is appropriate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. The provided solution in the original assessment is correct and addresses the problem properly.
