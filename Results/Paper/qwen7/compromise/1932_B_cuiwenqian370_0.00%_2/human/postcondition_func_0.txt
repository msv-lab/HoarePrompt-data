The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`, which is a list of characters. It initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` to keep track of certain values based on the characters in `path`. Depending on the first character of `path`, `dp[0]` is set to either 1 or `-inf`. For subsequent characters, `dp[i]` is calculated as the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1 if the current character is '@', or just the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` if the current character is '*'. Finally, the function returns 0 if no valid value in `dp` is greater than `-inf`, otherwise it returns the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than `-inf`.
