Postcondition: `dp` is a list of length `n` where either the first element is 1 and all other elements are 0, or the first element is `-inf` and all other elements are 0; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is greater than 1; `a_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `path[0]` is either '@' or '*'; if `path[1] == '*'`, the first element of `dp` remains `-inf`; if `path[1] == '@'`, `dp[1]` is `dp[0] + 1`; `path[0]` is either '@' or '*'.
