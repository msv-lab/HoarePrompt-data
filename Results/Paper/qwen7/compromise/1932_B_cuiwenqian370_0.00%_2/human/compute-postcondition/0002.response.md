Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element in the list `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from `sys.stdin.read` on whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[0])` takes the first element of the list `data` (which is expected to be a string representing an integer) and converts it into an integer, assigning it to `t`. The other parts of the list `data` remain unchanged.
