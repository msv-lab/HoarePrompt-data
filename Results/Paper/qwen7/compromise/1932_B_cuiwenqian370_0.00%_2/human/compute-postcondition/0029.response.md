Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(2, n)`. Therefore, we need to focus on adjusting the states of these variables.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i < n`. This means that before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 2, and `n` should be greater than 2 (since the loop condition requires `i < n`).

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` should be set to 2.
   - `n` should be greater than 1 (as given in the postcondition), but since the loop starts at `i = 2`, `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`dp`, `t`, `path`, and `a_i`) are not directly involved in the loop initialization and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state after adjustment for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2**.
