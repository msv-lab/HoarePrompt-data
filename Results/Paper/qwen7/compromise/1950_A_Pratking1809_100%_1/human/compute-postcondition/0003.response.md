Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', based on the comparison of integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each iteration of the loop. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `q`. Each line's content depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` entered during each iteration.
