State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` is an input integer, `i` must be 0 and `q` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `q`.
2. For the loop to execute, `q` must be a positive integer because `range(q)` generates numbers from 0 to `q-1`.
3. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, as `range(q)` starts counting from 0.
4. The value of `t` (which is between 1 and 1000) does not affect the loop's execution condition directly, but it is mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to be 0 and `q` to be greater than 0.
