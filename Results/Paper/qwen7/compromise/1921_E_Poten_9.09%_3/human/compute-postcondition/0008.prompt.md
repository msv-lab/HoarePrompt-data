You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b such that 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.

    #State: Output State: `answers` is a list containing the outcomes ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') for each iteration of the loop based on the input provided during the loop's execution. The exact contents of the list depend on the input values given for each test case within the specified range (1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4).
    for j in answers:
        print(j)
        
    #State: The output state will be a series of lines, each containing one element from the `answers` list, printed in the order they appear in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) as inputs. It validates that each test case meets specific conditions: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and ensures either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The function also guarantees that the sum of h across all test cases does not exceed 10^6. Based on these inputs, the function returns a result that depends on the validation and conditions provided.
