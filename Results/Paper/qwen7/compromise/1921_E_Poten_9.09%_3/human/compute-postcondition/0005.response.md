State before the loop starts: `answers` is an empty list since no outcomes have been generated yet. The loop variable `j` will iterate over the elements in `answers`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the initial state of the loop variables and the conditions under which the loop will run. In this case, the loop will run as long as there are elements in the `answers` list.

Since the loop is iterating over the elements in `answers`, the only relevant state to adjust is the state of the `answers` list. The loop will execute if `answers` contains at least one element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `answers` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`answers` is a non-empty list containing outcomes ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw')**
