Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the outcome of the game. Specifically, the program does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Here is an example to demonstrate this:

Consider the following test case:
```
6 5 2 2 5 3
```
- Alice starts at (2, 2).
- Bob starts at (5, 3).

According to the rules:
- Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left.
- Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left.

Let's analyze the moves:
- Alice can move to (3, 2), (3, 1), or (3, 3).
- Bob can move to (4, 3), (4, 2), or (4, 4).

The program incorrectly checks the parity of the coordinates and the absolute difference between them, which does not fully capture the strategic aspects of the game. For instance, the program does not account for the fact that Alice can force a win by moving to a position that blocks Bob's optimal moves.

To properly determine the outcome, the program needs to consider the relative positions and the possible moves of both players more comprehensively. The current implementation does not handle all edge cases and strategic possibilities, leading to incorrect outcomes in certain scenarios.
