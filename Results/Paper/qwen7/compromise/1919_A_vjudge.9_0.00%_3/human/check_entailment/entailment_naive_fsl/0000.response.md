Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not simulate the game process where players take turns and remove coins from their wallets. Instead, they simply determine the winner based on whether the sum of the initial number of coins in both wallets is even or odd.

This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the actual game mechanics, such as the ability to swap wallets and the constraint that a player's wallet cannot have 0 coins before removing a coin. For example, consider the test case where Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 1 coin:

- According to the problem description, if Alice chooses not to swap wallets, she will lose immediately since her wallet will become empty after removing the coin.
- However, the provided solution incorrectly determines that Bob will win in this case.

To correctly solve this problem, the solution needs to simulate the game process, taking into account the optimal moves for both players. The current implementation does not do this, hence it is incorrect.
