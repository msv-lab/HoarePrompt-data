### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Each player alternates turns.
   - On each turn, a player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallets.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If both players play optimally, the game essentially boils down to the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If `a + b` is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by mirroring Alice's moves (i.e., swapping when Alice doesn't swap, and vice versa). This ensures that Bob will be the last to make a move.
   - If `a + b` is odd, Alice can mirror Bob's moves similarly, ensuring she will be the last to make a move.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly checks the parity of `a + b`.
   - If `a + b` is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If `a + b` is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
   - However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation. The function does not account for the fact that the game continues until one player cannot make a valid move. The function simply checks the parity of the total number of coins without considering the sequence of moves.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1` to determine the winner, and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the initial values of `a` and `b`, but it does not simulate the actual game process. It only checks the parity of the total number of coins, which is not sufficient to determine the winner in all cases.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\).

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
  - If `a + b` is even, it returns 'Bob'.
  - If `a + b` is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
  - However, this check does not consider the sequence of moves and the fact that the game continues until one player cannot make a valid move.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1` to determine the winner, and stores the result.
  - It then prints the results for all test cases.
  - The function `func_1` is called with the initial values of `a` and `b`, but it does not simulate the actual game process. It only checks the parity of the total number of coins, which is not sufficient to determine the winner in all cases.

### Example Analysis:

Let's analyze the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 1`
  - `a + b = 2` (even)
  - `func_1(1, 1)` returns 'Bob'
  - **Actual Outcome:** Bob wins because Alice cannot make a valid move after removing a coin from her empty wallet.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `1 4`
  - `a + b = 5` (odd)
  - `func_1(1, 4)` returns 'Alice'
  - **Actual Outcome:** Alice wins because she can mirror Bob's moves and ensure she is the last to make a move.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` correctly checks the parity of the total number of coins, but it does not simulate the actual game process. The function `func_2` calls `func_1` with the initial values of `a` and `b`, which is not sufficient to determine the winner in all cases. The function does not account for the sequence of moves and the fact that the game continues until one player cannot make a valid move.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is not correct because it does not fully simulate the game process and only checks the parity of the total number of coins, which is not sufficient to determine the winner in all cases.
