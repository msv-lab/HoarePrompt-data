Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins they each have in their wallets.
2. The game rules state that a player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses.
3. The provided solution uses a function `func_1` to determine the winner based on the parity (even or odd) of the sum of the coins in both wallets.
4. The logic in `func_1` is correct: if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, `func_1` returns 'Bob', and if the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'. This is because:
   - If the sum is even, Bob can always force the sum to be odd after his turn, ensuring he can always make a move when it's his turn.
   - If the sum is odd, Alice can always force the sum to be even after her turn, ensuring she can always make a move when it's her turn.
5. The main function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the result for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the game rules and the provided examples match the expected outcomes.

Correctness: **True**
