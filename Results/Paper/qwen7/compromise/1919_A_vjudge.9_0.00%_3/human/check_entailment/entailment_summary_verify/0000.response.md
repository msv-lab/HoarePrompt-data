### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description and Game Mechanics:
- Players take turns removing 1 coin from their wallet.
- If a player's wallet becomes empty before removing a coin, they lose.
- Both players play optimally.

#### Function Summaries:
- `func_1(a, b)`: Determines the winner based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- `func_2()`: Processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1(a, b)` for each pair `(a, b)` and prints the results.

#### Analysis of `func_1(a, b)`:
- If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, `func_1` returns 'Bob'.
- Otherwise, `func_1` returns 'Alice'.

#### Analysis of `func_2()`:
- `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result.
- Finally, it prints the results.

#### Correctness of the Approach:
The key insight here is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (even or odd nature) of the total number of coins. Here's why:

1. **Initial Parity Check**: If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob will always win if both players play optimally. This is because:
   - Alice starts with an even total.
   - Each turn reduces the total by 1 (since a player removes 1 coin).
   - An even total minus 1 is odd, and an odd total minus 1 is even.
   - Therefore, after each turn, the parity alternates between even and odd.
   - Since the game ends when a player's wallet is empty (which happens when the total is reduced to 0, an even number), the player who faces an even total will be the last to make a move and thus win.

2. **Odd Total Case**: If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally. This is because:
   - Alice starts with an odd total.
   - The parity will alternate between odd and even.
   - Since the game ends at 0 (an even number), the player who faces an odd total will be the last to make a move and thus win.

Given these observations, the function `func_1(a, b)` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The function `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided solution correctly implements the game logic by determining the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The program does not need to simulate the entire game process; it only needs to check the parity of the total number of coins.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
