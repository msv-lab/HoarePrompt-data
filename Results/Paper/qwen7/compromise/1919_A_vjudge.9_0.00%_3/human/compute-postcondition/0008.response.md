Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and pairs of positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns either an integer or a string based on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `t`.**

Given the constraints and the implied nature of the function, it appears the function processes multiple test cases, each containing `t`, `a`, and `b`. However, since the function definition does not explicitly list `t`, `a`, and `b` as parameters, the function likely receives these as part of an external structure (like a list of test cases) and processes them accordingly. The exact processing logic isn't detailed here, but the function's role is to handle these inputs and produce a result for each test case.
