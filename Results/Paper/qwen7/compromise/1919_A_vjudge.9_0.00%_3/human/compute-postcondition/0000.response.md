Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code reads an input for the number of test cases and converts it to an integer, updating the value of `t`. Since the input range for `t` is specified as 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, this is the updated state for `t`. The initial conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not involved in this piece of code.
