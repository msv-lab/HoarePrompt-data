Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing an array \(a\) such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).
2. The provided solution initializes \(a[0]\) to 500 and then sets each subsequent \(a[i]\) to \(a[i-1] + x[i-1]\). This approach does not guarantee that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following example:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  2 4 1
  ```

- Expected output:
  - A valid sequence could be \(a = [3, 5, 4, 9]\), as shown in the problem statement.

- Actual output from the provided code:
  - The code would set \(a = [500, 502, 506, 507]\), which does not satisfy the required condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).

Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
