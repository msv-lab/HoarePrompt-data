Output State: The list `a` will be transformed such that each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will hold the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` will remain unchanged, and `a[0]` will still be 500. The variable `x` will also remain unchanged.

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `a` will start with `a[0] = 500` and then each subsequent element `a[i]` will be the sum of `500` and the first `i` elements of `x`. The variable `i` will be set to `n`, showing that the loop has run `n-1` times.
