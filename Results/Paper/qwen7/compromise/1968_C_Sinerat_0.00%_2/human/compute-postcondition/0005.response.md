Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` should be 1 initially.

3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be set to 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `a[0]` is 500.

Since these variables are not directly involved in the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
