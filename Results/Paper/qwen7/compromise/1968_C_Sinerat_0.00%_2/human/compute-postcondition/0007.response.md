Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a[i]` is `a[0] + x[0]`

4. **Determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Determine the new condition for `n`**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 2) must still be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - The value of `a[i]` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop itself but rather by the initial conditions or the loop body (which is omitted).

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
