Output State: **`_` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is `int(input())`, `a` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `x` is a list of integers split from the input string, `a[0]` is 500.**

Explanation: The code sets the first element of list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) to 500. All other variables and their initial states remain unchanged.
