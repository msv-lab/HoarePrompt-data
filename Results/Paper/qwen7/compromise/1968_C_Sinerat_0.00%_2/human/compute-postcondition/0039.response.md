Output State: The list `a` will contain `n` elements where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is calculated as `a[i] = 500 + sum(x[0:i])`. The variable `x` remains unchanged, `i` is `n`, and `n` remains its original value.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `a` will have each element starting from `a[0] = 500` and each subsequent element will be the previous element plus the corresponding value from the list `x`. The variable `x` and the value of `n` stay the same as they were initially.
