Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (since the loop starts with `range(1, n)`).
   - `n` is obtained from `int(input())`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop starts with `range(1, n)`, meaning `i` will iterate from 1 up to but not including `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` is already set to 1, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other relevant states**:
   - The initial value of `a[0]` is 500, but this is not part of the loop head and doesn't affect the loop's execution directly.
   - The state of `x` (the list of integers split from the input string) is not relevant to the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
