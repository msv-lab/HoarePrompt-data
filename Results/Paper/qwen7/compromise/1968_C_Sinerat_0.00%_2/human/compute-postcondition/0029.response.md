Output State: **`_` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is `int(input())`**

Explanation: The first `int(input())` in the initial state is subtracted by 1 to assign the value to `_`. The second `int(input())` in the code snippet assigns its value to `n`. Both inputs must satisfy the condition that the second input (assigned to `n`) is greater than or equal to the first input (assigned to `_`). The output state reflects these assignments while maintaining the original condition.
