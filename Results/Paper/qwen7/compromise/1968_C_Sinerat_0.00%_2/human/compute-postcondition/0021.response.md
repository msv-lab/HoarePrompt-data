Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which is now 2. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - The value of `a[1]` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`**
