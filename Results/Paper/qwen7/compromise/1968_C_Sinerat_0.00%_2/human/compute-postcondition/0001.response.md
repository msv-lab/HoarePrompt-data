Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
