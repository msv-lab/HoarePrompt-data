Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`
   - `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, and `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3 because if `n` was 3 or less, the loop would not continue.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3.

6. **Consider the list `a`**:
   - The values of `a[1]` and `a[2]` are already determined based on the previous iterations and do not change within this loop iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`**
