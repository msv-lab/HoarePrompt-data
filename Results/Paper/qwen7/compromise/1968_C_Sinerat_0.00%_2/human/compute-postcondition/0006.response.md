Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[i]` is `a[0] + x[0]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i - 1]` corresponds to `a[0]` and `x[i - 1]` corresponds to `x[0]`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `a[0]` and `x[0]`, we express `a[i]` as the sum of these two values. The conditions and values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
