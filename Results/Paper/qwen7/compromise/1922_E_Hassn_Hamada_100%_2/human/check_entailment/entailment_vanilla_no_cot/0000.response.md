Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence based on a specific algorithm that doesn't directly relate to generating an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic within `func_1` is complex and not clearly aligned with the problem requirements.

2. **Output Format**: The program prints the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself. However, the generated sequences do not necessarily have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. For instance, the output for `X = 2` is `0`, which is not a valid array of integers as per the problem statement.

3. **Algorithmic Approach**: The problem requires finding an array where the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. The given solution does not address this requirement. Instead, it seems to be trying to construct a sequence using bitwise operations, which is not relevant to the problem.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to use combinatorial methods or dynamic programming to ensure that the constructed array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The provided code does not achieve this.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Using combinatorial mathematics to determine the structure of the array.
- Ensuring the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

Hereâ€™s a conceptual outline of how a correct solution might look:
1. Determine the structure of the array based on the value of `X`.
2. Construct the array accordingly.
3. Ensure the constructed array meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

Given the complexity, a detailed implementation would be necessary, but the current provided solution does not meet these criteria.
