Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, up to a maximum length of 200. The provided solution attempts to solve this by recursively constructing the sequence using a helper function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function aims to construct a sequence that matches the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The key logic involves calculating the size and value needed to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles the base case correctly when `number` is 0.
   - It iteratively constructs the sequence by appending values based on the calculated size and overlap.
   - The recursive call adjusts the remaining number of subsequences to achieve the desired count.

4. **Execution States**:
   - The annotated states correctly describe the progression of the function.
   - The sequence construction logic aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The recursive calls ensure that the sequence is built to match the desired number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The output format is correct, printing the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself.
   - The logic handles both the case where a valid sequence can be constructed and the case where it cannot (returning -1).

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence with the specified number of increasing subsequences, adhering to the constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
