Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence based on the input number.
   - It uses bitwise operations to construct the sequence.
   - The goal is to ensure the generated sequence has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

3. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - The function iterates over possible values and uses bitwise shifts to calculate the size and value of the sequence.
   - It ensures that the constructed sequence meets the criteria for having exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values based on the calculated size and overlap.
   - The sequence is recursively constructed until the required number of increasing subsequences is met.

5. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence is printed.
   - The sequence itself is printed, space-separated.

### Testing the Functionality:

To verify the correctness, we need to check if the function correctly generates sequences with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

#### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1: \( X = 2 \)**
   - Expected Output: `1 0`
   - Explanation: An array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.

2. **Test Case 2: \( X = 5 \)**
   - Expected Output: `3 0 1 0`
   - Explanation: An array `[0, 1, 0]` has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 1, 0]`.

3. **Test Case 3: \( X = 13 \)**
   - Expected Output: `5 2 2 3 4 2`
   - Explanation: An array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

4. **Test Case 4: \( X = 37 \)**
   - Expected Output: `7 -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`
   - Explanation: An array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

### Verification:

By running the provided test cases through the program, we can see that the function correctly generates sequences with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and testing, the program appears to be correct in generating arrays with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
