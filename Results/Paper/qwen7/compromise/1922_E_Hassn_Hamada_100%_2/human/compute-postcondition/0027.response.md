Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence minus 1; `size` is `i + 3`; `value` is `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`; `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\)**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `value` is defined as \((1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)\).
- After executing `value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)`, `value` is updated to \((1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)\).
- The other variables (`i`, `size`, and `number`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `value` and retains the initial conditions of the other variables.
