Output State: **`size` is 5, `overlap` is 2, `value` is 30, `i` is 2, `sequence` contains [2, 4]**.

The code appends the value of `i + overlap` to the list `sequence`. Given that `i` is 2 and `overlap` is 2, `i + overlap` equals 4. Therefore, the sequence list is updated to include 4, making it `[2, 4]`. The values of `size`, `value`, and `i` remain unchanged.
