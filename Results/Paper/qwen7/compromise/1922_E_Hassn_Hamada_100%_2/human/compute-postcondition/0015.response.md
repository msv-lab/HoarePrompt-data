Output State: **`size` is increased by 1, `value` is 2^`size` - 2^`i`**

Explanation: The code `value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)` calculates `value` as \(2^{\text{size}} - 2^{\text{i}}\). Since `size` was initially increased by 1, it is now `size + 1`. The value of `value` is determined by the current values of `size` and `i`. Therefore, `value` is calculated as \(2^{\text{size} + 1} - 2^{\text{i}}\).
