Output State: `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`, `size` is `i + 4`, and `value` is `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `size` will be incremented by 1 each time the loop runs. Since we know from the given information that the loop executes 3 times, `size` will be `i + 3 + 1` which simplifies to `i + 4`. The `value` is calculated as `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, so with `size` being `i + 4`, the final `value` will be `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)`.
