Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence, `size` is `i + 9`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 7)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\), and `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `size` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `size` and `i` to the variable `size_overlap` as a tuple. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
