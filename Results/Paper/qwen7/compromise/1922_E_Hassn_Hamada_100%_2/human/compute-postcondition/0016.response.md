Output State: `i` remains as `max(sequence, default=0)`, `size` is `i + 3`, and `value` is `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << max(sequence, default=0))`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` does not change from its initial value because it is not modified within the loop. The `size` variable keeps increasing by 1 with each iteration until the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number` is met. After 3 iterations, `size` becomes `i + 3`. The `value` is updated in each iteration to be `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, which for 3 iterations results in `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << max(sequence, default=0))`.
