Output State: **`i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`, `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`**

Explanation: 
- The initial state of `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`, which means `i` is the maximum value in `sequence` or 0 if `sequence` is empty.
- The code updates two new variables: `size` and `value`.
  - `size` is assigned the value of `i + 1`.
  - `value` is calculated using the bitwise shift operator. Specifically, `1 << (i + 1)` shifts 1 left by `i + 1` positions, and `1 << i` shifts 1 left by `i` positions. The expression `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)` calculates the difference between these two values, which results in a value with a single bit set to 1 at position `i + 1`.

Therefore, the updated states are as described above.
