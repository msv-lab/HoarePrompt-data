Output State: `i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 5`; `value` is \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)\); `number` must be at least \(31 \cdot (1 << i)\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`.

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is the maximum value in the sequence minus one. The `size` increases by 1 with each iteration, so after 4 iterations (since we start from `i + 2` and add 1 for each of the 3 given iterations, plus one more), `size` becomes `i + 5`. The `value` doubles with each iteration, starting from \((1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)\) and ending at \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)\). The condition on `number` also increases, being at least \(31 \cdot (1 << i)\) after 4 iterations. The `size_overlap` remains as a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`, as it is not affected by the loop's execution.
