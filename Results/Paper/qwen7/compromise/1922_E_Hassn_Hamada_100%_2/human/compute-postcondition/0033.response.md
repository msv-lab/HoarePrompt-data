Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence, `size` is `i + 7`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 5)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\), `value` is \((1 << (i + 7)) - (1 << i)\)**

Explanation: The value of `value` is updated to \((1 << (i + 7)) - (1 << i)\). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
