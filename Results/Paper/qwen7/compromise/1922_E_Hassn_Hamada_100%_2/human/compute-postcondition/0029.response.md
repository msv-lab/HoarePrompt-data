Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence minus 1, `size` is `i + 5`, `value` is \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)\), `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\)**

Explanation: The code `size += 1` increments the value of `size` by 1. Initially, `size` was `i + 4`. After the increment, `size` becomes `i + 5`. The values of `i`, `value`, and `number` remain unchanged.
