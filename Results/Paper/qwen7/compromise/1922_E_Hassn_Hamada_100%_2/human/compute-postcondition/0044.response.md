Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 2`; `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`; `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`**.

Explanation: The variable `size` was originally `i + 1`. After executing `size += 1`, `size` is now `i + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
