Postcondition: `i` is the maximum value in the sequence, `size` is `i + 9`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 7)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\), and `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `size` and `i`. If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
