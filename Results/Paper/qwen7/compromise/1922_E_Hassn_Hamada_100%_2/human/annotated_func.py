    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - overlap - 1`, which means it will run from `i = 0` to `i = 3` (since `size` is 5 and `overlap` is 2). After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be 3. The `sequence` list will contain the values `[2, 4, 6]`, as each iteration appends `i + overlap` to the list, starting from `2` (when `i = 0`) and ending with `6` (when `i = 3`).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a new sequence based on the input `number` and modifies the `sequence` list by appending specific values to it. Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated parameters until `number` becomes 0, at which point it returns the tuple (0, 0).
