Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly initializes the necessary variables and reads the input matrix representing the transition videos between scenarios. This part is correct.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S' Videos**: The program correctly counts the number of 'F' and 'S' videos for each scenario. This is done using the lists `a` and `b`.

3. **Separating Decided and Undecided Videos**: The program correctly separates the indices of scenarios with decided ('F' or 'S') and undecided ('?') transition videos into `sa` and `sb` respectively. This separation is crucial for deciding how to fill the remaining undecided videos.

4. **Decision Logic**: The decision logic in the `if` block is designed to prioritize 'F' videos over 'S' videos if there are more undecided 'F' videos than 'S' videos. Similarly, the `else` block prioritizes 'S' videos. This logic is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

5. **Constructing the Final Transition Video Plan**: The program constructs the final transition video plan by iterating through the input matrix and filling in the undecided '?' values based on the prioritization logic. This construction process is correct and ensures that the constraints are met.

6. **Output**: The program outputs the final transition video plan, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It handles all the necessary steps and constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
