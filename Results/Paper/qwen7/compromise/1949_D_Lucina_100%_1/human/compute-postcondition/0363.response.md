Output State: **`j` is 1 or 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `nx` is equal to `nx` plus `xx[i][j - 1]` which can be either `nx` or '?'**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to it. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` can be either `nx` or '?', the value of `nx` will be updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
