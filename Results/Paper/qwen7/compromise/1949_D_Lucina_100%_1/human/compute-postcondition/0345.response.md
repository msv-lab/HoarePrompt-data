Output State: **i is 1, j is n, n is at least 2, nx is a string of length n-1 consisting of 'S', 'F', or '?', and xx[1][0] remains unchanged and stays as '?'.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will remain 1 because the loop only increments `j`. The final value of `j` will be `n`, as the loop runs from 1 to `n`. The variable `nx` will be a string of length `n-1` because the loop iterates `n` times but starts from `j=1`. Each character in `nx` can be either 'S', 'F', or '?' based on the conditions inside the loop. The value of `xx[1][0]` remains unchanged and stays as '?'.
