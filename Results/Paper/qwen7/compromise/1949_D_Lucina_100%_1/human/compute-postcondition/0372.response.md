Output State: **`j` is 2 or 3, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is a string that ends with 'S'**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since the initial state does not specify what `nx` is, we can only say that after executing the code, `nx` will be the original value of `nx` plus the character 'S'. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
