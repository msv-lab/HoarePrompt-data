Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is either 2 or 3.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is either 2 or 3.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be within the range of 1 to `n` (inclusive).
   - Since `j` was either 2 or 3 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` would be 3 if `j` was 2, and 4 if `j` was 3.
   - However, since `j` must be within the range of 1 to `n`, and `n` is an integer between 2 and 24, `j` can only be 4 if `n` is at least 4.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `j`.
   - Therefore, `j` must be set to 4 for the next iteration to occur.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the loop condition and does not change within the loop itself.

6. **Final State:**
   - `j` is now 4.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 4, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\)**.
