Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 4, `x` is an input string, `a` and `b` are determined based on the characters in the string `x`, `b[j]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 4, `b[4]` is increased by 1. All other variables (`i`, `j`, `x`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
