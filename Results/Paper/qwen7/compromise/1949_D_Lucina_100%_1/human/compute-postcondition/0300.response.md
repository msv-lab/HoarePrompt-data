Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `nx` is either 'F' followed by 'S' or 'S' followed by 'S', `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and if `i` is in the range from `0` to `n // 4 - 1` or `j` (now 2) is in the same range, then `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` remains 'F' or changes to 'SF' if it was originally 'S', or remains 'F' if it was originally 'F'.
