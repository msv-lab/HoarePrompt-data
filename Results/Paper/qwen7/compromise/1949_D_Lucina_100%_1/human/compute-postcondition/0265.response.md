Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 24, `sa` will contain all indices i (from 2 to n) where a[i] > 0 and b[i] == 0, and `sb` will contain all indices i (from 2 to n) where b[i] > 0 and a[i] == 0; `sb` now includes index `i`.**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `sb`. Since `i` starts at 1 and the range for `i` is from 2 to `n`, the first value appended to `sb` is 1, even though it's outside the specified range (2 to n). However, since the initial postconditions specify that `sb` contains indices from 2 to `n`, the state of `sb` remains consistent with the initial conditions, just with the new value included. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `sa`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
