Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `n` (where `j` is the iterator and `n` is the upper limit of the range).

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is given as 1.
   - `n` is given as being between 2 and 24.
   - `nx` is an empty string.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states of the objects in the loop head**:
   - `j` will start at 1 and increment until it reaches `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged within the loop.

5. **Ensure the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `j` starting at 1 and `n` being at least 2.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is an empty string**
