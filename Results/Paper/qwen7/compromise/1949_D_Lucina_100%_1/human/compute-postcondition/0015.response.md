Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), and the element at index `j-1` of `x` is 'S', `b[1]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, the code effectively increases `b[1]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
