Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts with `j = 1` and goes up to `n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` remains as '?'

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented to 2 (since `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`).
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - `i` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `nx` remains unchanged.
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` remains as '?'.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 2 (since `j` was 1 and it needs to be incremented to 2)
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `nx` is either 'S' or 'F'
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` remains as '?'

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is either 'S' or 'F', and `xx[i][j - 1]` remains as '?'**
