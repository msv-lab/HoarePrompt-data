Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is between 2 and 24, `sa` will contain all indices \( i \) (from 2 to \( n \)) where \( a[i] > 0 \) and \( b[i] == 0 \), and `sb` will contain all indices \( i \) (from 2 to \( n \)) where \( b[i] > 0 \) and \( a[i] == 0 \). If \( a[i] == 0 \) and \( b[i] == 0 \), then `sb` now includes index \( i \).

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n + 1`. During each iteration, the loop checks if `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. If both conditions are met, the index `i` is appended to `sb`. Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n + 1`, it will check all indices from 1 to `n + 1`. However, the loop only appends indices from 2 to `n` to `sb` based on the given conditions. Therefore, after the loop completes, `sb` will contain all indices \( i \) (from 2 to \( n \)) where \( b[i] > 0 \) and \( a[i] == 0 \), provided these conditions were met during the loop's execution. The value of `n` remains unchanged as per the problem statement.
