Output State: **`nx` ends with 'F', `j` is incremented by 1, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `xx[i][j]` is either not '?' or equals '?'. If `xx[i][j]` is not '?', `nx` is equal to the previous value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j]`. If `xx[i][j]` is '?', then `nx` remains a string. If i is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` ends with 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` ends with 'S'**.

Explanation:
- The line `nx += 'F'` appends 'F' to the end of the string `nx`.
- The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged except that `j` is incremented by 1.
- The conditions regarding `xx[i][j]` and the ending character of `nx` remain the same.
