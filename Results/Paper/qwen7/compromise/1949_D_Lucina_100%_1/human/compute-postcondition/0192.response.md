Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `nx` is an empty string (not involved in the loop).
   - `i` is 1 (not involved in the loop).
   - `j` is `n + 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `j` must be within the range of 1 to `n + 1`.
   - Initially, `j` is set to `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` is initially `n + 1`, the loop will not execute because `j` is already out of the range [1, n+1) when the loop starts.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is within the range [1, n+1). Specifically, `j` should be 1 or any value less than or equal to `n`.

Given this, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`nx` is an empty string, `i` is 1, `j` must be between 1 and n inclusive**
