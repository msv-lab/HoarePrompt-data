Postcondition: **`xx` is a list containing the string `x`, `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `2`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is `2`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[1]` is incremented by 1.**
