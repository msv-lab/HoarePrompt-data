Output State: **`nx` is 'FF', `i` is 1, `j` is `k + 1`**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the existing value of `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'. Since the condition for `nx` being 'F' is met (either `i` is between 1 and `n`//4 - 1 or `j` is between 1 and `n`//4 - 1), `nx` is initially 'F'. After appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'FF'. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged from their previous iteration values, so `i` is still 1 and `j` is `k + 1` from the previous iteration.
