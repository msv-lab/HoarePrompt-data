Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `j` will be `n+1`, `n` will still be an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), and the values of `a` and `b` will be determined based on the characters in the string `x`.**

To explain further, after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. The variable `j` will be `n + 1` because the loop increments `j` from 1 to `n`, and then `j` is no longer within the range specified by the loop. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The arrays `a` and `b` will contain values based on the characters in the string `x`. Specifically, for each index `k` from 1 to `n`:
- If `x[k-1]` is 'F', then `a[k]` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'F' at position `k-1`.
- If `x[k-1]` is 'S', then `b[k]` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence of 'S' at position `k-1`.

Indices in `a` and `b` correspond to the positions in the string `x` (with `a[k]` corresponding to `x[k-1]` and `b[k]` also corresponding to `x[k-1]`). Indices where `x[k-1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S' will result in those indices in `a` and `b` remaining unchanged.
