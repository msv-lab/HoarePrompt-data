Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `xx` is a list containing the string `x`.
   - `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`.
   - `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `x` remains as the input string.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means the loop will run `n` times, with `i` taking values from 1 to `n`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, at the start of the first iteration, `i` is 1.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`.

5. **Calculate the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - All other variables (`xx`, `a`, `b`, `j`, and `x`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`xx` is a list containing the string `x`; `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`; `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`; `i` is `n + 1`; `j` is `n + 1`; `x` remains as the input string.**
