Postcondition: `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` can be either 'SSF' or 'SFF', and `xx[1][1]` remains unchanged and stays as '?'.

This postcondition states that after the if-else block executes, `i` and `j` remain unchanged at 1 and 3 respectively, `n` must still be at least 2, `nx` can take on the values 'SSF' or 'SFF', and the value of `xx[1][1]` remains unchanged and stays as '?'.
