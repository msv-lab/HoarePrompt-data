Postcondition: **`i` will be equal to `n + 1`, `sa` will contain all indices `i` (from 2 to `n`) where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `sb` will contain all indices `i` (from 2 to `n`) where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and must be between 2 and 24. Additionally, the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.**
