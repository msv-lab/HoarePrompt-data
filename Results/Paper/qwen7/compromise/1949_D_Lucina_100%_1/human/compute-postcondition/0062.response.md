Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `j` is 3, `x` is an input string, `a` and `b` are determined based on the characters in the string `x`, and `xx` contains the string `x`. If `x[j - 1]` (which is `x[2]`) is 'F', then the element at index 3 in the list `a` is incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then the element at index 2 in the list `b` is incremented by 1.
