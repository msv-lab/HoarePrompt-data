Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be between `2` and `24`.
   - `nx` is either 'F' followed by 'S' or 'S' followed by 'S'.
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'.
   - If `i` is in the range from `0` to `n // 4 - 1` or `j` (now 2) is in the same range, `nx` is 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` remains as it was originally.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `1` and goes up to `n + 1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `1`, so `j` will become `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same, so it still must be between `2` and `24`.
   - `nx` remains the same unless the conditions in the loop body change it.
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` will now be `xx[i][(n + 1) - 1] = xx[i][n]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between `2` and `24`, `nx` is either 'F' followed by 'S' or 'S' followed by 'S', and `xx[i][n]` is undefined (since no value is given for this specific position)**.
