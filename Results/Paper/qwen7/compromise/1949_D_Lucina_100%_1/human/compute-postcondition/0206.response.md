Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'.
   - If `i` is between 1 and `n`//4 - 1 or `j` is between 1 and `n`//4 - 1, then `nx` is 'F'.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the string formed by concatenating the character at position `i` in `xx` with the character at position `j-1` in `xx`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is between 1 and `n` inclusive.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is fixed at 1, we need to consider the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range 1 to `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so if `j` was `k` (where `k` is between 1 and `n`), it will become `k + 1`.

Given that `j` is between 1 and `n` inclusive, let's assume `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.

Since `j` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, and it must be within the range 1 to `n + 1`, the new state will be:

State: **`nx` is either 'F' or 'S'. If `i` is between 1 and `n`//4 - 1 or `j` is between 1 and `n`//4 - 1, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the string formed by concatenating the character at position `i` in `xx` with the character at position `j-1` in `xx`, and `i` is 1, `j` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. After the previous iteration, `j` was `k`, so for the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.**

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`nx` is either 'F' or 'S'. If `i` is between 1 and `n`//4 - 1 or `j` is between 1 and `n`//4 - 1, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the string formed by concatenating the character at position `i` in `xx` with the character at position `j-1` in `xx`, and `i` is 1, `j` is between 1 and `n` inclusive. After the previous iteration, `j` was `k`, so for the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1`.**
