Output State: **`xx` is a list containing the string `x`, `a` is a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `b` is a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `2`, `a[j]` is `2` since `x[j-1]` is 'F' and `a[j-1]` is `1`.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is `1`, initially `a[1]` was `1` (since `a[i]` is `a[i-1] + 1` and `i` is `n + 1`, making `a[n+1]` the first element in the list `a` which is `1`). After incrementing, `a[1]` becomes `2`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
