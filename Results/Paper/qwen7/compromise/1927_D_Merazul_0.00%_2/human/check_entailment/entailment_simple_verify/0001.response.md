### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided Python function `func()` step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We are given an array `a` of `n` integers.
- There are `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l` and `r`.
- For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` within the range `[l, r]` such that `a[i] != a[j]`, or report `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

#### Provided Function Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
   (t,) = R()
   ```
   - This reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Main Loop:**
   ```python
   while t:
       t -= 1
       (*_, k) = R()
   ```
   - Decrement `t` and read the length of the array `k`.

3. **Reading Array Elements:**
   ```python
   a = {*R()}
   b = {*R()}
   ```
   - Here, `a` and `b` are sets containing elements from the array. However, this logic seems incorrect because the problem requires reading the entire array and processing queries on subarrays.

4. **Processing Queries:**
   ```python
   f = 1
   m = n = k // 2
   for i in range(1, k + 1):
       u = i in a
       v = i in b
       f &= u | v
       m -= u & ~v
       n -= ~u & v
   ```
   - This loop seems to be trying to check conditions but is fundamentally flawed. It doesn't correctly handle the logic required for the problem.

5. **Output:**
   ```python
   print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
   ```
   - This prints a string based on the conditions `f`, `m`, and `n`, which do not align with the problem requirements.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Reading the Array:** The function reads the array as sets `a` and `b`, which is incorrect. The array should be read as a list.
- **Processing Queries:** The function attempts to process queries using sets `a` and `b`, which are not correctly initialized and do not represent the subarray elements.
- **Output Logic:** The output logic is based on conditions that do not match the problem requirements. It uses bitwise operations and string slicing, which are not relevant to finding pairs of different elements.

### Corrected Version:
The function needs to:
1. Read the entire array.
2. Process each query to find a pair of different elements within the specified range.
3. Print the result for each query accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n, q = R()
        a = list(R())
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = R()
            subarray = a[l-1:r]
            distinct_elements = set(subarray)
            
            if len(distinct_elements) > 1:
                for i in range(len(subarray)):
                    for j in range(i + 1, len(subarray)):
                        if subarray[i] != subarray[j]:
                            print(i + l, j + l)
                            break
                    else:
                        continue
                    break
                else:
                    print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(-1, -1)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading the Array:** The array `a` is read as a list.
2. **Processing Queries:** For each query, the subarray `subarray` is extracted from `a` using the given range `[l-1, r)`.
3. **Finding Distinct Elements:** A set `distinct_elements` is used to find unique elements in the subarray.
4. **Finding Different Pairs:** If there are more than one distinct elements, the function searches for a pair `(i, j)` such that `subarray[i] != subarray[j]`. If found, it prints the indices adjusted by `l-1` to account for the original array indexing. If no such pair is found, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It incorrectly processes the input and does not properly handle the queries to find pairs of different elements within the specified range.

#### Correctness:
**False**

The function needs to:
1. Read the entire array.
2. Process each query to find a pair of different elements within the specified range.
3. Print the result for each query accordingly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
