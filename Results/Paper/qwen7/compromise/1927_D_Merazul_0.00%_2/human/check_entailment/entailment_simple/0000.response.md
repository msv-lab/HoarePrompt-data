Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The code reads the input in a way that does not match the problem statement. Specifically, it reads `*_, k = R()`, which suggests it is trying to read the number of queries (`q`) from the input, but it does not properly handle the subsequent reading of the array `a` and the queries.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Different Elements**: The code attempts to use sets `a` and `b` to check if there are any elements in the range `[l, r]` that are unique within this range. However, the logic used to populate these sets and the conditions to check for the existence of different elements is flawed. It seems to be checking for the presence of `k` in sets `a` and `b`, which are not defined according to the problem requirements.

3. **Incorrect Output Format**: The code prints 'YNEOS' based on some conditions, which does not match the required output format. The output should consist of pairs of indices or `-1 -1` for each query.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
