Output State: **`i` is equal to `k`, `f` is `1`, `m` is `k // 2`, `n` is `k // 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a new set containing elements from the function `R()`, `b` is a new set containing elements from the function `R()`**.

Explanation: The code `m = n = k // 2` assigns the value of `k // 2` to both `m` and `n`. The other variables (`i`, `f`, `t`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
