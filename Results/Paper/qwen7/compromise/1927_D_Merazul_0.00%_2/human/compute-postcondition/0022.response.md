Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is the second element returned by `R()`, `u` is True if 3 is in `a` else False, `v` is False, `f` is True, `m` is `m - 1`, `n` is `n + 1`**.

This means that the value of `u` is now determined by whether `3` is present in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
