Output State: **`t` is 0, `k` is the second element returned by R(), `a` is a set containing the first element returned by R(), `b` is a set containing the elements returned by R().**

Explanation: The code `b = {*R()}` creates a set `b` by unpacking the tuple returned by `R()` into the set constructor. Since `R()` returns a tuple, let's denote the first element of `R()` as `first_element` and the second element as `second_element`. Therefore, `b` will contain these two elements. The values of `t`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
