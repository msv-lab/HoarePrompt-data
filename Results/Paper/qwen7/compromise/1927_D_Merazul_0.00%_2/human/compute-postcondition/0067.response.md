Output State: **`u` is a boolean indicating whether `i` is in list `a`, `v` is a boolean indicating whether `i` is in list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `v = i in b` checks if the variable `i` is present in the list `b` and assigns the result (True or False) to the variable `v`. The initial state of `u` remains unchanged as it indicates whether `i` is in list `a`. The value of `i` and the content of list `a` remain unchanged as well.
