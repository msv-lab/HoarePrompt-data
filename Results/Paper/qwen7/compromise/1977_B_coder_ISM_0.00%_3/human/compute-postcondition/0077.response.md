Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 29, the characters at indices 0 to 28 of string `s` are all set to '0', and the character at index 29 of string `s` is '1'; length is 29.**

The code `length += 1` increments the value of `length` by 1. Given that `length` was initially not specified, we assume it started at 0 (as no other initialization is provided). After executing the code, `length` becomes 1 (initial value) + 1 = 29. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
