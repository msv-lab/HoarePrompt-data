Output State: **`i` is 0, `30` is 30, and the bitwise AND of `x` and 2 raised to the power of `i` is true; '1' is appended to the list `s`.**

The code `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since no list `s` was mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is a new list being initialized. The values of `i` and `30` remain unchanged, and the condition involving `x` and the bitwise AND operation also remains true.
