Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `length`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `for i in range(1, length)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `length`.

3. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `flag` is 0
   - `i` is 3
   - `length` is 29
   - Additional postcondition: If `s[3]` is '-1' and `s[2]` is '1', then no changes are made to the variables.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `length`. Given `length` is 29, `i` must be incremented to 4 for the next iteration.
   - The value of `length` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body based on the given information.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 4.
   - `length` remains 29.
   - `flag` remains 0 as there is no indication that it should change based on the loop execution.
   - The additional postcondition remains the same since it does not depend on the loop variable `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 4, `length` is 29**.
