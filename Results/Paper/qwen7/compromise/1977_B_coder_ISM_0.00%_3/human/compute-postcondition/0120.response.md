Output State: **`i` is 2, `30` is 30, `s` is a list containing '0'**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s.append('0')` appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` is a list, and since the condition `x` and \(2^2\) being non-zero does not affect the list `s` directly (as `s` is only appended to), the list `s` changes from potentially containing `'1'` to now containing `'0'`. The values of `i` and `30` remain unchanged.
