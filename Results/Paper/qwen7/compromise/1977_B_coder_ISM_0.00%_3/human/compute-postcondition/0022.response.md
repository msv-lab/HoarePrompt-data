Output State: After the loop executes all 30 iterations, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. Each element in `s` is '1' if the bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^i\) (where \(i\) ranges from 0 to 29) is greater than 0, or '0' otherwise.

This means `s` will contain '1' for each bit position in the binary representation of `x` where there is a 1, and '0' for each position where there is a 0. The list `s` will thus represent the binary form of `x` in reverse order (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit).
