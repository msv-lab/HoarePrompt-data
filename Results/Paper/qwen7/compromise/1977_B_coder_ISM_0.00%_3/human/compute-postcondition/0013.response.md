Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, and `s` is a list containing '1'.**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially empty (implied by the condition given), after appending `'1'`, `s` now contains `'1'`. The values of `i` and `length` remain unchanged.
