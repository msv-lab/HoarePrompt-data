Output State: **`i` is 29, `30` is 30, `s` is a list of length 30 with each element being either '1' or '0' based on the binary representation of `x`, and `flag` is 0.**

The variable `flag` is initialized to 0, which does not affect the values of `i`, `30`, or `s`. Therefore, these values remain unchanged from their initial state.
