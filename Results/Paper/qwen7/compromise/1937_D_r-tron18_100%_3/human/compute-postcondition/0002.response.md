Output State: **`totalOne` is `len(pre)`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i+1 is the position index (1-indexed) of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of accumulated sums starting from 0.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `preOne` using the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module, which accumulates the values in `pre` starting from an initial value of 0. This means that `preOne` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to each index, including the initial value of 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
