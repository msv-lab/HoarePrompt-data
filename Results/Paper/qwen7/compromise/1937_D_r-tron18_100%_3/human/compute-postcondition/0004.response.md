Output State: **`totalOne` is `len(pre)`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i+1 is the position index (1-indexed) of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of accumulated sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is `[0]`, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The line `ans = [0] * n` creates a list `ans` of length `n` filled with zeros. This does not affect the values of `totalOne`, `s1`, `pre`, `preOne`, or `suffZero`.
