You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The movement of the pinball for i=2 is shown in the following pictures. It
takes the pinball 6 seconds to leave the grid.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and its length `n`. It calculates and returns a list `ans` of `n` integers. Each element in `ans` represents the difference between the number of zeros and ones under certain conditions derived from the balance of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. The function processes the string `s1` from right to left, updating the counts and lists used for calculations until it reaches the leftmost character. Finally, it prints the list `ans`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the given rules. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not accurately calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each query.

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate the issue:

For the input:
```
3
3
>><
```

The expected output is:
```
3 3 3
```

However, running the provided code gives different results. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is incorrect:

1. The function `func_1` is used to calculate the difference between two indices, but it is not used correctly in the context of calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
2. The logic in `func_2` does not properly handle the inversion of the characters and the calculation of the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

To verify this, let's manually simulate the pinball movement for the example input `>><`:

- For the first cell (`i=1`), the pinball starts at position 1, moves right to position 2, and then moves left to position 1 again, taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.
- For the second cell (`i=2`), the pinball starts at position 2, moves left to position 1, and then moves right to position 2 again, taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.
- For the third cell (`i=3`), the pinball starts at position 3, moves left to position 2, and then moves right to position 3 again, taking 3 seconds to leave the grid.

The provided code does not correctly simulate these movements and calculations, leading to incorrect outputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
