Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell, given the direction of movement ('<' or '>') at each cell. The key is to correctly simulate the movement and inversion of directions until the pinball leaves the grid.

2. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` processes the string `s1` and calculates the time for each cell.
   - It uses prefix sums (`preOne`) and suffix sums (`suffZero`) to efficiently compute the required differences.
   - The logic inside the loop correctly handles the transitions of the pinball's position and the changes in direction.

3. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` calculates the difference between elements in a list based on the index determined by `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - This function seems to be used to get the correct position of the pinball based on the accumulated movements and the current time.

4. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The overall approach in `func_2` correctly simulates the pinball's movement and computes the time to exit the grid for each starting cell.
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums allows efficient computation without recalculating the entire sequence for each cell.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like when the pinball reaches the boundary of the grid and stops moving.
   - The logic for updating `preOne` and `suffZero` ensures that the calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.

Correctness: **True**
