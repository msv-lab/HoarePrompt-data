Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly computes the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each position `i` in the string `s1`.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The pinball moves based on the direction (`<` or `>`) at each cell.
   - The direction at each cell is toggled after each move.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The function initializes two lists: `pre` and `suffZero`.
     - `pre` stores positions where the direction is `'>` and is incremented by 1.
     - `suffZero` stores cumulative sums of positions where the direction is `'<`.
   - It then iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each position.
   - For each position `i`:
     - If the direction is `'>`:
       - It calculates the number of `'>` and `'<` up to the current position.
       - It uses these counts to compute the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - If the direction is `'<`:
       - It similarly calculates the time using the counts of `'>` and `'<`.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the toggling of directions and the calculation of the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The use of `accumulate` and the list operations ensure that the cumulative counts are correctly maintained.
   - The final printed list `ans` should contain the correct times for each position.

Given the detailed analysis and the structure of the code, the implementation in `func_2` appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
