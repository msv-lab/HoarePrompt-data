Output State: **`operational_list` is a non-empty list containing the split elements of the input string; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string representation of the first element in `operational_list`; `rev_res` is equal to `rev_res` plus `x_rev`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `rev_res = rev_res + x` adds the value of `x` (which is `x_rev`) to `rev_res`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `rev_res`, it remains as `rev_res` plus the value of `x_rev`. All other variables remain in their initial state.
