Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings split from the input and must have at least one element; `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`; `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reverse of the string `x` to the list `rev_val`. Since `x[::-1]` reverses the string `x`, the list `rev_val` now contains this reversed string. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
