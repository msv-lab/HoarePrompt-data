Output State: **All elements in `operational_list` have been processed, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is different from the original, and `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is the same as the original.**

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The `operational_list` will be empty since all its elements have been processed.
- The `rev_val` list will contain the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` where reversing changes the length of the string.
- The `rev_res` string will contain all elements from `operational_list` where reversing does not change the length of the string.
