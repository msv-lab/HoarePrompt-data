Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list (after reversing it and converting to integer), `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation: The code reverses the string `x`, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to `x_rev`. The original list `operational_list` and the original string `x` remain unchanged except that `x` is now used to compute `x_rev`.
