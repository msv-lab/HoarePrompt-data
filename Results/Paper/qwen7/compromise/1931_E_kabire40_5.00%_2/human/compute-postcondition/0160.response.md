Postcondition: `rev_res` is a string constructed based on the elements of `rev_val` according to the given conditions. Specifically, for each index `x` in `rev_val` (where `x` starts from 0 and goes up to the length of `rev_val` minus 1), if `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated by appending the reverse of the string at index `x` in `rev_val`. Additionally, the value of `10 ** int(max_power)` is greater than or equal to `int(rev_res)`.
