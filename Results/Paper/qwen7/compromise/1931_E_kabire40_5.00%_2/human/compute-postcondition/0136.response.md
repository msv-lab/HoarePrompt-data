Output State: **`rev_val` must have at least 1 element, x is an integer, and the remainder of x divided by 2 is equal to 0; `val_in` is the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val` to the variable `val_in`. Since `x` is an integer and the remainder of `x` divided by 2 is 0, `x` is even. The value of `rev_val` remains unchanged, and the value of `x` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the only new information is that `val_in` holds the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`.
