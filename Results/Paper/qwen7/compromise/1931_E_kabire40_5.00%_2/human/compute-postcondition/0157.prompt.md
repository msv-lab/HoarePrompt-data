Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `operational_list` has been processed, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is different from the original, and `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string is the same as the original.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is an integer, and `rev_res` is constructed as follows: if `x` is even, `rev_res` is the string concatenation of `rev_res` and the string representation of the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus the reverse of the element from `rev_val` at index `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is equal to `k + 1`. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is the concatenation of `rev_res` with the string representation of `val_in`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is constructed as specified plus the reverse of the element from `rev_val` at index `x`, and `val_in` is the element from `rev_val` at index `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is `k + 2`. If `x % 2 == 0`, then `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is an integer from `rev_val[x]`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus the reverse of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the element at index `k + 2` in `rev_val`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
