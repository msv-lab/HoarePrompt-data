Postcondition: `operational_list` contains at least one element; `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of `x` is equal to the length of the reversed string of `x`, then `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.
