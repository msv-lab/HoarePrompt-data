Output State: **`rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is `k + 2`, `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus the string representation of `val_in`, `val_in` is an integer from `rev_val[x]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `val_in` to `rev_res`. Since `val_in` is an integer from `rev_val[x]` and `x` is `k + 2`, the value of `rev_res` is updated by adding the string form of `val_in` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
