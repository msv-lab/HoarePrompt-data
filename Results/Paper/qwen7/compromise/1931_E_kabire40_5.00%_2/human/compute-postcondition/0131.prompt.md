Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `operational_list` is a list created from the split input, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of 10 that fits into the input string.
Code of the loop:
for x in operational_list:
    x_rev = int(x[::-1])
    if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
        rev_res = rev_res + x
    else:
        rev_val.append(x[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `operational_list` contains at least one element, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`. If `len(str(x_rev))` equals `len(x)`, then `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `operational_list` contains at least one fewer element, `x` is no longer defined. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is equal to `rev_res` plus the integer representation of the reversed string of the last value of `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` now includes the reverse of the last value of `x`, and `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the last value of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `operational_list` must contain at least two fewer elements, `x` is undefined. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `x_rev` remains unchanged (i.e., `x_rev` is 0). Otherwise, `x_rev` contains the reversed string of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
