Postcondition: `rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is an integer, and `rev_res` is a string. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated by appending the string representation of the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated by appending the reverse of the element from `rev_val` at index `x`.
