Output State: **`rev_val` must have at least 1 element, `x` is equal to `k + 1`, `rev_res` is constructed as specified plus the reverse of the element from `rev_val` at index `x`, and `val_in` is the element from `rev_val` at index `x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res += val_in[::-1]` appends the reversed version of `val_in` (which is the element from `rev_val` at index `x`) to `rev_res`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
