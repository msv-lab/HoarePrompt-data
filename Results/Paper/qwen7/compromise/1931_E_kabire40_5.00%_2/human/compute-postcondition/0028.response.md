Output State: **`x` is 0, `rev_val` contains at least one element, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[0]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of the element at index `x` (which is `0`) in the list `rev_val` to the variable `val_in`. Since `x` was initially `0` and the condition `x % 2 == 0` was satisfied, `x` remains unchanged. The value of `rev_val` and its elements remain the same, but now `val_in` holds the integer value of the first element in `rev_val`.
