Output State: All elements from `operational_list` have been processed, meaning `operational_list` is now an empty list. For each element `x` in the original `operational_list`, if the length of the reversed integer `x_rev` (which is the integer value of the reverse of `x`) is equal to the length of `x`, then `x` has been added to `rev_res`. Otherwise, `x_rev` has been appended to `rev_val`. `rev_res` contains a concatenated string of all such `x` values, and `rev_val` is a list of all `x_rev` values where the lengths did not match.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `operational_list` will be empty, `rev_res` will contain a string made up of all numbers from `operational_list` whose reversed form has the same length as the original number, and `rev_val` will be a list of all other reversed numbers.
