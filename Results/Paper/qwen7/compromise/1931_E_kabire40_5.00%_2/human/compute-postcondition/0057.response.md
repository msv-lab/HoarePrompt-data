Output State: **`x` is equal to the total number of elements in `rev_val` - 1, `rev_res` is an empty string, `rev_val` is now an empty list, the value of \(10^{int(max_power)}\) will either be less than or greater than or equal to `int(rev_res)`, and `y` is equal to `int(input())`.**

Explanation: The line `rev_res = ''` initializes `rev_res` as an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
