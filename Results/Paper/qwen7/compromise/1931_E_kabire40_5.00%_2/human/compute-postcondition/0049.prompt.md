Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `operational_list` is empty, `rev_val` contains the reverse of each element in the original `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string does not match the original string's length, sorted in ascending order, and `rev_res` is a string that contains the sum (concatenated as strings) of all elements from the original `operational_list` whose reversed length matches the original length.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `x` is either 0 or 1, `rev_val` contains at least one element, and `rev_res` is constructed as follows: if `x` is 0, `rev_res` is the string representation of `val_in` appended to `rev_res`; if `x` is 1, `rev_res` is `rev_res` concatenated with the reversed string of `val_in`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `x` is 1, `rev_val` contains at least one element, and `rev_res` is updated as follows: if `x` is even, `rev_res` is the previous value of `rev_res` plus the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is an integer equal to the reversed string of `rev_val[1]`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is the original `rev_res` plus the reverse of `rev_val[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `x` is 2, `rev_res` is updated as the previous value of `rev_res` plus either the string representation of the integer value of the reversed string of `rev_val[1]` (if `x` is even) or the integer value of the reverse of `rev_val[1]` (if `x` is 2). `rev_val` contains at least one element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
