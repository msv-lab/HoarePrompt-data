Based on the initial state provided:

- `rev_res` is a string constructed by appending the string representation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]` for even indices `x` and the reverse of the string at odd indices `x`.
- `max_power` is an integer.
- The current value of `rev_res` satisfies the condition that `10 < len(rev_res) <= 100`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Sasha')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Sasha'`. Since no other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Sasha**
