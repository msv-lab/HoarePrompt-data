Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `x` and the iterable `rev_val`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `x`**: Since the loop starts with `x` being 0 (as per the `range(len(rev_val))`), `x` should be set to 0 initially.

3. **Determine the state of `rev_val`**: The loop will iterate over each element in `rev_val`. Therefore, `rev_val` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Other variables**: The variables `operational_list`, `rev_res`, and the loop body itself (`# the loop body is omit`) do not affect the loop's execution directly. They are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `x` should be 0.
- `rev_val` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`x` is 0, `rev_val` must contain at least one element**
