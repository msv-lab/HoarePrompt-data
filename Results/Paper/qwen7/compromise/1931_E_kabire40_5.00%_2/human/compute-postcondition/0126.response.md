Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `x` and the list `operational_list`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `operational_list` contains at least one element.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `operational_list` contains at least one fewer element.
   - `x` is no longer defined after processing the last element.
   - If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is updated accordingly.
   - Otherwise, `rev_val` includes the reverse of the last value of `x`, and `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the last value of `x`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `x` is no longer defined after processing the last element, it cannot be used in the next iteration.
   - `operational_list` must contain at least one more element for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `operational_list` must contain at least one more element, and `x` is undefined.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`operational_list` must contain at least two fewer elements, `x` is undefined**.
