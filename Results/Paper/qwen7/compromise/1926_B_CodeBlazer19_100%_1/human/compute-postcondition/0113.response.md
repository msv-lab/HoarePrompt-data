Output: **TRIANGLE**

Explanation: According to the initial state, the variable `a` is explicitly defined as 'TRIANGLE'. Since no operations are performed on `a` before the print statement, the value of `a` remains 'TRIANGLE'. Therefore, when the print statement `print(a)` is executed, it will print the string 'TRIANGLE'.
