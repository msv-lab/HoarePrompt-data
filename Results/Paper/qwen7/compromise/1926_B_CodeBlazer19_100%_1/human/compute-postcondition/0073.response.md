Output State: **Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is 3 (since the loop runs from `j` in range(n), and if the loop ran 3 times, `j` would be 2 at the last iteration, so it will be 3 after the loop completes), `s` is the final input string from the user, and if the input string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` remains 'TRIANGLE'; if `s` does not contain more than one '1', the conditions for `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` remains greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is 3 (indicating the loop has completed its iterations), and `s` is the final input string provided by the user. The value of `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' only if the last input string `s` contained exactly one '1'; otherwise, `a` retains its previous value.
