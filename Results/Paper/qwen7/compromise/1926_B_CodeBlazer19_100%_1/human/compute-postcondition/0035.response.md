Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to the value of `n`, where `n` is the input integer.
- `a` is either 'TRIANGLE'.
- `b` is 'SQUARE'.
- `s` is the final input string after all iterations.
- The current value of `a` is not 0.

The `print(a)` statement will print the value of `a`.

Since the current value of `a` is explicitly stated to be either 'TRIANGLE' and it is also mentioned that `a` is not 0, the value of `a` is 'TRIANGLE'.

Output: **TRIANGLE**
