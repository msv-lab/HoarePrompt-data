Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for j in range(n):` statement. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Conditions**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or remains 0.
   - `b` is either 'SQUARE' or becomes 'SQUARE'.
   - `s` is the input string.
   - The count of '1' in `s` is either exactly 1 or greater than 1.

3. **Check the Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is 0, `j` starts from 0 in the first iteration. After the first iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `j` should be 1 and `n` must remain greater than 1.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `a` remains either 'TRIANGLE' or 0.
   - `b` remains 'SQUARE'.
   - `s` remains the input string.
   - The count of '1' in `s` remains either exactly 1 or greater than 1.

Given these points, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or remains 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `s` is the input string, and the count of '1' in `s` is either exactly 1 or greater than 1.**
