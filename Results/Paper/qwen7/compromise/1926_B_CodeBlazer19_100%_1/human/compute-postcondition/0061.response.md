Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is 1, `s` is the input string from the user. If the input string `s` contains more than one '1', the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of the variables.
