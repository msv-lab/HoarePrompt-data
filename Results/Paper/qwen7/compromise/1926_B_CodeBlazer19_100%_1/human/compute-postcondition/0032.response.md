Output State: **Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to the value of `n`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or remains 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', and `s` is the final input string after all iterations.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs `n` times. The variable `t` remains greater than 0 as it was initially and no operation within the loop changes it. The variable `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if any input string `s` had exactly one '1', otherwise it remains 0. The variable `b` will be 'SQUARE' because the loop condition does not change its value once it is set to 'SQUARE'. The variable `s` will hold the last input string provided during the loop's execution.
