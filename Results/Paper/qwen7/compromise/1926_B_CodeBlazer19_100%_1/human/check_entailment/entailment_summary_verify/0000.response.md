### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided program:

1. **Triangle Identification**:
   - The program checks if any row has exactly one '1'. This is insufficient because a triangle can have multiple rows with exactly one '1'. For example, a triangle with \( k = 3 \) would have rows like "010", "011", "010". The program would incorrectly identify such a triangle as a square.

2. **Square Identification**:
   - The program checks if any row has more than one '1'. This is also insufficient because rows with more than one '1' do not necessarily form a square. For instance, a grid with rows "0110", "0110", "0110" would be identified as a square, but it does not meet the criteria for a square (all '1's must be equidistant from the left edge).

3. **General Logic**:
   - The program does not check the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square. It only relies on the count of '1's in each row, which is not enough to determine the shape accurately.

Given these issues, the program fails to correctly identify the shapes in many cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect based on the provided problem description and the function summary.
