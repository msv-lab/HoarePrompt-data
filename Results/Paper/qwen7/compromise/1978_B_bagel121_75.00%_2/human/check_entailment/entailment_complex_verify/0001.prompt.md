You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

    #State: Output State: The total cost calculated for each test case based on the given conditions, printed for each iteration of the loop. If the usual price of a bun (a) is greater than or equal to the modified price of the first bun (b), the total cost is simply the usual price multiplied by the number of buns (n). Otherwise, the total cost is calculated using the formula involving the modified price, the difference between the usual and modified prices, and the number of buns.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \), representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. For each test case, it calculates the total cost of selling \( n \) buns, considering the modified price for the first bun and the usual price for the rest. If the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to the modified price \( b \), the total cost is simply \( n \times a \). Otherwise, it uses a specific formula to compute the total cost, taking into account the modified price, the difference between the usual and modified prices, and the number of buns. The function prints the total cost for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit Bob can make by selling \( n \) buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is \( a \) coins.
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \)).
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price, which is \( b - i + 1 \) coins for the \( i \)-th bun.
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It checks if \( a \ge b \). If true, it prints \( n \times a \) because selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - Otherwise, it calculates \( k \) as \( \min(b - a + 1, n) \).
     - This ensures \( k \) is within the valid range.
   - It calculates the profit from the first \( k \) buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 
     \[
     \text{Profit from first } k \text{ buns} = \frac{k}{2} \times (b + (b - k + 1))
     \]
   - It calculates the profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - Finally, it adds these two profits and prints the result.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic for calculating the profit from the first \( k \) buns is correct.
   - The condition \( a \ge b \) correctly handles the scenario where selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - The calculation of \( k \) and the subsequent profit calculation are logically sound.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
