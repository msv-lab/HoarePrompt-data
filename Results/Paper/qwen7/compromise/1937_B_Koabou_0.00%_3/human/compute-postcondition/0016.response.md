Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings `a_{1}` and `a_{2}` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the comparison of these binary strings for each test case.**

Note: The actual logic and processing of the binary strings are not described here as per the instruction to only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
