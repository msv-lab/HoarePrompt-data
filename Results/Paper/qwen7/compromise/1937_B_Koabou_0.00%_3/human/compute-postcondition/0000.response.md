Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `a` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, and the binary strings `a_{11} a_{12} … a_{1n}` and `a_{21} a_{22} … a_{2n}` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` retains its value as a positive integer within the specified range, and `a` is now an empty list.
