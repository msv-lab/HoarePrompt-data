Output State: **`num` is the third element of `N`, `cur` is equal to `num`, and `M[cur]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Since `cur` is initially equal to `num`, which is the third element of `N`, `M[cur]` (which is `M[num]`) is increased by 1. The values of `num` and `cur` remain unchanged.
