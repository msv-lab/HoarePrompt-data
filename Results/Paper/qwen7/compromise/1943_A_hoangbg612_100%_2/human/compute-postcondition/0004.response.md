Output State: **`T` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\) and \(T > 0\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers.**

Explanation: The code `N.sort()` sorts the list `N` in ascending order. The values of `T` and `S` remain unchanged. Therefore, `T` is still an input integer within the specified range, `S` is still an input integer, and `N` is now a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
