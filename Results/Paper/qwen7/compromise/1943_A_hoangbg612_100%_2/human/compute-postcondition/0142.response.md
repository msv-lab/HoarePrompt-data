Output State: **`num` is assigned to `cur`, `N` must contain at least one element, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is updated to be equal to `num`. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement remains the same, i.e., if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. The list `N` and its first element property are unchanged.
