Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than `cur`, `cur` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. This means that `cur` now holds the same value as `num`. The condition that `num` is an integer greater than `cur` remains valid only if the original value of `num` was indeed greater than the original value of `cur`. After the assignment, the relationship between `num` and `cur` changes to `cur` being equal to `num`. The other preconditions remain unchanged.
