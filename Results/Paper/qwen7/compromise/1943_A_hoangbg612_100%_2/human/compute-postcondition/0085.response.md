Output State: **`cur` is increased by 1, `num` is the next value from `N`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `cur` is increased by 1 and `num` is set to the next value from `N`. The values of `cur` and `num` are updated before the `break` statement is executed, and the `M` variable remains unchanged from its previous state.
