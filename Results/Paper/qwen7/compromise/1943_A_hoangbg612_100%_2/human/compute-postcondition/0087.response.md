Postcondition: `num` is the next value from `N`, `cur` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If the condition `num > cur + 1` is not met, the postcondition remains as the initial state where `num` is the next value from `N` and `cur` and `M` remain as they were updated in the previous iteration.
