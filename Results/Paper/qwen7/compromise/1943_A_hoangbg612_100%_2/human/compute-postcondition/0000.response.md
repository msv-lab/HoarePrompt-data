Output State: **T is an input integer, 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), and the code does not change the value of `t` but renames it to `T`, the new state retains the same constraints on `T`. All other variables remain unchanged and still satisfy their initial conditions.
