Postcondition: **`k` is the third key in the dictionary `M`, and `cnt` is a list containing the second key of `M`. If `M[k]` equals 1, `cnt` is appended with the current key `k`.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block. It states that at the start of the next iteration, `k` is the third key in the dictionary `M`, and `cnt` remains unchanged unless `M[k]` equals 1, in which case `cnt` is appended with the current key `k`.
