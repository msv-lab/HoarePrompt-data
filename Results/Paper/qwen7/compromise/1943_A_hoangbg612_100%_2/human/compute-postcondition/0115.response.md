Output State: **`k` is the second key in the dictionary `M`; `cnt` is a list with the second key of `M` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k` (which is the second key in the dictionary `M`) to the list `cnt`. Since `k` was the second key in the dictionary `M` before the code execution, it remains the second key after the code execution. The list `cnt` now contains the second key of `M`.
