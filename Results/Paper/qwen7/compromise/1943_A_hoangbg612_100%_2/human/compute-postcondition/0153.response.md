Output State: **`num` is the second element of `N`, `cur` is equal to `num`, and since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition if the if condition is not met.**

This means that the value of `cur` has been updated to be equal to `num`, while `num` remains the second element of `N`. The conditions specified in the postcondition remain unchanged unless the if condition was met, which did not happen in this case.
