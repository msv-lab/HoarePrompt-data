Output State: **`num` is the first element of `N`, `N` must contain at least one element, and `cur` is an index such that `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The initial conditions for `num` and `N` remain unchanged, and `cur` is an index that was used to access an element in the list `M`. Since `num` is the first element of `N` and is less than or equal to `cur`, these conditions still hold true after the code execution.
