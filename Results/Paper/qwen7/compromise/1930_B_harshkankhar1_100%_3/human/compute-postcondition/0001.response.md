Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list where every second element starting from the first (index 0) is reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses every second element in the list `a`, starting from the first element (index 0). This means that the elements at indices 0, 2, 4, etc., are swapped with their corresponding elements in reverse order. All other elements in the list remain unchanged.
