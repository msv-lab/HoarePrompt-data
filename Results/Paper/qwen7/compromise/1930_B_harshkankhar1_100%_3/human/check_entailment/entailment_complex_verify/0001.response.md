### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - Inside the loop for each test case, the function `func_1()` is called.
   - `func_1()` generates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then reverses every other element in the list starting from the first element (i.e., elements at even indices).
   - Finally, it prints the list `a`.

3. **Permutation Validity**:
   - Let's analyze the generated permutations:
     - For `n=4`, the permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]` is generated. We need to check if there are any pairs `(p_i, p_{i+1})` and `(p_j, p_{j+1})` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
       - Pairs to check: (4, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)
       - No pair satisfies the divisibility condition.
     - For `n=3`, the permutation `[1, 2, 3]` is generated. We need to check if there are any pairs `(p_i, p_{i+1})` and `(p_j, p_{j+1})` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
       - Pairs to check: (1, 2), (2, 3)
       - No pair satisfies the divisibility condition.
   - The permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]` and `[1, 2, 3]` are indeed valid according to the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, as it only processes up to `10^5` elements in total across all test cases.
   - The permutation generation logic ensures that the resulting permutation meets the required conditions for all valid `n`.

However, the original assessment did not fully consider the general validity of the approach. Specifically, while the provided examples are valid, the program's approach does not guarantee that the generated permutation will always meet the condition for all possible values of `n`.

### Detailed Analysis:
- The program generates a permutation by reversing every other element. This approach does not inherently ensure that no pair of consecutive elements `(p_i, p_{i+1})` and `(p_j, p_{j+1})` will satisfy the divisibility condition for all `n`.
- For certain values of `n`, particularly those with specific factor relationships among numbers, the generated permutation might still violate the condition.

### Conclusion:
While the provided examples are valid, the program's approach does not guarantee that the generated permutation will always meet the condition for all possible values of `n`. Therefore, the original assessment is overly optimistic and does not account for potential edge cases.

**Final: False**

The program is not guaranteed to produce a valid permutation for all possible values of `n`.
