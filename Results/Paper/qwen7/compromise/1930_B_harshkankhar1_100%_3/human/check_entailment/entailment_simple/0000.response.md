Reasoning:

1. The problem requires generating a permutation of length \( n \) such that no two pairs of consecutive elements satisfy the divisibility condition \( p_i \mid p_{i+1} \) and \( p_j \mid p_{j+1} \) for \( i \neq j \).
2. The provided solution generates a permutation by creating a list of integers from 1 to \( n \) and reversing every other element (starting with the second element).
3. Let's analyze the generated permutation:
   - If \( n \) is even, the permutation will look like: \( [1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, \ldots, \frac{n}{2}, \frac{n}{2}+1] \).
   - If \( n \) is odd, the permutation will look like: \( [1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, \ldots, \frac{n+1}{2}] \).
4. For any pair of consecutive elements \( (p_i, p_{i+1}) \) and \( (p_j, p_{j+1}) \), where \( i \neq j \):
   - \( p_i \) and \( p_{i+1} \) are either both even or both odd (since they are from different halves of the original sequence).
   - Similarly, \( p_j \) and \( p_{j+1} \) are either both even or both odd.
   - Since the elements are chosen from the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \), and the sequence is constructed by alternating between the first half and the reversed second half, no element can divide another element in the next pair because the elements are spread out in such a way that no divisibility condition can hold.
5. Therefore, the constructed permutation satisfies the problem's requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly generates a valid permutation for each test case.
