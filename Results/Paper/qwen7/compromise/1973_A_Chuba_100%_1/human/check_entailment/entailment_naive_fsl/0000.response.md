Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened. The logic in the program is flawed and does not account for the correct distribution of points for wins, losses, and draws.

For instance, consider the input `1 1 2`. According to the problem description, the scores `1, 1, 2` can be achieved through two games: one win for the third player and one draw for the first and second players. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1` for this case.

The program checks if the sum of the scores is even. If it is odd, it prints `-1`, which is correct. However, if the sum is even, it calculates the result using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`. This formula does not correctly handle the distribution of points for wins, losses, and draws.

A correct approach would involve checking the possible combinations of wins, losses, and draws that can lead to the given scores. The program needs to ensure that the scores can be achieved through a valid set of games and results, and if not, it should output `-1`.
