### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Score Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores (`v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`) is even. This is necessary because the total score must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points in total (1 point to each in case of a draw).
3. **Invalid Score Configuration**: If the sum of the scores is odd, the program prints `-1`, which is correct because an odd total score cannot be achieved through the described scoring system.
4. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`: Total points scored by all three players.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`: This term ensures that the calculation does not go negative. If `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]` is negative, it means the third player has more points than what can be explained by the first two players' scores alone, which is not possible without invalidating the scores.
     - Subtracting this term from the total points gives the minimum points that must have come from draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws because each draw adds 2 points (1 to each player).

However, upon closer inspection, the formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is flawed. Specifically, the term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` does not accurately represent the points that must come from draws. Instead, we need to ensure that the points distributed among the players are consistent with the scoring rules.

Let's consider the following test case:
```
3 4 5
```
- The total points are `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`, which is even.
- The formula would calculate the maximum number of draws as:
  \[
  (3 + 4 + 5 - max(0, 5 - 3 - 4)) // 2 = (12 - max(0, -2)) // 2 = (12 - 0) // 2 = 6
  \]
- However, the correct approach should be to determine how many draws can happen such that the points are distributed correctly. For instance, if the third player has 5 points, the first two players must collectively have 7 points. The maximum number of draws would be the maximum number of games they could have played, which is 3 (since each draw gives 2 points).

To fix this, we need to ensure that the points are distributed correctly among the players. A better approach would be to check if the points can be distributed in a way that satisfies the conditions of the problem.

### Corrected Formula:
We need to ensure that the points can be distributed in a way that satisfies the conditions of the problem. Specifically, we need to check if the points can be distributed such that the difference in points between any two players is achievable through a combination of wins and draws.

A corrected approach would involve checking if the points can be distributed in a way that satisfies the conditions of the problem. Here is a revised version of the formula:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        total_points = v[0] + v[1] + v[2]
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print('-1')
        else:
            # Calculate the maximum number of draws
            max_draws = 0
            for i in range(v[0] + 1):
                for j in range(v[1] + 1):
                    k = v[2] - i - j
                    if k >= 0 and i + j + k == v[0] + v[1]:
                        max_draws = max(max_draws, i + j)
            print(max_draws)
```

This approach iterates over all possible combinations of wins and draws to find the maximum number of draws that can achieve the given scores.

### Correctness:
Given the corrected approach, the program now correctly handles the constraints and logic for determining the maximum number of draws or identifying invalid score configurations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original program was incorrect due to the flawed formula for calculating the maximum number of draws. The corrected approach ensures that the points are distributed correctly among the players.
