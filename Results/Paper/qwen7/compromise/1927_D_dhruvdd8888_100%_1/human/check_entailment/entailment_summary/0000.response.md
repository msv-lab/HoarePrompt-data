Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.
3. It then constructs an array `arr` that records the positions where the value of `nums` changes.
4. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment in `arr` that corresponds to the query range `[l, r)`.
5. Based on the position of the segment found, it determines whether there are distinct elements within the query range and prints the appropriate indices or `(-1, -1)` if no such indices exist.

The logic seems to handle the problem requirements correctly. The program processes the input as specified and uses efficient methods like binary search to find the required segments.

Correctness: **True**
