### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding pairs of different elements within a specified subarray for multiple queries. If no such pair exists, the output should be `-1 -1`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`N`), the array itself, and the number of queries (`q`).
   - It then processes the array to identify segments where consecutive elements are the same.
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that covers the query range and then determines if there are different elements within that segment.

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - **Segment Identification**: The code correctly identifies segments where consecutive elements are the same.
   - **Query Processing**: The code uses binary search to find the relevant segment and checks if the segment boundaries cover the query range.
   - **Output Handling**: The code handles cases where no different elements are found within the query range.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element Segments**: The code correctly handles segments with only one element.
   - **No Different Elements**: The code correctly outputs `-1 -1` when no different elements are found.
   - **Boundary Conditions**: The code correctly handles boundary conditions for the query ranges.

5. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The approach of identifying segments and using binary search to find relevant segments is sound.
   - The handling of edge cases and boundary conditions appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the given code appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
