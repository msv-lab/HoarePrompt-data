Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` remains a list of n integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `q` remains an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of tuples, `N` remains an integer input from stdin, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `e` is 0, `num` is the last element of `nums`, `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the list `arr` and subtracts 1 from it, storing the result in the variable `LA`. The length of `arr` is stored in `LA`, but the actual list `arr` and its elements remain unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states.
