Output State: **`i` is 4, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, `k` is `-dif * 5`, `res` is -2, `ans` is `ans + (a[5] - a[4])`, `n` must be greater than 4**.

Explanation: The line `res -= 1` subtracts 1 from the current value of `res`. Given that the initial value of `res` is -1, after executing this line, `res` becomes -2. All other variables (`i`, `dif`, `k`, `ans`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
