You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of cards of each type initially possessed.
def func():
    ans_list = []
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        ans = a[0]
        
        res = n - 1
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            dif = a[i + 1] - a[i]
            if dif == 0:
                res -= 1
            if dif != 0:
                if k >= dif * (i + 1):
                    ans += dif
                    k -= dif * (i + 1)
                    res -= 1
                else:
                    ans += k // (i + 1)
                    if i != 0:
                        res += k % (i + 1)
                    k = 0
                    break
                if k == 0:
                    break
        
        if k != 0:
            ans += k // n
            res += k % n
        
        ans += (ans - 1) * (n - 1)
        
        ans += res
        
        ans_list.append(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will contain a list `ans_list` where each element is calculated based on the given logic within the loop. Specifically, for each iteration, the variable `ans` is updated according to the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a`, the value of `k`, and the size of the list `n`. After processing all elements in the input as specified by the loop, `ans_list` will contain the cumulative result of `ans` for each input set processed.
    #
    #To provide a more concrete example, let's assume we have processed `m` sets of inputs (where `m` is the total number of iterations the loop runs). For each set, the value of `ans` is updated based on the operations described in the loop, and then appended to `ans_list`. Therefore, `ans_list` will contain `m` elements, each representing the final value of `ans` for each respective input set.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state can be described as follows:
    #
    #Output State: `ans_list` is a list containing the final value of `ans` for each input set processed by the loop. Each element in `ans_list` represents the cumulative result after applying the specified operations on the input lists `a` for each set, with `k` and `n` being the key parameters influencing the final value of `ans`.
    for a in ans_list:
        print(a)
        
    #State: `ans_list` contains the final value of `ans` for each input set processed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, k, and a, where t is an integer between 1 and 100, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5, k is an integer between 0 and 10^12, and a is a list of n integers each between 1 and 10^12. It returns a result based on these inputs.
