Output State: **`i` is 8, `dif` is `a[9] - a[8]`, `res` is 5, `k` is `-dif * 9`, `ans` is `ans` + (`a[9] - a[8]`).**

Explanation: The code `k -= dif * (i + 1)` updates the value of `k`. Initially, `k` is 0, `dif` is `a[9] - a[8]`, and `i` is 8. The expression `dif * (i + 1)` calculates `dif * 9`. Since `k` is being subtracted by this value, `k` becomes `-dif * 9`. The values of `res` and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
