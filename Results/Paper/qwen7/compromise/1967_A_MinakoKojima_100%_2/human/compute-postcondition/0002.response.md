Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The `ans_list` remains unchanged and is still an empty list. The values of `n` and `k` are the integers entered by the user.
