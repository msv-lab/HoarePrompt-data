Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `a`. The variables `ans_list`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
