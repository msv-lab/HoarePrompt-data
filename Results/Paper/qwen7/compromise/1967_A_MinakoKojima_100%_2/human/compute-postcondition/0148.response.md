Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`
   - `k` is either `-dif * 5` or 0
   - `res` is either -2 or -1
   - `ans` is either `ans + (a[5] - a[4])` or `ans`
   - `n` must be greater than 4

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 5.
   - The value of `n` must remain the same because it is an external variable not modified within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 5
- `n` must still be greater than 4

The values of `dif`, `k`, `res`, and `ans` do not change based on the loop head alone, so they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 5, `n` must be greater than 4**
