Output State: **`i` is 7, `k` is not 0, `res` is -1, `ans` is ans + (-1), `ans_list` contains ans + (-1), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `i`, `k`, `res`, `ans`, `ans_list`, `n`, or `k`. The only change is that `a` is now sorted.
