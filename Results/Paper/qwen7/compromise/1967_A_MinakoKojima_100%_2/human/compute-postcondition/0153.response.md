Output State: **`i` is 5, `dif` is `a[6] - a[5]`, `res` is `res - 1` if `dif` equals 0, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, and `ans` is `ans + dif`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += dif` adds the value of `dif` to `ans`. The values of `i`, `dif`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The only change is that `ans` now holds the value of its previous value plus `dif`.
