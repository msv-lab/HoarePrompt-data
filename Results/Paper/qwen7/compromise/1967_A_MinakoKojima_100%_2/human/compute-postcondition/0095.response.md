Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is not 0, `res` is `k % n - 1`, `ans` is `a[0]`, `dif` is `a[5] - a[4]`, `ans_list` contains `[a[0]]`**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated to `n - 1`. Since `res` was initially defined as `k % n`, the new value of `res` becomes `k % n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
