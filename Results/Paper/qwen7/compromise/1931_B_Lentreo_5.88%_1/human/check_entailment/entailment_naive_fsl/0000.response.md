Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of differences between each element and the last element is zero to determine if the containers can be made equal. This approach is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of redistributing water to achieve equality.

For example, consider the test case:
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
The program would calculate the differences as follows:
- Difference for 4: 4 - 3 = 1
- Difference for 5: 5 - 3 = 2
- Difference for 2: 2 - 3 = -1
- Difference for 1: 1 - 3 = -2
- Difference for 3: 3 - 3 = 0

Sum of differences: 1 + 2 - 1 - 2 + 0 = 0

Based on the program's logic, it would print "YES", but this is incorrect because we cannot redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount of water. The average amount of water per container is (4 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3) / 5 = 3, but we cannot achieve this distribution through the allowed operations.

A correct solution would involve checking if the sum of the elements is divisible by `n` and then verifying if the average can be achieved by redistributing the water. The program fails to handle this properly.
