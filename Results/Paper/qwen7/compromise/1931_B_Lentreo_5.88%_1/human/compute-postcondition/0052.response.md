Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `curr` is the sum of all elements in `nums` except those that are 0, each adjusted by subtracting `last` from it, where `last` is the value of `curr` from the previous iteration, `t` must be decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `curr`, `nums`, `last`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
