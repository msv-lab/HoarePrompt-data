Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `curr` is the sum of \((i - last)\) for each non-zero `i` in `nums`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\), `last` is the last element of the original `nums` list, and `nums` is updated with integers from the input split into a list.**

Explanation: The code converts the input string into a list of integers using `map(int, input().strip().split())` and assigns it to the variable `nums`. This updates the list `nums` with the integers from the input. The other variables (`n`, `curr`, `t`, and `last`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
