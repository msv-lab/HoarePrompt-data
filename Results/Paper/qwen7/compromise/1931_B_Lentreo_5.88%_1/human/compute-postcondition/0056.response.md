Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in nums:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `i` will take the value of each element in `nums` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `nums` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `nums`.
   - The variable `i` will start with the first element of `nums` in the first iteration.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `nums` is a list of integers, and the loop will iterate over each element in `nums`, `nums` must have at least one element.
   - In the first iteration, `i` will be set to the first element of `nums`.

Given the above points, we need to adjust the states such that `nums` has at least one element and `i` is set to the first element of `nums`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`last` is the last element of `nums`, `n` is an input integer, `curr` is 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element of `nums`**
