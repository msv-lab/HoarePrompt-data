Output State: **`curr` is updated to `curr + (i - last)`, `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of `nums`, `t` is decreased by 1, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, the first element of `nums` (`i`) is not 0.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is updated by adding the difference between the current element `i` and the last element `last` of the list `nums`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
