Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `curr` will be the sum of all elements in `nums` except those that are 0, each adjusted by subtracting `last` from it, where `last` is the value of `curr` from the previous iteration.**

In simpler terms, `curr` will hold the cumulative sum of all non-zero elements in the `nums` list, adjusted by subtracting the value of `last` (which starts as the last element of the initial `nums` list and changes with each iteration) from each non-zero element.
