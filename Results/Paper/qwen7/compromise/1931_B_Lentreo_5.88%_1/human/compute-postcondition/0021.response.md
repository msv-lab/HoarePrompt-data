Based on the initial state provided:

- `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`.
- `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `last` is the last element of the original `nums` list.
- `nums` is an empty list after all iterations.
- The current value of `curr` is 0.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
