Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) but does not properly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 2`, `m = 2`

According to the problem description, we need to find pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

Let's manually check the pairs:
- For \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\), and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). Since \(2\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\): \(1 + 2 = 3\), and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2\). Since \(3\) is not a multiple of \(2\), this pair is not valid.
- For \(a = 2\), \(b = 1\): \(2 + 1 = 3\), and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). Since \(3\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\): \(2 + 2 = 4\), and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\). Since \(4\) is a multiple of \(4\), this pair is valid.

Thus, the valid pairs are (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2), which gives us 3 valid pairs.

However, the provided program calculates the number of valid pairs using a different logic that does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this input, making the correctness **False**.
