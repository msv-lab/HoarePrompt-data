Given the initial state, let's break down the variables and their values:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).

The key variable here is `ans`, which is defined as:
\[ \text{ans} = n + \sum_{i=2}^{\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor + 1} \left(\frac{n + i}{i^2}\right) \]

Here, the summation part involves iterating from \(i = 2\) to \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor + 1\) and computing \(\frac{n + i}{i^2}\) for each \(i\). 

The `print(ans)` statement will print the computed value of `ans`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot provide a precise numerical answer. However, we know the formula used to compute `ans`.

Output: **n + sum((n + i) / (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))**
