Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m` for each test case, ensuring the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.**

This means the function `func_1` indirectly processes a series of test cases, each containing three integers (`t`, `n`, and `m`). For each test case, it checks the conditions on `n` and `m` and returns a result accordingly, ensuring the overall constraints are met.
