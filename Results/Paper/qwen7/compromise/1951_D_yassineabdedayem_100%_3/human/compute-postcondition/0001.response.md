State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, and t is greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. The value of `t` is obtained from user input using `int(input())`, and it is specified that this input is an integer between 1 and 1000.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be within the range of 1 to 1000 and must be greater than 0.

Thus, the state to be adjusted is that `t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, and `t` must be greater than 0.
