Reasoning:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the conditions and logic used to determine if Bob can set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly \(k\) jewels are flawed.

1. **Case \(n = k\):**
   - The program correctly outputs 'YES' and 1 and 1, which means only one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. However, this is only a special case and does not cover all scenarios where \(n = k\).

2. **Case \(n + 2 > 2k\):**
   - The condition \(n + 2 > 2k\) is too restrictive. It should be \(n + 2 > k \cdot 2\), but even this is not sufficient to ensure that Alice buys exactly \(k\) jewels. For example, if \(n = 5\) and \(k = 3\), \(n + 2 = 7\) is indeed greater than \(2k = 6\), but setting up two stalls with prices 3 and 1 would not necessarily make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels (she might buy more or fewer depending on the exact values).

3. **General Case:**
   - The general case where the program outputs 'NO' is also problematic. The program does not provide a way to set up stalls to achieve exactly \(k\) jewels in all other cases. The logic needs to be more flexible to handle different values of \(n\) and \(k\).

To correctly solve the problem, Bob needs to set up stalls such that the cumulative sum of the number of jewels Alice buys from each stall equals \(k\). The program should consider more complex strategies for setting stall prices and the number of stalls.

Correctness: **False**
