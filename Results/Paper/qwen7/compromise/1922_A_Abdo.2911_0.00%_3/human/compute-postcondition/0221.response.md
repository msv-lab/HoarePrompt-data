Postcondition: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` remains False, and `i` is either `i + 1` or 0. If `c[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, the values of `match_a_b`, `match_c`, and `i` remain unchanged.
