Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is False, `i` equals `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, the current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` in lowercase**

Explanation: The variable `match_c` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
