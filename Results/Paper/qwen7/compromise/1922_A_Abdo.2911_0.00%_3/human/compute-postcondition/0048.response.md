Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either lowercase or not lowercase; if the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `template` or the character at index `i` in `b` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `template`, `match_a_b` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
