Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting value for the `range` function).
   - `n` is an integer that defines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Analyze the given state before the loop**:
   - `template`: All characters are either unchanged or converted to uppercase.
   - `match_a_b`: True (this variable is not used in the loop head, so no adjustment needed).
   - `match_c`: True (this variable is not used in the loop head, so no adjustment needed).

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` set to 0, this is already correct.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`, so `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it is already set to 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
