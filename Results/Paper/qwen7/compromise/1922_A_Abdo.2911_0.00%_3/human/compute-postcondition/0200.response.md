Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `match_a_b` is either `True` or `False`.
   - `match_c` is `False`.
   - `i` equals `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase letter if and only if the character at index `i` in `c` (converted to lowercase) matches the current value of `template[i]` (also converted to lowercase). If they do not match, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, no change occurs to the variables.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Current State:**
   - Since `i` equals `n`, it means the loop has already completed all iterations up to `n-1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `0` and the loop condition must be checked again.
   - Given that `i` equals `n` and `n` is greater than 0, the next logical step would be to set `i` to `0` and check if the loop condition is met.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` needs to be set to `0`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to run but does not change within the loop itself.
   - `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop directly.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**.
