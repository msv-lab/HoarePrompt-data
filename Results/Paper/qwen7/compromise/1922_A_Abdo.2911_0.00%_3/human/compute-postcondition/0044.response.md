Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either lowercase or not lowercase. If the character is lowercase, then either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character is not lowercase, then if `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, we break out of the loop. Otherwise, the loop continues without changing the values of `i`, `n`, and `template[i]`.
