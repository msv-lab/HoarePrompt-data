Output State: **`template` has appended the value of `a[i]`, `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `a[i]` is equal to the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `template`. The conditions that `n` must be greater than 0 and the equality of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged.
