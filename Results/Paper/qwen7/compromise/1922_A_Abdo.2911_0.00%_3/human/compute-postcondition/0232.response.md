Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` remains False, `i` equals `n`, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is the stripped input string from user, `b` is the stripped input string from user.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `b`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
