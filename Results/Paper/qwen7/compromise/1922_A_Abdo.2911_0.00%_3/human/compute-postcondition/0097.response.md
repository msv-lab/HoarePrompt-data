Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. After executing the if-else block, `match_c` is either True or False. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` remains False. If `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `match_c` remains False.
