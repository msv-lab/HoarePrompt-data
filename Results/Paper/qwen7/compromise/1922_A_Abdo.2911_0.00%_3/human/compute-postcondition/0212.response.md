Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is False, and `i` is either `i + 1` or 0**

Explanation: The code sets `match_c` to `False`. This does not affect the values of `match_a_b` or `i`. Therefore, `match_a_b` remains either `True` or `False`, `match_c` is now explicitly `False`, and `i` remains either `i + 1` or `0`.
