Postcondition: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is False, `i` equals `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter. If the character at index `i` in `c` (converted to lowercase) matches the character at the same index in `template` (also converted to lowercase), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.
