Postcondition: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` remains False, and `i` is either incremented by 1 or reset to 0. If `template[i].islower()` is true and `c[i] != template[i]`, `i` is set to the next index where the condition is not met or breaks out of the loop. If the condition `c[i] != template[i]` is false, `i` is still incremented by 1. If the else part is executed, `i` is reset to 0, and if `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, no changes are made to the variables.
