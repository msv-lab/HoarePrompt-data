Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `match_c` remains False after the if-else block executes. If `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, then `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1, and `match_c` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `match_c` remains False.
