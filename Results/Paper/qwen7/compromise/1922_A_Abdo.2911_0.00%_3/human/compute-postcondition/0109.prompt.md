Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `match_a_b` remains unchanged, and `match_c` is `True`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `match_c` is either False (if the character at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the character at the same index in `template`), or `match_c` is True (if the current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` after converting both to lowercase).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. After executing the if-else block, `match_c` is either True or False. If `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_c` remains False. If `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, `match_c` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `match_c` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1. If `c[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, then `match_c` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, `match_c` remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
