Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `match_a_b` remains unchanged, and `match_c` is `True`.**

The code `match_c = True` sets the variable `match_c` to `True`. Since `i` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 0 from the initial state, these conditions remain unchanged. `match_a_b` also remains unchanged.
