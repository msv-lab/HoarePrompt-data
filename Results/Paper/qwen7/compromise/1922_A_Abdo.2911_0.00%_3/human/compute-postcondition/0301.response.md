Output State: **`match_c` is False, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `i` is being incremented and checked against the conditions provided. The values of `match_c`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
