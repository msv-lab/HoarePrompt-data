Postcondition: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is False, `i` equals `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `template[i]` is checked against these conditions: if `template[i]` is a lowercase letter, and does not match the corresponding lowercase letter in `c`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, or if it matches the corresponding lowercase letter in `c`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. In both cases, no other changes occur to the variables.
