Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is not lowercase. The current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` after converting both to lowercase; `match_c` is False.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `match_c`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `template`, or `c`. The precondition remains the same, and `match_c` is now explicitly set to `False`.
