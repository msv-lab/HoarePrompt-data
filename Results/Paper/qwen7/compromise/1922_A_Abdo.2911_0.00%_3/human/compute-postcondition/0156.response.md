Postcondition: `match_a_b` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, and the first element of `template` is not a lowercase letter. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, the match status remains unchanged; otherwise, `match_a_b` becomes False.
