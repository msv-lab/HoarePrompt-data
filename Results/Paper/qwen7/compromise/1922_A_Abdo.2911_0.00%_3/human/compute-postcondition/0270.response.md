Postcondition: `template` is a list of characters, `i` is an index within the list, and `match_a_b` is a boolean. If the character at index `i` in `template` is a lowercase letter and does not match `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or their lowercase versions), then `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If the character at index `i` in `template` is not a lowercase letter, and neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` (when converted to lowercase) matches the lowercase version of `template[i]`, the condition and break statement do not change.
