Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is False, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `match_c` to `False`. This does not affect the values of `match_a_b`, `i`, or the condition that `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, these variables and conditions remain unchanged.
