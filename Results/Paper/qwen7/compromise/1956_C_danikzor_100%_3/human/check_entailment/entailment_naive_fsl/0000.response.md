Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. According to the problem description, the goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the \(n \times n\) matrix using no more than \(2n\) operations. The program attempts to achieve this by performing type 1 and type 2 operations, but the logic for generating permutations is flawed.

Specifically, the program prints the same permutation for both type 1 and type 2 operations, which means it sets the entire row and column to the same values repeatedly. This approach does not necessarily lead to the maximum possible sum, as it does not consider the optimal permutation for each row and column independently.

For example, consider a \(2 \times 2\) matrix. The correct approach would be to set the first row to \([1, 2]\) and the first column to \([1, 2]\), resulting in a matrix with elements \(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}\), giving a sum of 9. However, the program's approach will result in a different permutation being applied to both rows and columns, which may not yield the maximum sum.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
