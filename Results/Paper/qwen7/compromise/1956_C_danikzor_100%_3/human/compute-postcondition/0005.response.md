Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case involves two integers: t and n. For each test case, t is an integer within the range 1 to 500, and n is an integer within the range 1 to 500. Additionally, the sum of n² across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵. The function processes these test cases and returns a result based on the given constraints.**

This means the function `func_1` is designed to handle a series of test cases, each containing two integers `t` and `n` with specified ranges, and it ensures that the cumulative value of `n²` across all test cases does not exceed a certain threshold. The exact nature of the return value (what it computes or outputs) is not specified here, only the constraints on the input parameters and their relationships.
