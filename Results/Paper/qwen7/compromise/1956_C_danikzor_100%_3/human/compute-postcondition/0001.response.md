Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an input integer.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
```

Let's break down the expression being printed:

1. **First part of the print statement**: `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`
   - This is a mathematical formula involving the variable `n`.
   - It calculates a specific value based on `n`.

2. **Second part of the print statement**: `2 * n`
   - This simply doubles the value of `n`.

Given that `n` is an input integer, we need to express the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)**
