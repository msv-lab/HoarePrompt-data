Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The key issues are:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Validation**: The solution checks if `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` can be made equal by splitting `arr[i-1]` into its digits and comparing the resulting list with its sorted version. However, this check is insufficient because it doesn't ensure that the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**: The solution only checks one pair `(i-1, i)` at a time and doesn't consider the overall transformation of the array. It also doesn't correctly simulate the operation of splitting and reinserting digits.

3. **Missing Transformation Logic**: The solution does not actually perform the digit-splitting operation and update the array accordingly. Instead, it just checks if the condition holds for one pair, which is not sufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted.

A correct approach would involve simulating the digit-splitting operation and ensuring that after each operation, the array remains in a state where it can potentially be sorted. This requires a more complex algorithm that keeps track of the possible transformations and checks if the array can eventually be sorted.
