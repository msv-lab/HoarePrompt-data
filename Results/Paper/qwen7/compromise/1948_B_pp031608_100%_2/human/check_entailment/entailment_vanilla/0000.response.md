Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `m` and the array itself.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`, assuming initially that the array can be sorted.
   - It splits the input array into individual integers and stores them in `arr`.

3. **Checking Array Order:**
   - The program iterates from the end of the array to the beginning (`m - 1` to `0`).
   - For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element (`arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`).

4. **Digit Splitting and Sorting Check:**
   - If the current element is less than the previous element, it converts the previous element to a list of its digits.
   - It appends the current element to this list of digits.
   - It checks if the combined list of digits is sorted.
   - If not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints "NO" if `ans` is `False`, indicating the array cannot be sorted.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", indicating the array can be sorted.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Sorted Condition:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if the combined list of digits is not sorted, the array cannot be sorted. This is not always true.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 34]`. If we split `12` into `[1, 2]` and append `34`, we get `[1, 2, 34]`, which is not sorted. However, if we split `34` into `[3, 4]` and append `12`, we get `[12, 3, 4]`, which is not sorted either. But if we split `34` into `[3, 4]` and append `12`, we get `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is sorted.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Digits:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits. It only checks if the combined list is sorted but does not actually perform the necessary operations to sort the array.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
