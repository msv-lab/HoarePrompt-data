Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is either equal to `arr[i - 1]` (if `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`), or `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` and `nums` is a list containing the digits of the new `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `nums` is updated to include the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by the digits of `arr[i]`, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code converts `arr[i - 1]` to a list of its digits and appends the digits of `arr[i]` to it. The values of `m`, `i`, `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` remain unchanged unless `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, in which case `arr[i - 1]` is replaced by `arr[i]` and then converted to a list of digits. The list `nums` is updated accordingly, and since no condition changes `ans`, it remains unchanged.
