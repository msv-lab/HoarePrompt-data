Postcondition: `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the new value of `arr[i]`, and if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is set to `False`. If `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` remains unchanged.
