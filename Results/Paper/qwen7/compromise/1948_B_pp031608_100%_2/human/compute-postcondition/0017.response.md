Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `m-1` to `1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `m-1` and decreases by 1 until it reaches `1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `m-1`.
   - `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`.
   - `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[i-1]` concatenated with `nums[0]`.
   - `nums` is a list containing these digits.
   - If `nums` is not sorted, then `ans` is `False`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i - 1` (which was `m-1` before, so now it becomes `m-2`).
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be `m-2`.
   - `arr[i - 1]` will be `arr[(m-2) - 1] = arr[m-3]`.
   - `arr[i]` will be the last digit of `arr[i-1]` (which is `arr[m-3]`) concatenated with `nums[0]`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `m` remains greater than 1.
   - `i` is now `m-2`.
   - `arr[i - 1]` is `arr[m-3]`.
   - `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`.
   - `nums` remains the same.
   - `ans` remains unchanged unless `nums` is not sorted, but since no new information suggests `nums` is not sorted, `ans` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is `m-2`, `arr[i - 1]` is `arr[m-3]`, `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing these digits, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
