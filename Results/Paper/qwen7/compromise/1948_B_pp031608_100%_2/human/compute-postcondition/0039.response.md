Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `arr[0]` is the result after all iterations where each element `arr[i]` (for `i` from `m-1` down to 1) has been checked against `arr[i-1]` and possibly updated to ensure it is not less than `arr[i-1]` unless it causes the digits when concatenated to be unsorted, in which case `ans` is set to `False`. If no such condition was met throughout all iterations, `ans` remains `True`.**
