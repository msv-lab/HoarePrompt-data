Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is `m-2`, `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, and `ans` is `False` if `nums` is not sorted, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be `nums[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `arr[i - 1]` being set to `nums[0]`, while all other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
