Postcondition: `m` is greater than 1, `i` is `m-2`, `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, and `ans` remains unchanged if `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` is set to `False`.
