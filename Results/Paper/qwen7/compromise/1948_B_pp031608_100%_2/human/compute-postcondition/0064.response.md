Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is updated to include the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digits of `arr[i]`, and `ans` remains unchanged if `nums` is sorted, otherwise `ans` is set to False.**

Explanation: The code converts `arr[i - 1]` to a list of its digits and appends the digits of `arr[i]` to `nums`. Since `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, the first digit of `nums` is the same as `arr[i - 1]`. After updating `nums`, we check if `nums` is sorted. If it is sorted, `ans` remains unchanged; otherwise, `ans` is set to False. However, since the problem does not specify the initial value of `ans`, we assume it remains unchanged unless `nums` is not sorted.
