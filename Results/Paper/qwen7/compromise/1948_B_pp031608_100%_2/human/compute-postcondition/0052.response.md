Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]` changes to `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the new `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and if the current state of `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False. If `nums` is already sorted, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `arr[i - 1]` is updated to be equal to `nums[0]`. Since `nums` was originally a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, updating `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]` means that `nums` now starts with the first digit of the new `arr[i - 1]`. The condition for `ans` remains the same unless `nums` is no longer sorted after this update.
