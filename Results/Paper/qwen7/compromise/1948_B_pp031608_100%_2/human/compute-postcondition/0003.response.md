Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `m` also remains unchanged as it was not used in the code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `arr` and retains the original values of `n` and `m`.
