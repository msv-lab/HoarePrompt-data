Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `m-1` down to `1` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `m-1` and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches `1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` is at least 2.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `arr[i]` is either equal to `arr[i - 1]` (if `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`), or `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` and `nums` is a list containing the digits of the new `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.
   - If the current state of `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False`. If `nums` is already sorted, `ans` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will stop because `i` will decrement to 0 in the next iteration, which is not within the range specified (`m-1` to `1`).
   - Therefore, no changes are needed for `i` as it will not change in the next iteration.
   - However, since the loop will not execute again, `m` remains the same.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `m` remains at least 2.
   - `i` remains 1 (since the loop will not execute again).
   - `arr[i]` remains as described (either equal to `arr[i - 1]` or `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` and `nums` contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`).
   - `nums` remains in its current state (not sorted or sorted based on the previous state of `ans`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration (which will not occur) remains the same as the current state.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is either equal to `arr[i - 1]` (if `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`), or `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` and `nums` is a list containing the digits of the new `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If the current state of `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False. If `nums` is already sorted, `ans` remains unchanged.**
