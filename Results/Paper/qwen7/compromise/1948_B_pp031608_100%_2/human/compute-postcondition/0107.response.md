Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digit of `arr[i]`, and `ans` is False.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. Since `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is actually `arr[-1]`. The value of `nums[0]` is the first element of the list `nums`, which is the last digit of `arr[i - 1]` (since `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[i - 1]`). The other variables remain unchanged.
