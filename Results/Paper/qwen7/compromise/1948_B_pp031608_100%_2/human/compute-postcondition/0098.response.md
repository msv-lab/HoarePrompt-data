Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the new value of `arr[i]`, and `ans` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `arr[i]`, `nums`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `arr[i - 1]` while keeping the rest of the conditions the same.
