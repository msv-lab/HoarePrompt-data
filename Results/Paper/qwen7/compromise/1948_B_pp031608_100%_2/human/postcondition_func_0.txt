The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and then reads `n` integers (each between 0 and 99). It checks if the sequence of these integers can be made non-decreasing by swapping adjacent digits within some of the integers. If any sequence cannot be made non-decreasing, the function prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES".
