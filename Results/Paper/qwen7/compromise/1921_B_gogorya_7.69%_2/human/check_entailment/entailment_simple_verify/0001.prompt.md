You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

    #State: Output State: After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `t`, `hd` will be `a1 - a2 - t`, `n` will be 0, `res` will be the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + t`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, and `t` is the initial input integer specifying the number of iterations.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will reflect the total number of iterations, which is `t`. The variable `hd` will be the difference between the count of '1's in `s1` and `s2` minus the total number of iterations, `t`. The variable `n` will be 0 because it is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. The variable `res` will hold the absolute value of the initial difference between the counts of '1's in `s1` and `s2` plus the total number of iterations, `t`. The counts of '1's in `s1` and `s2` are stored in `a1` and `a2`, respectively, and `t` remains unchanged as it was the initial input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, and the initial state `s1` and the desired state `s2`.

2. **Counting Cats:**
   - The program counts the number of cats in the initial state (`a1`) and the desired state (`a2`).
   - It calculates the difference `hd` between the number of cats in the initial state and the desired state.

3. **Adjusting for Initial Filled Boxes:**
   - If `hd` is positive, it means there are more cats in the initial state than in the desired state. The program sets `res` to the absolute value of `hd`, indicating that we need to remove cats to match the desired state.
   - If `hd` is negative, it means there are fewer cats in the initial state than in the desired state. The program sets `res` to the absolute value of `hd`, indicating that we need to add cats to match the desired state.

4. **Iterating Over Boxes:**
   - The program iterates over each box.
   - If there is a cat in the initial state but not in the desired state (`s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`), it increments `res` by 1. This accounts for moving a cat out of a box or removing a cat from a box.

5. **Outputting Result:**
   - The program prints the result `res`, which is the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state.
