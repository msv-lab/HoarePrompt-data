Output State: **`hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is 0, and `hd` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The variable `hd` is initially set to `a1 - a2`. After executing `hd -= 1`, `hd` is decremented by 1, resulting in `hd` being updated to `a1 - a2 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
