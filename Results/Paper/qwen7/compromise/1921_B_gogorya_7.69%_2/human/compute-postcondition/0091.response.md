Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1, and `res` is 1, assuming the condition `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'` is true. If the condition is false, `i` remains 0, `n` remains greater than 0, `hd` remains equal to its initial value minus 1, and `res` remains unchanged.
