Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is a string entered by the user, `a1` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s1`, `a2` is the number of occurrences of '1' in `s2`, `hd` is `a1 - a2`, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if hd > 0:
        hd -= 1
        continue
    if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
        res += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `res` is increased by 1 if `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`, and the condition `s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'` is checked whether `hd` is greater than 0 or not. If `hd` is greater than 0, the loop or iteration continues as before; if not, the condition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `res` is increased by 1 if `s1[i+1] == '1'` and `s2[i+1] == '0'`. The condition `s1[i+1] == '1' and s2[i+1] == '0'` is checked whether `hd` is greater than 0 or not. If `hd` is greater than 0, `hd` is decreased by 1 and the loop or iteration continues as before; if not, the condition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `res` is increased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1. If `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`, then `hd` is also decreased by 1 if `hd` > 0; otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
