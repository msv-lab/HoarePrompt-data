Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(n)` function.
   - The variable `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

5. **Consider Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `s1`, `s2`, `a1`, `a2`, `hd`, `res`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
