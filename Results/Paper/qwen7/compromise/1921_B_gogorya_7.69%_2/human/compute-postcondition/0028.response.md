The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. It does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop. Therefore, the values of `n`, `res`, `i`, `s1`, `s2`, and `hd` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `res` is increased by 1 if `s1[i+1] == '1'` and `s2[i+1] == '0'`, `i` is increased by 1, `hd` is decreased by 1 if `s1[i+1] == '1' and s2[i+1] == '0'` and `hd` > 0; `hd` is decreased by 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
