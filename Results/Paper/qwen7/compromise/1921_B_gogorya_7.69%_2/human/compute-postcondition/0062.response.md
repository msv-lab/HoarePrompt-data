Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Check if the loop should execute**:
   - Given that `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute if `n > 3`.

6. **Update the states**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

7. **Final state**:
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

Given the postconditions and the loop head, the relevant states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State: **`hd` is `a1 - a2 - 3` (or `a1 - a2 - 5` if `s1[2]` is '1' and `s2[2]` is '0'), `n` is greater than 0, `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2 + 2`, `a1` is the count of '1's in `s1`, `a2` is the count of '1's in `s2`, `i` is 4, and if `s1[3]` is '1' and `s2[3]` is '0', then `res` is increased by 1.**
