Output State: **`hd` is equal to its initial value minus 1 if it was greater than 0, and `res` is equal to `res` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. It does not affect the value of `hd`. Therefore, `hd` retains its initial value minus 1 if it was greater than 0, and `res` is now one more than its initial value.
