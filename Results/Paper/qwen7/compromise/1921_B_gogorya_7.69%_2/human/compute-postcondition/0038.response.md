Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `res` is the sum of all occurrences where `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'` for all valid `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `hd` is the difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2` at the end of the loop, and `t` must be greater than 0; `s2` is updated to the new string input.**

Explanation: The code updates `s2` to a new string input obtained from the user. All other variables (`n`, `res`, `hd`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
