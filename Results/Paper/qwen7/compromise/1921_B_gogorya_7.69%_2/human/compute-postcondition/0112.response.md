Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases through its description. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes three inputs: a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and two strings s and f of length n, where both strings consist of '0' and '1' characters. The function returns a result based on comparing the initial state string s with the desired state string f for each box represented by the length n.**

Note: The actual logic to compare and return the result is not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the operations inside the function.
