Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `hd` is greater than -1 and we continue the loop or iteration we were inside.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead moves to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the conditions and values of `n` and `hd` remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop it was in.
