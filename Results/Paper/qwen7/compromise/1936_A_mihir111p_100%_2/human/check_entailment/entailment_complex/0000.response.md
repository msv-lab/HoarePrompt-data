### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can query the relative values of \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\) using at most \(3n\) queries.

2. **Analyze the Given Code:**
   - The code iterates through indices to find potential candidates for maximizing \(p_i \oplus p_j\).
   - It uses a function `func_1` to perform the required bitwise operations and comparisons.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function performs a query and returns the result of the comparison.
   - It correctly prints the query in the form `? a b c d` and reads the response.

4. **Main Logic Analysis:**
   - The code initializes `ans1` to 0 and iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) to find a candidate index `ans1` that might maximize the XOR.
   - It then initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to [0] to store potential candidates.
   - For each index \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), it queries whether \((p_{mx} \mid p_{ans1})\) is less than \((p_i \mid p_{ans1})\).
     - If yes, it resets `v` and updates `mx` and `v`.
     - If equal, it appends \(i\) to `v`.
   - It then selects the best candidate from `v` by comparing with `ans1`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic to find the best candidate for maximizing XOR seems sound.
   - The number of queries is within the limit of \(3n\).
   - The approach ensures that we explore different combinations effectively.

### Conclusion:
The given code appears to follow the problem's requirements and constraints. It correctly implements the strategy to find the indices that maximize the XOR value using the allowed number of queries.

### Correctness:
**True**
