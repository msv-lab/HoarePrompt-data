Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly implement the strategy to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized. Here are the issues with the code:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The function `func_1` is used to perform the queries, but the logic inside the main loop is flawed. The variable `ans1` is updated incorrectly, and the logic for finding the maximum XOR pair is not implemented properly.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The code tries to find the maximum XOR by comparing the results of bitwise OR operations, but it does not correctly deduce the indices that maximize the XOR. Specifically, the logic for updating `mx` and `v` is incorrect and does not guarantee finding the optimal pair.

3. **Missing Strategy**: The approach to find the maximum XOR pair using at most \(3n\) queries is not correctly implemented. The current implementation does not follow a strategy that ensures the correct indices are found within the given constraints.

### Correct Approach:
A more effective way to solve this problem involves using a divide-and-conquer strategy to narrow down the potential candidates for the maximum XOR pair. Here's a high-level outline of a correct approach:

1. **Divide the Array**: Divide the array into two halves and recursively find the maximum XOR in each half.
2. **Merge the Results**: Merge the results from the two halves to find the maximum XOR across the entire array.
3. **Query Optimization**: Use the results of the queries to efficiently narrow down the potential candidates for the maximum XOR pair.

This approach ensures that the maximum XOR pair is found within the allowed number of queries.
