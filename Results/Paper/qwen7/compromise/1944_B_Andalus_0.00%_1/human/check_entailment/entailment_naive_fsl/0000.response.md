Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate two arrays `l` and `r` such that the bitwise XOR of their elements are equal. Specifically, the program only considers consecutive duplicates in the left half (`lft`) and the right half (`rgt`) of the input list and does not ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal. Here's a counterexample to demonstrate this:

Consider the input:
```
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

The expected output should include two arrays `l` and `r` such that the XOR of their elements are equal. However, the program might output something like:
```
1 2
3 4
```
or
```
2 3
1 4
```
But these outputs do not necessarily guarantee that the XOR of `l` and `r` will be equal. For instance, if the program outputs:
```
1 2
3 4
```
Then the XOR of `l` is `1 ^ 2 = 3` and the XOR of `r` is `3 ^ 4 = 7`, which are not equal.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
