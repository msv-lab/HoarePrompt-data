Postcondition: `sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a list containing unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to index `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 2 and less than or equal to the length of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing the element `rgt[2]`, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n`, and if the current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the previous value of `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` remains unchanged.
