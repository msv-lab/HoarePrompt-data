Output State: **`sz` is 5, `k` is 3, `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element, the first element in the list is `elem`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `sz`, `k`, or `sng`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no other operations are performed, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
