Postcondition: `sz` is either 0 or 2, `rdb` must contain at least one element, and `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part provided, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the if condition.
