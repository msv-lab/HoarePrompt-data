Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in rdb`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `rdb`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `rdb`. The loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop will continue until `rdb` is exhausted.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: The postcondition given is that `sz` is either 3 or 5, and `k` is 3. The loop will break if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: Since the loop is iterating over `rdb`, the only variable that can change within the loop is `elem`. However, the state of `rdb` itself (i.e., its length) can also change if the loop modifies it. But since no modifications to `rdb` are mentioned in the problem, we assume `rdb` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `rdb` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, `rdb` should not be empty.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sz` is either 3 or 5, `k` is 3, and `rdb` is not empty**
