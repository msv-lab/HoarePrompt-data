Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and the value of `rdb[-1]` is equal to the value of `rgt[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rgt[i]` to the list `rdb`. Given that `i` is 1 and the value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the value of `rgt[i - 1]`, which is `rgt[0]`, the value of `rdb[-1]` (the last element in `rdb`) will be equal to `rgt[0]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
