Output State: **sz is 5, k is 3, and rdb is empty.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `sz < k`. Given that `k` is 3, `sz` can only increase by 2 each time through the loop due to the condition `if k - sz >= 2:` which allows `sz` to increment by 2. After the loop executes 3 times, `sz` will be 5 because it starts at 3 and increases by 2 each iteration (3 + 2*3 = 9 operations, but since it checks before incrementing, it effectively adds 2 three times). The loop breaks when `sz` reaches 5 because `k - sz` is no longer >= 2 (3 - 5 < 2), and since `rdb` is not specified to change outside the loop, it remains unchanged from its initial state, implying it becomes empty as the loop progresses without further elements to process.
