Output State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is a list containing the element `lft[2]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n`, `i` is 2 and the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` (which is `lft[2]` since `i` is 2) to the list `ldb`. Since `lft[2]` is equal to `lft[1]`, `ldb` now contains this repeated value. All other variables remain unchanged.
