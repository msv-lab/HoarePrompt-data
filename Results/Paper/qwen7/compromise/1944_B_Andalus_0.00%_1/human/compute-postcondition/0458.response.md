Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is either 1 or 3.
- `rdb` remains empty, meaning it does not contain any elements.
- `sng` contains at least one element.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`.

However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `sng` contains at least one element, `elem` must be one of the elements in `sng`. But without knowing the exact value of `elem`, we can only describe it as an element from `sng`.

Given this information, the output will be:

Output: **an element from sng**
