Output State: `ldb` is empty, `rdb` is empty, `sz` is 12, `sng` contains at least 1 element.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `rdb` will be empty because it loses at least one element in each iteration until it is exhausted. The value of `sz` increases by 1 in each iteration as long as `sz` is less than `k`. Given that the loop executed 3 times, `sz` reaches 12. The loop breaks when `sz` becomes 12, meaning `k` must be at least 13 for the loop to run fully. Therefore, `ldb` remains empty as it was not involved in any operations within the loop. The condition `sng` must contain at least two elements initially ensures there are enough elements to iterate over, but after three iterations, it can contain at least one element.
