Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the value of `ldb` is a list containing the value of `lft[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `lft[i]` is equivalent to `lft[1]`. However, since the initial condition also states that `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `i - 1` is 0, `lft[i]` is actually `lft[0]`. Therefore, `ldb` now contains the value of `lft[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
