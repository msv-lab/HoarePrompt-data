Output State: **`sz` is 5, `k` is 3, and `rdb` is not empty.**

Explanation: The variable `sz` is incremented by 2, changing its value from either 3 or 5 (initially) to 5. The values of `k` and `rdb` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement as specified in the initial state.
