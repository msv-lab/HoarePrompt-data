Postcondition: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element, `sz` is equal to `k + 2`, `sng` must contain at least one element, `elem` is the second element of `sng`, and if `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the loop breaks, and the conditions specified in the if part apply. Otherwise, the conditions specified in the else part do not apply since there is no else part in this case.
