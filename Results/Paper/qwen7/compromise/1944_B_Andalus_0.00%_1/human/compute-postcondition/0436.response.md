Postcondition: `sz` is either 0 or 2. If `k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k - sz` is less than 2, the original conditions of `rdb` containing at least one element and `sz` being 2 or 4 still hold, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
