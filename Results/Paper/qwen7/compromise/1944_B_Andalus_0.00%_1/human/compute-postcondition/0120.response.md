Output State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` contains at least one element (excluding the one processed in the current iteration), `sz` is 5, `sng` must contain at least two elements and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `ldb`, `rdb`, `sz`, and `sng` remain unchanged from their initial states.
