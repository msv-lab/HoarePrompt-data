Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` contains at least one element.
- `sz` is `sz + 2`.
- If `sz` is greater than or equal to `k`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

However, the specific values of `elem` and `sz` are not explicitly stated. Since `ldb` contains at least one element, let's assume `elem` refers to the first element of `ldb`. Also, `sz` is incremented by 2, but without knowing the initial value of `sz` or `k`, we cannot determine if the loop or if statement is broken out.

Given this information, the print statement will print two instances of `elem` with a space in between. Since `elem` is the first element of `ldb`, and no other information about `elem` is provided, we will keep it as `elem`.

Output: **elem elem**
