Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` is empty.
- `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element.
- `sz` is equal to `k`.
- `sng` must contain at least one element.
- `k - sz` must be at least 2.

The print statement is `print(elem, end=' ')`. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state. Given the information provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `elem`.

Therefore, the output will include `elem` followed by a space, but since `elem` is not specified, we can only describe it as such.

Output: **elem**
