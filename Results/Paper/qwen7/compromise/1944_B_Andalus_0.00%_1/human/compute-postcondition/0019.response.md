Postcondition: `i` is an integer, `n` must be greater than 0, and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`. If `i` is less than `n - 1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `i` is incremented by 1, and `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[i]` from the previous state. If the condition `i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]` is not met, `i` remains unchanged.
