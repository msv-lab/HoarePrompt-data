Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `ldb` must contain at least one element.
- `k - sz` remains unchanged.
- If `sz` is increased by 2, then either the most internal loop or if statement is broken out, otherwise `sz` remains unchanged.

### Loop Head:
```python
for elem in ldb:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable in this case is `elem`, which iterates over each element in `ldb`.
2. **Other Variables**: The other variables mentioned are `ldb` and `sz`.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`ldb`**: Since the loop is iterating over elements in `ldb`, `ldb` itself does not change. It still contains at least one element.
- **`sz`**: The value of `sz` remains unchanged unless it is explicitly modified within the loop body. Based on the postcondition, `sz` will remain unchanged unless it is increased by 2, which would cause an exit from the loop or the most internal loop or if statement.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop is simply iterating over elements in `ldb` and does not modify `ldb` or `sz` directly (unless the loop body does something specific), the states of `ldb` and `sz` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final State:
- `ldb` must contain at least one element.
- `k - sz` remains unchanged.
- If `sz` is increased by 2, then either the most internal loop or if statement is broken out, otherwise `sz` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`ldb` must contain at least one element, `k - sz` remains unchanged, and if `sz` is increased by 2, then either the most internal loop or if statement is broken out, otherwise `sz` remains unchanged.**
