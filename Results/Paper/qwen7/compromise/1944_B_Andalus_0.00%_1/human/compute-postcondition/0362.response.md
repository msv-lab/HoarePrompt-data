Postcondition: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `sng` is a list containing unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to index `n-1`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` now contains the element `rgt[i]`, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n-1`.** 

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering that the `if` condition is met and `rdb` now contains the element `rgt[i]`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change if the `if` condition is not met.
