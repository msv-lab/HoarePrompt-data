Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sz` is 10
   - `k` is 3
   - `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[2]` if `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[1]`
   - `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to the length of `lst`
   - `lst` is a list of integers
   - `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end
   - `ldb` is an empty list
   - `rdb` is an empty list
   - `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n`
   - `i` is 2

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `sz` remains 10
   - `k` remains 3
   - `sng` remains the same (it is derived from `lft` and `lft[2]`)
   - `n` remains the same (it is derived from the length of `lst`)
   - `lst` remains the same
   - `rgt` remains the same
   - `ldb` remains the same
   - `rdb` remains the same
   - `lft` remains the same (it is derived from `lst` up to index `n`)
   - `i` is now 3

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a list containing the element `lft[2]` if `lft[2]` is not equal to `lft[1]`, `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to the length of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n`, and `i` is 3**
