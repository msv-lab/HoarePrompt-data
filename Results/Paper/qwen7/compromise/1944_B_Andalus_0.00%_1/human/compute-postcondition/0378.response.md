Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `ldb` contains at least one element.
   - If `k - sz >= 2`, then `sz` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, the original state of `ldb` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop iterates over each element in `ldb`:
   ```python
   for elem in ldb:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States**: Since the loop is iterating over each element in `ldb`, the only variables that can be adjusted based on the loop head are `elem` (the current element being processed) and `ldb` (the list from which elements are being taken).

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `ldb`.

5. **Post-Iteration State**: After processing one element from `ldb`, the list `ldb` will have one fewer element. The variable `elem` will hold the value of the element that was just processed.

6. **Condition Check**: The condition `k - sz >= 2` is checked at the start of each iteration. If this condition is true, `sz` is incremented by 2; otherwise, it remains unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
- `ldb` will have one fewer element than it had at the end of the previous iteration.
- `elem` will be the element that was just processed from `ldb`.
- The condition `k - sz >= 2` will be checked again, and if true, `sz` will be incremented by 2; otherwise, it will remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`ldb` contains at least one fewer element than before, `elem` is the element that was just processed from `ldb`, and `sz` is either incremented by 2 or remains unchanged depending on the condition `k - sz >= 2`.**
