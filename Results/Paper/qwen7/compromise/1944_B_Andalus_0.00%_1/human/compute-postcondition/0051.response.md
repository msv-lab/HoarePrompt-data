Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `rdb` will contain all elements from the list `rgt` starting from the second element, assuming each element in `rgt` is compared with its preceding element and found to be a duplicate. If any element in `rgt` is not a duplicate (i.e., it does not match the previous element), it will not be added to `rdb`.

In simpler terms, `rdb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from the list `rgt` starting from the second element, and `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop completes.
