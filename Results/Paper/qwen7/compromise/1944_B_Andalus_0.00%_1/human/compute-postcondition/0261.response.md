State: **`sz` is 3, `k` is 3, `rdb` is a non-empty iterable**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over each element in `rdb`.
2. For the loop to execute, `rdb` must contain at least one element because the loop will start from the first element and continue until all elements are processed.
3. The initial values of `sz` and `k` do not affect whether the loop can execute; they are not used in the loop head.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `rdb` must be a non-empty iterable to ensure the loop can execute.
