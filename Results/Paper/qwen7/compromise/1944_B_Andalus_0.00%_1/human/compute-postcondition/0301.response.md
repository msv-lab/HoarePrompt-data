Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is 6
- `k` is 3
- `sng` is a non-empty list with at least 1 element
- The first element in the list `sng` is the original `elem`

The print statement is `print(elem, end=' ')`.

Since the condition `sz >= k` is true (as `sz` is 6 and `k` is 3), the code will execute the print statement. The `elem` is the first element of the list `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the first element of the list sng)**
