Output State: **The loop will execute until `sz` reaches or exceeds `k`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times and `sz` is still 3, it implies that `k` is 3. Therefore, after all iterations, `sz` will be 3 and `k` will remain 3.**

The loop continues to increment `sz` by 1 with each iteration. Since `sz` is 3 after 3 iterations and `sz` needs to reach or exceed `k` to break the loop, and given that `sz` is already 3, no further iterations will occur. Thus, the final state will have `sz` as 3 and `k` as 3.
