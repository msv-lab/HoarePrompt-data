Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for elem in rdb:`. The objects involved here are `elem` and `rdb`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `rdb` contains all consecutive duplicate elements from `rgt` starting from the second element.
   - `elem` is the second element of `sng`.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `rdb`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `rdb` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `rdb` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `rdb` is not empty.
   - The value of `elem` is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition but will change with each iteration.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `rdb` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ldb` is empty, `rdb` must contain at least one element, `sz` is 3, `sng` must contain at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element of `sng`**.
