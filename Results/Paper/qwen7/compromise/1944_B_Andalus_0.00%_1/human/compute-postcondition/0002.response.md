Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ `T` â‰¤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `T` remains unchanged.
