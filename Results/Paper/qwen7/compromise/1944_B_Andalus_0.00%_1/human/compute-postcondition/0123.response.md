Based on the initial state provided:

- `ldb` is empty.
- `rdb` contains at least one element (excluding the one processed in the current iteration).
- `sz` is 5.
- `sng` must contain at least two elements.

The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print `elem` twice with a space as the separator. However, the value of `elem` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since `elem` is not mentioned in the initial state and no operation is performed on it within the given context, we cannot determine its value from the provided information.

Given the lack of explicit definition for `elem`, the best we can say is that `elem` is some value that would be determined in the context of the surrounding code, which is not provided here.

Output: **elem elem**
