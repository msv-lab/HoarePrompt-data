Output State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n`**.

Explanation: The code `rgt.sort()` sorts the list `rgt` in ascending order. Since `rgt` contains elements from the list `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, sorting `rgt` means that the elements in `rgt` are now in sorted order. The other variables remain unchanged.
