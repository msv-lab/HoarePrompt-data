Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `ldb` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `lft` starting from the second element, and `sng` will contain all elements from `lft` that are unique and not followed by another unique element in `lft`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i-1]`, the element `lft[i]` is added to `ldb`.
- If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i-1]` and `i < n-1` and `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i+1]`, the element `lft[i]` is added to `sng`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n`, meaning all elements in `lft` have been processed.
- `ldb` will contain all consecutive duplicates from the second element onwards.
- `sng` will contain all elements that are unique and not followed by another unique element in `lft`.
