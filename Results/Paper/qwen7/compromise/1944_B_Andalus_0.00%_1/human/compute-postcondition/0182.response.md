Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `1`, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` or `lft[i + 1]` (if applicable), and `sng` contains the value of `lft[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Since `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` or `lft[i + 1]` (if applicable), and `ldb` contains `[lft[i]]` if `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`, the condition for `ldb` does not apply here. Therefore, `sng` now includes the value of `lft[i]` appended to its existing contents. All other variables remain unchanged.
