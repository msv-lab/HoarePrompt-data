Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is 2
   - `rdb` is a list containing the values `[rgt[1], rgt[2]]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2 and the loop runs from 1 to `n`, the loop will stop at `i = 2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.

5. **Check Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n`.
   - With `i` being 3 and `n` being 2, the condition `i < n` becomes `3 < 2`, which is false.
   - Hence, the loop will not execute again.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
   - After the loop, `i` will be 3.
   - `n` and `rdb` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case is the end of the loop) is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 2, and `rdb` is a list containing the values `[rgt[1], rgt[2]]`**.
