Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `1`, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` or `lft[i + 1]` (if applicable), and `ldb` contains `[lft[i]]`, `ldb` is updated with `lft[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`. Since `lft[i]` was already part of `ldb` under the condition that `lft[i]` equals `lft[i - 1]`, appending it again does not change the fact that `ldb` contains `[lft[i]]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
