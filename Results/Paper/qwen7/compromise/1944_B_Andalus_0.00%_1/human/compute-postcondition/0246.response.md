Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for elem in sng`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `sng`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `sng`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `sz` is 1
   - `k` is defined (though `k` is not directly involved in the loop)

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `sz` is 1, it implies that `sng` contains exactly one element.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must contain at least two elements. This means that after processing the current element, `sng` should have at least one more element.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `sz` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `k` remains defined but is not directly involved in the loop's continuation.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`sz` is 2, `k` is defined**
