State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n`, `i` is 1**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (as specified in the range `range(1, n)`).
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` must be initialized to 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of `lst` to ensure the loop can run.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
