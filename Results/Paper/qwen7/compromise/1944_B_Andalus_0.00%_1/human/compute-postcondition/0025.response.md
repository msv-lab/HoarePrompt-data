Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, and `sng` contains `lft[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Given that `i` is 3, `lft[i]` is added to `sng`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition about `lft[i]` being either equal to or not equal to `lft[i - 1]` remains valid.
