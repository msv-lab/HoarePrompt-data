Output State: **`sz` is 10, `k` is 3, `sng` is a list containing unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to index `n-1`, `n` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to the length of `lst`, `lst` is a list of integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of integers containing the elements of `lst` starting from index `n` to the end, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted version of the list `lst` up to index `n`, and `i` is `n`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The variable `sng` will contain all the unique consecutive elements from the start of the sorted list `lft` up to but not including index `n`. This means if there are any repeated elements consecutively in the sorted list `lft` up to index `n-1`, they will not be included in `sng`. All other variables (`sz`, `k`, `lst`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `lft`) remain in their final states as they were not modified by the loop body.
