Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It first removes duplicate values from `arr` and sorts the resulting list in ascending order. If the smallest value in the sorted list is not 1, the function returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if there are any gaps greater than 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list. Based on this check and the alternating boolean value `A`, the function finally returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.**
