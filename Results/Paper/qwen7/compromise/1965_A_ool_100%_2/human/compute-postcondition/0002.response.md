Output State: **`set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `A` is False**

Explanation: The code `set_.sort()` sorts the list `set_` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the boolean variable `A`. The list `set_` now contains its unique elements sorted, while `A` remains unchanged.
