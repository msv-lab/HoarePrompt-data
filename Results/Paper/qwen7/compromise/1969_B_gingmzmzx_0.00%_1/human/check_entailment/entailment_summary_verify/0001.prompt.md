You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the occurrences of '0' in the string `s` and the presence of '1' before each '0'. Specifically, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each '0' that has at least one '1' preceding it, and by the difference between the total number of zeros and the count of '0's seen so far for each '1'. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated `ans` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to transform a binary string into a sorted (non-decreasing) order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring that is shifted.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It then counts the number of zeroes in the string.
   - Two counters `cnt` are initialized to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - The variable `ans` is used to accumulate the total cost.
   - A loop iterates through each character in the string `s`. For each character:
     - If the character is 0, it checks if there has been at least one 1 encountered (`cnt[1] > 0`). If so, it increments `ans`.
     - If the character is 1, it adds the number of remaining 0s (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic seems to be attempting to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string. However, the approach taken does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts required to achieve the sorted order.
   - The current logic does not account for the actual positions of 0s and 1s and how shifting them would affect the overall cost.
   - The logic incorrectly assumes that counting the number of 0s before a 1 and vice versa will give the correct minimum cost, which is not true for all cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: **False**
