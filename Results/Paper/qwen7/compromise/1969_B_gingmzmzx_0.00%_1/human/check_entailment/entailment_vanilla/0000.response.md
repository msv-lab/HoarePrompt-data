### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to transform a binary string into a sorted (non-decreasing) order using cyclic shifts of substrings. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring that is shifted.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It then counts the number of zeroes in the string.
   - Two counters `cnt` are initialized to keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - The variable `ans` is used to accumulate the total cost.
   - A loop iterates through each character in the string `s`. For each character:
     - If the character is 0, it checks if there has been at least one 1 encountered (`cnt[1] > 0`). If so, it increments `ans`.
     - If the character is 1, it adds the number of remaining 0s (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic seems to be attempting to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string. However, the approach taken does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts required to achieve the sorted order.
   - The current logic does not account for the actual positions of 0s and 1s and how shifting them would affect the overall cost.
   - The logic incorrectly assumes that counting the number of 0s before a 1 and vice versa will give the correct minimum cost, which is not true for all cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: **False**
