Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list (with the second element removed), `c` is the third character in the list `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is updated as follows: if `c` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0; otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `zeroes - cnt[0]`, where `zeroes` is the total number of zeroes in the list `s`. `cnt[c]` is the count of character `c` in list `s` plus one.
