Output State: **`cnt` is `[0, 0]`, `n` is `n - 1`, `s` is a list of integers (converted from input), `cnt[c]` for each character `c` in `s` contains the total count of that character in `s`, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in `s`, `ans` is 0**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `cnt`, `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, and `ans` remain as they were in the initial state, with `ans` being explicitly set to 0.
