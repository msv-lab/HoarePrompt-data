Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The precondition that `nabors` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are set to the respective integers from the input.
