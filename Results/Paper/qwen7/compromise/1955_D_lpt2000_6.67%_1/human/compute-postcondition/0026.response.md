Postcondition: **`D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is either one less than its original value and still greater than 0, or it is decreased by 1 to become less than or equal to 0, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 after the if-else block executes, and `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0**.
