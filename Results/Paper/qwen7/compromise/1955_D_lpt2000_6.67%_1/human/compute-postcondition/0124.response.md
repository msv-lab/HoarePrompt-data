Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `fnd` is either `fnd + 1` if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `tot` is the sum of `D.values()`, `aa[m:]` must contain at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must contain at least one element, `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is either equal to `D[in_aa]` + 1 or greater than `D[in_aa]` by 1, and `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: 
- `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.
- All other conditions and constraints remain the same as the initial state.
