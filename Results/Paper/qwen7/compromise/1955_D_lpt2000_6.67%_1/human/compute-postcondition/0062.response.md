Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; the values of `out_aa`, `in_aa`, `C[out_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, `C[in_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` remain unchanged.**

This means that the value of `D[out_aa]` has been decreased by 1. The conditions for `fnd` (whether it is incremented by 1 or remains unchanged) and the values of other variables (`out_aa`, `in_aa`, `C[out_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, `C[in_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]`) remain the same as they were in the initial state.
