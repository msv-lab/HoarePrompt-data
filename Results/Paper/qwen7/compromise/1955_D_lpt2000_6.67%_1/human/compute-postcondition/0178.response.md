Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must have at least 1 element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least 1 element, and based on the value of `D[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]`, the following conditions hold:
- If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0 and `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 while `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.
- If `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1, then no changes are made to `D[out_aa]`, `E[out_aa]`, and `C[out_aa]`.
