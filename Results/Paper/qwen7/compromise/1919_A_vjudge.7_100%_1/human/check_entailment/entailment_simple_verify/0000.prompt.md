You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of `test` lines, each line containing either 'Bob' or 'Alice' based on whether the sum of two integers (a and b) entered by the user is even or odd, respectively.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. According to the problem description, the game is won by the player who makes the last valid move. The program incorrectly determines the winner based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. This logic is flawed because the game's outcome depends on the parity of the individual values of `a` and `b`, not their sum.

For example, consider the case where `a = 1` and `b = 4`. According to the problem description, the game should be analyzed based on the parity of `a` and `b` individually. Here, `a` is odd and `b` is even. The correct analysis would be as follows:

- Alice starts with `a = 1` and `b = 4`.
- Alice can either swap or not swap. If she swaps, `a` becomes 4 and `b` becomes 1. Now, `a` is even and `b` is odd.
- Bob then has the choice to either swap or not swap. If he swaps, `a` becomes 1 and `b` becomes 4. Now, `a` is odd and `b` is even.
- This process continues until one player cannot make a valid move.

The program incorrectly prints "Bob" for this case, which is wrong based on the optimal strategy. The correct output should be "Alice" for this case, as Alice can force Bob into a losing position by always swapping when `a` is odd and not swapping when `a` is even, ensuring that Bob is eventually left with an empty wallet.

Therefore, the program does not handle the game logic correctly and is thus incorrect.
