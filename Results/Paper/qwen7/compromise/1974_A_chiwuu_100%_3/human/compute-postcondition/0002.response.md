Output State: `t` is the final value of `t` after all iterations of the loop have been executed, starting from the initial value of `t` and considering the operations performed within the loop for each iteration based on the values of `a` and `b`. The value of `n` determines the number of times the loop will run, and `n` is an input integer.
