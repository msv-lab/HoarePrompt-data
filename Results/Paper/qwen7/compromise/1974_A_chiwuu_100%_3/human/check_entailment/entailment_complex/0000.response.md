Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step to ensure it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required for placing the icons.

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Setup**: 
   - `t` is initialized to `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - The program then checks if `t` (number of 2x2 icons) is even or odd:
     - If even, `t` is halved (`t = t // 2`).
     - If odd, `t` is halved and incremented by 1 (`t = t // 2 + 1`).

3. **Adjustment Based on Remaining Space**:
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there is enough space to fit all 1x1 icons without needing additional screens. Hence, `t` remains unchanged.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, it means there is not enough space, and the program calculates how many more screens are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons. It does this by calculating `t2 = a - t1` and then determining how many full screens (`t2 // 15`) and possibly an additional screen (`t2 % 15 != 0` leads to an increment of 1) are needed.

4. **Final Calculation and Output**:
   - The final value of `t` is printed, which represents the minimum number of screens required.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. The calculations and conditions match the requirements stated in the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
