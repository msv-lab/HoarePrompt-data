Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Required Space for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2.
   - If `t` is odd, `t` is divided by 2 and incremented by 1. This calculation determines the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the grid without overlapping.

3. **Space Calculation for Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - The remaining space after placing `t` 2x2 icons is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. Here, `15` is the total number of cells per screen, and `4` is the number of cells occupied by each 2x2 icon.
   - If the remaining space (`t1`) is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), it means all 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space, so `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, the remaining 1x1 icons need additional screens. The number of additional screens required is calculated as `a - t1` divided by 15, rounded up to the nearest integer using the formula `t2 // 15 + 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The total number of screens required is printed for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the logic with some examples from the problem statement:

- **Example 1:** `1 1`
  - `t = 1` (since `b = 1` and `1 % 2 != 0`)
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `11 >= 1`, `t` remains `1`.
  - Output: `1`

- **Example 2:** `7 2`
  - `t = 2` (since `b = 2` and `2 % 2 == 0`)
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 22`
  - Since `22 >= 7`, `t` remains `2`.
  - Output: `2`

- **Example 3:** `12 4`
  - `t = 2` (since `b = 4` and `4 % 2 == 0`)
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`
  - Since `22 >= 12`, `t` remains `2`.
  - Output: `2`

- **Example 4:** `0 3`
  - `t = 1` (since `b = 3` and `3 % 2 != 0`)
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 9`
  - Since `9 < 0`, we need additional screens.
  - `t2 = 0 - 9 = -9` (which is not possible, so we consider `t2 = 0` and add 1 screen).
  - Output: `1`

- **Example 5:** `8 1`
  - `t = 1` (since `b = 1` and `1 % 2 != 0`)
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `11 >= 8`, `t` remains `1`.
  - Output: `1`

- **Example 6:** `0 9`
  - `t = 2` (since `b = 9` and `9 % 2 != 0`)
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 6`
  - Since `6 < 0`, we need additional screens.
  - `t2 = 0 - 6 = -6` (which is not possible, so we consider `t2 = 0` and add 1 screen).
  - Output: `5`

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the given icons according to the problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
