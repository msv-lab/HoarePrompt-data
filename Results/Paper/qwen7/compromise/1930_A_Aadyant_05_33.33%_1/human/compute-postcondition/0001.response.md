Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is the input received from the user, and `out` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `out`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `num`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 5000, and `num` remains the input received from the user.
