Output State: **`k` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `a` is the first line of input, `b` is a string input, `j` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `j` to 0. Since no other variables are modified, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
