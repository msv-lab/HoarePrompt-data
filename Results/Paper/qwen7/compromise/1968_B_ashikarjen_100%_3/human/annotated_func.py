#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and similarly, the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `k` is either 0 or greater than 0 depending on whether the condition `b[j] == a[i]` was met for any `i` in the range of `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the final value it was set to after the loop, `a` is the first line of input, `b` is a string input, and `j` is the final value it was set to after the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `k` will be incremented each time the character `a[i]` is found in the string `b` up to index `m-1`. If `a[i]` is found for any `i` in the range of `n`, `k` will be greater than 0; otherwise, it will remain 0. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The value of `n` and `m` will be the final values they were set to after the loop completes. The variables `a` and `b` will retain their input values, and `j` will be the final value it was set to after the loop exits.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is 0 if no characters from a are found in b within the specified range, and greater than 0 if at least one character from a is found in b)
    return
    #The program returns k which is either 0 or greater than 0 depending on whether the condition b[j] == a[i] was met for any i in the range of n, t which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n which is the final value it was set to after the loop, m which is the final value it was set to after the loop, a which retains its input value, b which retains its input value, and j which is the final value it was set to after the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two binary strings, `a` and `b`, of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It counts the number of times a character from string `a` is found in string `b` within the first `m` characters. The function returns the count (`k`), the original value of `t`, the final value of `n` after processing, the final value of `m` after processing, the original string `a`, the original string `b`, and the final value of `j` after processing. If no characters from `a` are found in `b`, `k` is 0; otherwise, `k` is greater than 0.
