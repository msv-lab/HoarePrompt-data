Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    if n == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        res = 0
        mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
        for i in range(mdx, n):
            if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                res += 1
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string. If `n` equals 1, then no changes are made to `mdx`, `i`, and `res`. Otherwise, `mdx` remains the same, `i` equals `n - 1`, and `res` is the count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, and `res` is the total count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`, where `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. If `n` is 1, `t` remains `t - 1`, `n` is 1, and `res` is 1 if `a[0]` equals `a[0]`, otherwise `res` is 0. If `n` is not 1, the loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n`. During each iteration, if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, `res` will increment by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string. If `n` equals 1, the values of `t`, `n`, and `mdx` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `mdx + n`, indicating the end of the list `a`. The variable `res` contains the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. The variables `n` and `mdx` retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
