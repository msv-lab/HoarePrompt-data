Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `res` is 0, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`**.

The code calculates `mdx` as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. Here, `n` is an input integer, so `mdx` will be calculated based on the integer value of `n`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
