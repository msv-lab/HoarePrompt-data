Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is initially greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This implies that `t` must be 1 (since the only number that is equal to itself minus 1 is 1). The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. No other variables are affected, so the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the precondition for `t`.
