Based on the initial state provided:

- `mdx` remains the same after all iterations.
- `i` equals `n - 1`.
- `res` is the count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which is the count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of elements from index mdx to n-1 that are equal to a[mdx])**
