Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `res` is the total count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues until `i` reaches `n`.
   - Inside the loop, if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, `res` increments by 1.
   - After all iterations, `t` is `t - 1` (though `t` is not defined in the initial state, it doesn't affect the calculation of `res`).

3. **Value of `mdx`:**
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - This means `mdx` is the middle index of the list `a` if `n` is odd, or the index just after the middle if `n` is even.

4. **Loop Condition and Increment:**
   - The loop runs from `i = n` down to `n` (which is essentially one iteration since `i` starts at `n` and the loop condition is `i < n`).
   - In this single iteration, `i` is `n`, so the condition `a[mdx] == a[i]` is checked.
   - Since `i` is `n` and `i` is always greater than `mdx` (because `mdx` is the middle index and `i` starts from `n`), the condition `a[mdx] == a[i]` will never be true.

5. **Final Value of `res`:**
   - Since the condition inside the loop is never met, `res` remains 0.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `res`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
