Postcondition: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from the input split by spaces, and `res` is the total count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`, where `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. If `n == 1`, then `res` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n`, and during each iteration, if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, `res` will increment by 1.
