Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string, and `res` is the total count of elements from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]` after all iterations.**

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be 0 because it starts as the input integer `t` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it becomes 0. The values of `n`, `a`, and `res` will reflect the state after the last iteration of the loop, where `n` is the integer input from the last test case, `a` is the sorted list of integers from the last input, and `res` is the count of elements from index `mdx` (which is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`) to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
