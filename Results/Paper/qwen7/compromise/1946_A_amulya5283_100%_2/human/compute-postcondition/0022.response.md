Output State: **`mdx` is the same as before, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `res` is incremented by 1, and `mdx + 1` must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by 1. The values of `mdx` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the condition that `mdx + 1` must be less than `n` still holds.
