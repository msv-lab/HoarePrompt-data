Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, and `res` is `res + 1`**.

In this case, the code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially unchanged from its previous state, it now holds the value of its previous state plus one. All other variables (`n`, `mdx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
