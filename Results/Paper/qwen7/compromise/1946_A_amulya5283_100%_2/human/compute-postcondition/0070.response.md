Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `mdx`.

2. **Understand the initial state**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `i` is initially set to `mdx + 1`.
   - `res` is incremented by 1 if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `i = mdx + 1` to `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `mdx + 1`.
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `mdx + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Check the condition**:
   - If `mdx + 2 < n`, the loop can continue.
   - If `mdx + 2 >= n`, the loop will terminate.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be `mdx + 2`.
   - `mdx` remains unchanged.
   - `res` remains unchanged unless the condition `a[mdx] == a[i]` is met, but since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we do not change `res` here.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, and `res` remains unchanged.**
