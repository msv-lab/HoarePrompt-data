Postcondition: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mdx + 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is 2, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, and if `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, then the value of `res` is set to 2. If `a[mdx]` does not equal `a[i]`, the value of `res` remains unchanged.
