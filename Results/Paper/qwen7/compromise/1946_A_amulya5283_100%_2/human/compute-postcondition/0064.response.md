Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `res` is `res + 1`**.

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was not initialized before this line, its initial value is considered to be 0. After executing this line, `res` becomes 1. The values of `n` and `mdx` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them.
