Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. The array `a` is sorted, which is necessary to find the median.
4. The program calculates the median index `mdx` correctly using the formula `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
5. However, the logic for counting the number of operations needed to increase the median is flawed. The program simply counts how many elements from the middle index to the end of the array are equal to the element at the middle index. This does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
6. To correctly solve the problem, we need to compare the middle element with the next largest element(s) and calculate the difference needed to make the middle element larger than these elements.

Given the above points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
