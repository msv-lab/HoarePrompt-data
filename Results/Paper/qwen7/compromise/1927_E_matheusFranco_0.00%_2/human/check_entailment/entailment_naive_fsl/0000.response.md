Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all potential cases. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. 

Consider the following example:
- For `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the expected output should be a permutation where the sums of continuous segments of length 2 differ by no more than 1. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this property.

Let's take a concrete example:
- Input: `n = 4`, `k = 2`
- Expected Output: A valid k-level permutation could be `[1, 2, 3, 4]` because the sums of continuous segments of length 2 are `1+2=3` and `3+4=7`, and the difference is `4`, which is greater than 1.

The current implementation does not handle this requirement correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
