Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to `0`.
   - It uses a loop to fill the `permutation` list according to a specific pattern:
     - It starts with `curr_v = 1`.
     - It places `curr_v` at positions `i`, `i+k`, `i+2k`, etc., up to the end of the list.
     - After placing a value, it increments `curr_v` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and then decrements `t`.

### Verification of the Logic:

1. **Pattern of Filling the Permutation**:
   - The pattern used in `func_1` ensures that each segment of length `k` will have a unique starting value.
   - Specifically, the values placed at indices `0, k, 2k, ...` will be `1, 2, 3, ...`.
   - This guarantees that the sums of any continuous segments of length `k` will differ by at most 1.

2. **Checking the k-Level Condition**:
   - Given the pattern, consider the sums of segments of length `k`:
     - The first segment is `[1, 2, 3, ..., k]` which sums to `(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k) = k(k+1)/2`.
     - The next segment is `[k+1, k+2, k+3, ..., 2k]` which sums to `(k+1 + k+2 + k+3 + ... + 2k) = k(2k+1)/2`.
     - The difference between these sums is `k/2`, which is constant and does not depend on the actual values within the segments.
   - Since `k` is even, `k/2` is an integer, and the difference between any two such sums will be exactly `k/2`, which is at most 1 when considering the nature of the pattern.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1` for each one.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
