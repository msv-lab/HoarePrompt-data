You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

def func_1():

    #State: Output State: `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 1, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) is set to `i + 1` for all iterations `i` from 0 to `k-1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `curr_v` is `n * k + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the `permutation` list will have its elements set according to the rule specified in the loop body, with every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) being set to `i + 1`. The loop runs for `k` iterations, and during each iteration, `curr_v` is incremented by `k` each time `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is updated. Since the loop increments `curr_v` by 1 each time through the loop and there are `k` iterations, `curr_v` will be `k + 1` at the end of the first iteration, `2 * k + 1` at the end of the second iteration, and so on, up to `k * k + 1` at the end of the last iteration. Therefore, `curr_v` will be `n * k + 1` when the loop finishes. All other variables (`idx`, `idx_v`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i`) will be as described.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: "1 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 ..." (where the exact numbers depend on the values of n and k)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a non-positive integer.
    #
    #This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will no longer be a positive integer. Since the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration and stops when `t` is no longer greater than 0, `t` will eventually reach 0 or become negative, making it a non-positive integer.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a permutation of length `n` such that for any two sums of continuous segments of length `k`, the difference between these sums is at most 1.
   - The program should handle multiple test cases.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
   - It initializes an array `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses a loop to fill the array in a specific pattern:
     - It starts with `curr_v = 1`.
     - For each index `i` in the range `[0, k)`, it places `curr_v` at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` until it reaches the end of the array.
     - It increments `curr_v` after placing it in each position.
   - Finally, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and then decrements `t`.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The pattern used in `func_1` ensures that each segment of length `k` will have a consistent set of values repeated.
   - Specifically, the values placed at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` will be the same for each `i` in the range `[0, k)`.
   - This means that the sum of any segment of length `k` will be the same, ensuring that the condition for a k-level permutation is satisfied.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints properly, including the guarantee that `k` is even and `k <= n`.
   - The program also ensures that the permutation is of length `n` and contains all integers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by using a loop in `func_2`.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to generate a k-level permutation for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
