Output State: `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) is set to `i + 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `curr_v` is 4, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be incremented until it is no longer less than the length of the `permutation` list. This means that the loop will stop once `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is equal to or greater than `len(permutation)`. At this point, `curr_v` will be equal to `k + 1` because it starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The `permutation` list will have its elements set according to the rule specified in the loop body, with every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) being set to `i + 1`.
