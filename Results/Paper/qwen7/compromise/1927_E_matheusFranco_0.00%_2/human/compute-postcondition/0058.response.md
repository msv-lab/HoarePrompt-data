Functionality: **The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user, where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`, `k` is even, and `n - k + 1 ≥ 1`. It then constructs a list `permutation` of length `n` and sets every `i * k`-th element (starting from index `k`) to `i + 1` for all iterations `i` from `0` to `k-1`. Finally, it prints the list `permutation` as a space-separated string.**
