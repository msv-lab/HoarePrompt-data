Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 2, `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `2 * 2`-th element (starting from 2) is set to `2 + 1`, `curr_v` is 6, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 4, and the second element of `permutation` is now 5.**

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by the value of `k`. Initially, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2 and `k` is 2. So, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes 2 + 2 = 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
