Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 7, `permutation` has its `multiples_of_k_plus_i` index updated with `curr_v`, `n` must be greater than 7**

The code updates the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` with the value of `curr_v`. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` remains 7, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 7 is still valid.
