Output State: `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 1, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) is set to `i + 1` for all iterations `i` from 0 to `k-1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `curr_v` is `n * k + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be incremented until it is no longer less than the length of the `permutation` list. This means that the loop will stop once `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is equal to or greater than `len(permutation)`. The loop runs for `k` iterations, and during each iteration, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to the current value of `curr_v`, which starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The `permutation` list will have its elements set according to the rule specified in the loop body, with every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) being set to `i + 1`. Since the loop runs `k` times, the `permutation` list will have its elements set for all indices that are multiples of `k` up to the length of the list. The final value of `curr_v` will be `n * k + 1` because it starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each of the `k * n` updates made to the `permutation` list.
