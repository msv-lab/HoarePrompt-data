Let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. `idx` is 1.
2. `idx_v` is 1.
3. `permutation` is a list of `n` elements. The value of each `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) is set to `i + 1` for all iterations `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
4. `n` is an integer input from the user.
5. `k` is an integer input from the user.
6. `curr_v` is `n * k + 1`.
7. `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`.
8. `result` is a string containing space-separated integers representing the permutation list.

Given these details, let's determine the contents of `permutation` and `result`.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Understanding `permutation`:**
   - `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
   - For each `i` from 0 to `k-1`, the `i * k`-th element is set to `i + 1`.
   - This means the first `k` elements of the list are filled according to the rule, and the rest are undefined or default (assuming they are not specified otherwise).

2. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `n = 5` and `k = 3`.
     - The first `k` elements (3 elements) will be filled as follows:
       - `permutation[0] = 1` (since `i = 0` and `i * k = 0`)
       - `permutation[3] = 2` (since `i = 1` and `i * k = 3`)
       - `permutation[6] = 3` (since `i = 2` and `i * k = 6`)

     - The remaining elements (2 elements) will be undefined or default (e.g., 0 or None).

   - So, `permutation` might look like `[1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, ...]`.

3. **Result String:**
   - `result` is a string containing space-separated integers representing the permutation list.
   - Given the example above, if `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the `permutation` list would be `[1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, ...]`.
   - The `result` string would be `"1 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 ..."`.

### Conclusion:

The `result` string contains the space-separated integers representing the `permutation` list. Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, the `result` string will depend on those inputs.

Output: **"1 0 0 2 0 0 3 0 0 ..." (where the exact numbers depend on the values of n and k)**
