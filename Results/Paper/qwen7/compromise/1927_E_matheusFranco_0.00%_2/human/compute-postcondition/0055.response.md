Output State: **`idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 1, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `i * k`-th element (starting from `k`) is set to `i + 1` for all iterations `i` from 0 to `k-1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `curr_v` is `n * k + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`, `result` is a string containing space-separated integers representing the permutation list.**

Explanation: The code snippet converts the `permutation` list into a string where each element is separated by a space. Since no other operations are performed on the variables `idx`, `idx_v`, `n`, `k`, `curr_v`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, their values remain unchanged. The only new variable created is `result`, which holds the string representation of the `permutation` list.
