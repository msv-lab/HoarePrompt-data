Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now equal to `i`, and `i` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to `curr_v`.**

This means that the value of `curr_v` has been incremented by 1, and the element in the `permutation` list at the index specified by `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been updated to the new value of `curr_v`. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
