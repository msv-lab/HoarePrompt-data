Output State: `i` is 3, `last_year` is 4.

Explanation: Based on the given loop and its behavior over the first three iterations, we can deduce the final state after all iterations. The loop runs until `i` reaches `n`. Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, it will reach 3 as the maximum value within the first three iterations. After these iterations, `i` will no longer satisfy the condition `i < n` (where `n` is the length of the list `a`), thus ending the loop. At this point, `last_year` has been updated to 4 after the third iteration, and `i` will be 3 since it increments just before the loop condition is checked again.
