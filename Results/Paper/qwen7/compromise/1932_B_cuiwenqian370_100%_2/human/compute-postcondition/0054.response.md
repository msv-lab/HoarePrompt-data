Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` must be less than 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.
   - `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i] * a[i]`).

3. **Determine the Next Values for `i` and `n`:**
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`, if the loop is to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Given that `i` must be less than 4 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value for `i` would be `4` (since it was `i < 4` and now it should be `i = 4` to check if `i < n` still holds true).
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain greater than 3.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` must be 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.

5. **Consider the Expression for `next_year`:**
   - The expression for `next_year` depends on `last_year` and `a[i]`. Since `i` is now 4, we need to ensure that `a[4]` exists and that the expression for `next_year` remains valid.

6. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - `i` must be 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `last_year` and `next_year` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 3**.
