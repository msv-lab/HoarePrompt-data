Output State: **`index` is 3, `T` is an integer from the list `data` at position 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[3]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces; `results` is an empty list, `T` must be at least 1**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 2, so after executing `index += 1`, `index` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
