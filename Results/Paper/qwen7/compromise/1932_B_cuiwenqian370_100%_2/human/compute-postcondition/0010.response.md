Output State: **`index` is 3 + n, `T` is an integer from the list `data` at position 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[3]`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces; `results` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from index 3 to 3+n to integers.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. All other variables retain their initial states.
