Output State: **`i` is 3, `last_year` is 4, `results` is ['4'], `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`**

The code assigns an integer value from `data[index]` to the variable `n`. Since the exact value of `data[index]` is not specified, `n` is described as an integer obtained from `data[index]`. The other variables (`i`, `last_year`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
