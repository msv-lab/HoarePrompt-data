Output State: **`i` must be less than 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i`] * `a[i]`).**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_year` based on the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Since `last_year` is equal to `next_year` initially, `next_year` is recalculated using the updated formula. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
