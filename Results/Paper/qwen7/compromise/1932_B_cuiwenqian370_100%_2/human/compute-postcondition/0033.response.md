Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `last_year` is calculated as `(last_year + 1 - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue if `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `last_year` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body (as indicated by the comment "# the loop body is omit").

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `last_year` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`**
