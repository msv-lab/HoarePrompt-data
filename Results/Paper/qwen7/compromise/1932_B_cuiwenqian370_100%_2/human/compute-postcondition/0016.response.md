Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 1, `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]`, `last_year` equals `next_year`**.

Explanation: The value of `i` remains 2. The value of `n` is unchanged and must still be at least 1. The calculation for `next_year` is updated to `(last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]`. Since `last_year` is equal to `next_year` before the update, the new value of `next_year` is also assigned to `last_year`.
