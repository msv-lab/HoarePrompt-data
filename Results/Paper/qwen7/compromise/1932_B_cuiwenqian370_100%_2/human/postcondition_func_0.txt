The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it computes a final value `last_year` based on a specific formula involving the elements of the list `a`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final computed value for each test case, formatted as a list of strings.
