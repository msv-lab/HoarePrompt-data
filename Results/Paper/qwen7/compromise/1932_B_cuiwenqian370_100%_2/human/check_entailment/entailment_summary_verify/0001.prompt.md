You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:

    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        results.append(str(last_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1000) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it computes a final value `last_year` based on a specific formula involving the elements of the list `a`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final computed value for each test case, formatted as a list of strings.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - It then splits the input into a list of strings.
   - The variable `T` is correctly extracted as the number of test cases.
   - The loop iterates over each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts `n` (number of signs).
   - It then extracts the list of periodicities `a`.
   - The variable `last_year` is initialized to the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - The program uses a loop to calculate the year when each subsequent sign occurs.
   - For each sign `i`, it calculates the next year `next_year` such that the sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
   - This calculation is done using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 - 1}{a[i]}\right) \times a[i]
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left\lceil \frac{\text{last\_year}}{a[i]} \right\rceil \times a[i]
     \]
   - This ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Updating `last_year`:**
   - After calculating `next_year`, `last_year` is updated to `next_year`.

5. **Storing Results:**
   - The final year for the last sign is appended to the `results` list.

6. **Outputting Results:**
   - The results are joined into a single string with newline separators and written to stdout.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the program against the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 6`
  - `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Calculations:
    - First sign: `3`
    - Second sign: `4` (after 3)
    - Third sign: `8` (after 4)
    - Fourth sign: `10` (after 8)
    - Fifth sign: `18` (after 10)
    - Sixth sign: `36` (after 18)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 5`
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Calculations:
    - First sign: `1`
    - Second sign: `2` (after 1)
    - Third sign: `3` (after 2)
    - Fourth sign: `4` (after 3)
    - Fifth sign: `5` (after 4)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 5`
  - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Calculations:
    - First sign: `1`
    - Second sign: `2` (after 1)
    - Third sign: `3` (after 2)
    - Fourth sign: `4` (after 3)
    - Fifth sign: `5` (after 4)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `n = 6`
  - `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - Calculations:
    - First sign: `50`
    - Second sign: `80` (after 50)
    - Third sign: `1511` (after 80)
    - Fourth sign: `2012` (after 1511)

The program correctly implements the logic to find the year when the nth sign occurs based on the given periodicities. Therefore, the program is correct.
