Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program initializes counters `ac` and `bc` to zero, which will be used to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' respectively.
3. The program iterates through each character in the input string `s` and updates the counters accordingly.
4. After counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', the program compares the two counts and prints the appropriate character ('A' or 'B') based on which one is more frequent.
5. The program handles all test cases as specified in the problem statement, ensuring that the input constraints are respected and the output is produced correctly for each test case.

Given the above points, the program logic is sound and matches the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
