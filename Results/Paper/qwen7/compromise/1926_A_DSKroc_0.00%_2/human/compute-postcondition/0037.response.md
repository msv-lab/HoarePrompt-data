Postcondition: `ac` is 2 if the current character `i` is 'A' and the next character in `s` is also 'A', otherwise `ac` is 1. `bc` is 1 + 1 if the current character `i` is not 'A' and the next character in `s` is 'A', otherwise `bc` is 1. `q` is `t`, and `s` is the remaining part of the string after removing the current character `i`.
