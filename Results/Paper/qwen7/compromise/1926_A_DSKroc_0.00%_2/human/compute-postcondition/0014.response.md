Output State: **`i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is 1 if `i` is 'A', `bc` is 2 if `i` is not 'A'**

Explanation: The code `bc += 1` increments the value of `bc` by 1. If `i` was not 'A' (meaning `ac` was 1), then `bc` was initially 1, and after the increment, `bc` becomes 2. The value of `i` and the condition for `ac` remain unchanged.
