Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is a string.
- If `i` is equal to 'A', then `ac` is 1.
- If `i` is not equal to 'A', then `bc` is 1.

### Loop Statement
```python
for i in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the sequence `s`.
2. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next character in the sequence `s`.

### Possible Scenarios
- If `i` was 'A' in the previous iteration, `ac` is 1.
- If `i` was not 'A' in the previous iteration, `bc` is 1.

### Adjusting States
- `i` will change to the next character in the sequence `s`.
- If `i` was 'A', the next character could either be 'A' or something else.
- If `i` was not 'A', the next character could either be 'A' or something else.

### New State
- `i` will be the next character in `s`.
- `ac` will be 1 if the next `i` is 'A'.
- `bc` will be 1 if the next `i` is not 'A'.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is the next character in `s`, `ac` is 1 if `i` is 'A', `bc` is 1 if `i` is not 'A'**
