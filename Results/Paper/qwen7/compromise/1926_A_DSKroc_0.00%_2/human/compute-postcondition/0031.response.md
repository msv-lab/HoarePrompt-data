Output State: **`ac` is 0, `bc` is 1, `q` is `t`, `s` is a non-empty string, and the character `i` is not 'A'**

Explanation: The code `bc += 1` increments the value of `bc` by 1. Initially, `bc` is 0, so after executing this line, `bc` becomes 1. The values of the other variables (`ac`, `q`, `s`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
