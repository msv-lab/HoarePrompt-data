Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 32.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    ac = 0
    bc = 0
    s = input()
    for i in s:
        if i == 'A':
            ac += 1
        else:
            bc += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: All characters in the string `s` have been iterated over, `ac` is the total count of 'A's in `s`, and `bc` is the total count of non-'A' characters in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `ac` will be the total count of 'A' characters in the string `s`, and `bc` will be the total count of characters that are not 'A' in the string `s`. The variable `q` remains `t`, and `s` is the original input string without any modifications.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ac` is an integer between 0 and the length of `s`, inclusive, `bc` is an integer between 0 and the length of `s`, inclusive, `q` is `t`, `s` is an empty string, `i` is irrelevant since the loop has completed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
