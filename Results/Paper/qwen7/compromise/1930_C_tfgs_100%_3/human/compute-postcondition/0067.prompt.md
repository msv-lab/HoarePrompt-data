Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if i > 0:
        adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
        for j in range(adv):
            ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
        cnt -= adv
        cur -= adv
    ans.append(a[i])
    counter[a[i]] -= 1
    cur += counter[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cur` is decreased by `adv` plus the value of `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv`, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `adv` must be greater than 0, `i` is within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, and `ans` now includes `a[i]` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cur` is equal to `cur` + `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv + 1`, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `adv` is equal to `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - 1`, `ans` now includes all elements from `a[i+1]` up to `a[i-1] - (adv - 1) - 1` appended to it, `j` is `adv - 1`, `counter[a[i+1]]` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cur` is equal to `cur` + `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv + 1`, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `adv` is equal to `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - 1`, `ans` now includes all elements from `a[i+1]` up to `a[i-1] - (adv - 1) - 1` appended to it, `j` is `adv - 1`, `counter[a[i+1]]` is decremented by 1, `ans` includes the element `a[i]` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
