Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as the input is only affecting `n`. The precondition for `t` is still valid, and `n` is now an integer input within the specified range.
