Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `adv`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `j < adv`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `cur` is decreased by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`
   - `adv` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`
   - `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order
   - `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new list `a`
   - `cnt` is `n - len(a)`
   - `ans` is a list containing `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, where `j` is 0

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `adv`.
   - Since `j` is currently 0 (at the end of the previous iteration), it needs to be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `j` will be updated to 1.
   - `adv` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`cur` is decreased by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `adv` must be greater than 0, `i` is within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `j` is 1.**
