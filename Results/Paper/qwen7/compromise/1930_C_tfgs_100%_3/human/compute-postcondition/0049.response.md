Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each element in the list `a`, so the loop condition is based on `i`.

3. **Determine the Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cur` is equal to `cur` + `counter[a[i]]`
   - `cnt` is reduced by `adv + 1`
   - `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1
   - `adv` is equal to `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order
   - `cnt` is `n - len(a) - 1`
   - `ans` now includes all elements from `a[i+1]` up to `a[i-1] - (adv - 1) - 1` appended to it
   - `j` is `adv - 1`
   - `counter[a[i+1]]` is decremented by 1

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
   - Since `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, the value of `a[i]` will be the next element in the list.

5. **Calculate the New Values**:
   - `cur` remains unchanged as it is not directly dependent on `i` but on the values inside the loop.
   - `cnt` is reduced by `adv + 1`, where `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`.
   - `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.
   - `adv` is recalculated using the new value of `a[i]`.
   - `i` is set to `i + 1`.
   - `a` remains the same list.
   - `cnt` remains the same as it is not directly dependent on `i`.
   - `ans` will include elements from `a[i+1]` up to `a[i-1] - (adv - 1) - 1` appended to it.
   - `j` is set to `adv - 1`.
   - `counter[a[i+1]]` is decremented by 1.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `a` remains the same.
   - `cnt` is reduced by `adv + 1`.
   - `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.
   - `adv` is recalculated.
   - `ans` includes elements from `a[i+1]` up to `a[i-1] - (adv - 1) - 1` appended to it.
   - `j` is `adv - 1`.
   - `counter[a[i+1]]` is decremented by 1.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`cur` is equal to `cur` + `counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv + 1`, `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1, `adv` is equal to `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `cnt` is `n - len(a) - 1`, `ans` now includes all elements from `a[i+1]` up to `a[i-1] - (adv - 1) - 1` appended to it, `j` is `adv - 1`, `counter[a[i+1]]` is decremented by 1.**
