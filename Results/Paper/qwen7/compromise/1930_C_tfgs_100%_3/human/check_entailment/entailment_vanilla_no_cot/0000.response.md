Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to achieve the lexicographically largest possible array `b`. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Insertions and Deletions**:
   - The program directly modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element. However, it does not properly handle the deletion of elements from `a` when they are added to the set `S`.
   - The logic for constructing the final array `b` from the set `S` is flawed. It does not ensure that the elements are inserted in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the resulting array `b`.

2. **Incorrect Use of `Counter`**:
   - The `Counter` object is used to count occurrences of elements in `a`, but this information is not utilized effectively to construct the desired array `b`.

3. **Sorting and Construction Logic**:
   - The sorting and construction logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the process of inserting elements into the set `S` and then sorting them in decreasing order to form `b`.

### Correct Approach:
To achieve the lexicographically largest `b`, you need to carefully manage the insertion and deletion steps to maximize the values in `S`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Step 1: Insert a_i + i into S and remove a_i from a
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(a[i] + i + 1)
        a[i] -= i + 1

    # Step 2: Construct the lexicographically largest b
    b = sorted(s, reverse=True)

    # Output the result
    print(' '.join(map(str, b)))
```

This approach ensures that:
- Each element `a_i + i + 1` is correctly inserted into the set `S`.
- The set `S` is then sorted in decreasing order to form the array `b`.
- The final array `b` is printed in the required format.

This corrected program should produce the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case.
