You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of test cases) and a string `s` (of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters). For each test case, it checks if `s` contains only one unique character or is a single character. If these conditions are met, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it generates a new string `s2` by either randomly shuffling the characters of `s` or performing a cyclic shift if the shuffle results in the original string. It then prints 'Yes' followed by `s2`. The function outputs this information for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the number of test cases by using a loop to process each test case individually.
2. **Single Character String Check**: If the string `s` consists of only one unique character (e.g., "aaaaa"), the program correctly identifies that no rearrangement can produce a different string and prints "No".
3. **All Characters Same Check**: If all characters in the string `s` are the same but there are more than one character (e.g., "xxxxx"), the program also correctly identifies that no rearrangement can produce a different string and prints "No".
4. **Rearrangement Logic**: For other strings, the program attempts to generate a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of `s`. If the shuffled string `s2` is the same as `s`, it tries to create a different string by rotating the first character to the end (e.g., "co" becomes "oc").
5. **Output Format**: The program outputs "Yes" followed by the rearranged string `s2` if a different string is found, or "No" if no such string exists.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- **Random Shuffling**: Using `random.sample(s, len(s))` to shuffle the string might not always produce a different string, especially for short strings. This method can sometimes return the original string.
- **Rotation Logic**: The rotation logic (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`) is not sufficient to guarantee a different string for all cases. For example, if the string is "aa", this logic will not work.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases like strings with repeated characters but different arrangements (e.g., "aab" vs "aba").

### Example Analysis:

- **"codeforces"**: The program should find a different arrangement, e.g., "forcodesec".
- **"aaaaa"**: The program correctly outputs "No" since all characters are the same.
- **"xxxxy"**: The program should find a different arrangement, e.g., "xxyxx".
- **"co"**: The program should find a different arrangement, e.g., "oc".
- **"d"**: The program correctly outputs "No" since it's a single character.
- **"nutdealer"**: The program should find a different arrangement, e.g., "undetaler".
- **"mwistht"**: The program should find a different arrangement, e.g., "thtsiwm".

### Conclusion:

While the program attempts to solve the problem, it does not guarantee a correct solution for all cases due to the limitations of the random shuffling and rotation logic. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
