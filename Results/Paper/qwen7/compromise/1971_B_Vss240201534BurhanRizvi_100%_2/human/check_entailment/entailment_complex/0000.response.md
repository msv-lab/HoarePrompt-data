Reasoning:
1. The function correctly handles the case where the string `s` consists of a single unique character. In such cases, it prints "No" because no rearrangement of the string can produce a different string.
2. The function also correctly handles the case where the string `s` has more than one unique character. It generates a new string `s2` by shuffling the characters of `s`.
3. There is a potential issue with the condition `if s == s2:`. This condition is unnecessary and can be removed because the purpose of generating `s2` is to ensure it is different from `s`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, the function should perform a cyclic shift instead. However, the current implementation already ensures that `s2` is different by using `random.sample` which guarantees a different permutation.
4. The function correctly handles the case where the shuffled string `s2` is the same as the original string `s`. In this case, it performs a cyclic shift to ensure `s2` is different from `s`.

Given the above points, the function logic is sound and correctly implements the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
