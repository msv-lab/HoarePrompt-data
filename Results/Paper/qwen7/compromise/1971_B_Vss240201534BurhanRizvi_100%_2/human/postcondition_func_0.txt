The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of test cases) and a string `s` (of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters). For each test case, it checks if `s` contains only one unique character or is a single character. If these conditions are met, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it generates a new string `s2` by either randomly shuffling the characters of `s` or performing a cyclic shift if the shuffle results in the original string. It then prints 'Yes' followed by `s2`. The function outputs this information for each test case.
