You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i is a list of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively, such that 0 ≤ p_i[0] + p_i[1] + p_i[2] + p_i[3] ≤ 200.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2, repeated for the number of times specified by the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of four integers representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. It calculates a count based on specific conditions involving these integers and prints the result. Specifically, it increments a counter by 1 if certain conditions are met and then adds the floor division of each integer in the list by 2 to the counter. The function does not return any value but prints the final count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The given solution attempts to calculate the sum of the counts divided by 2, which is not relevant to the problem. Instead, the program should focus on the parity (odd or even) of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s to determine the optimal strategy for Bob to win.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

1. Alice wins if the XOR of all numbers is non-zero.
2. Bob wins if the XOR of all numbers is zero.
3. Eve wants to maximize the number of Bob's wins by removing numbers optimally.

The key observation is that the XOR of the sequence is determined by the parity of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. Specifically:
- If the count of 1s is odd, the XOR will be 1.
- If the count of 1s is even, the XOR will be 0 if the counts of 2s, 3s, and 4s also result in an even XOR.

Given this, the optimal strategy for Eve is to remove numbers to ensure that the XOR remains zero as long as possible. Here’s a corrected approach:

```python
def max_bob_wins(p):
    ones, twos, threes, fours = p
    # Calculate the maximum number of Bob's wins
    # Bob wins if the XOR is zero, which happens when the count of 1s is even
    # and the counts of 2s, 3s, and 4s do not affect the XOR.
    if ones % 2 == 0:
        return min(twos, threes, fours)
    else:
        return min(twos, threes, fours) + 1

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max_bob_wins(p))

func()
```

This corrected version checks the parity of the counts of 1s and calculates the maximum number of Bob's wins based on the counts of 2s, 3s, and 4s.
