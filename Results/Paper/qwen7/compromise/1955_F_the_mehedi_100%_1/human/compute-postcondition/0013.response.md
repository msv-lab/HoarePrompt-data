Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers.
- `cnt` is the sum of the floor division of each element in `a` by 2 after the loop has executed all its iterations.

The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`.

To break it down further:
- Each element in the list `a` undergoes a floor division operation (`// 2`).
- The results of these operations are summed up to get `cnt`.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of the floor division of each element in the list `a` by 2)**
