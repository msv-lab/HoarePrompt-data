To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `cnt` is increased by the floor division of each element in `a` by 2.

2. **Operations**:
   - For each element in the list `a`, `cnt` is incremented by the result of the floor division of that element by 2.

Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we cannot give a specific numerical value for `cnt`. However, we can describe it in terms of the list `a`.

Let's denote the elements of the list `a` as `a[0], a[1], a[2], ...`.

For each element `a[i]` in the list `a`, `cnt` is incremented by `a[i] // 2`.

Therefore, the value of `cnt` after processing all elements in `a` would be:
\[ cnt = \left\lfloor \frac{a[0]}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a[1]}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{a[2]}{2} \right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor \frac{a[n-1]}{2} \right\rfloor \]
where `n` is the length of the list `a`.

Given this, the print statement will output the value of `cnt` which is the sum of the floor divisions of each element in `a` by 2.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the sum of the floor divisions of each element in the list a by 2)**
