Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. After all iterations, `idx` will be set to the largest index `i` such that `1 << i` is less than or equal to the maximum `k` value encountered across all test cases. The list `nums` will contain the following elements:

- All powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
- For each `k` value, the elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
- The length of `nums` will be `24 + t`, as we start with 21 elements (powers of 2) and add 3 elements per test case.

The final state of `nums` will include all the unique elements added during the iterations, and the length of `nums` will reflect the total number of unique elements plus the initial 21 elements.
