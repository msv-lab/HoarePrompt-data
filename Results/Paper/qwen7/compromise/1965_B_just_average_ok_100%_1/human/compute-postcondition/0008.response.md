Output State: **`idx` is -2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^20, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the only effect is that we know the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial or given states.
