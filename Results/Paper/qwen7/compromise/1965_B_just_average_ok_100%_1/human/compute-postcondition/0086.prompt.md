You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. After all iterations, `idx` will be set to the largest index `i` such that `1 << i` is less than or equal to the maximum `k` value encountered across all test cases. The list `nums` will contain the following elements:
    #
    #- All powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
    #- For each `k` value, the elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
    #- The length of `nums` will be `24 + t`, as we start with 21 elements (powers of 2) and add 3 elements per test case.
    #
    #The final state of `nums` will include all the unique elements added during the iterations, and the length of `nums` will reflect the total number of unique elements plus the initial 21 elements.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, n is a positive integer within the range of 2 to 10^6, and k is a positive integer within the range of 1 to n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7. The function returns a result based on the values of n and k for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
