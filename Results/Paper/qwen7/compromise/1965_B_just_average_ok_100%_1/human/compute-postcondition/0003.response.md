Output State: **`idx` is -1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^20.**

The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `idx`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
