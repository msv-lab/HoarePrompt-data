Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, n is a positive integer within the range of 2 to 10^6, and k is a positive integer within the range of 1 to n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7. The function returns a result based on the values of n and k for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing t, n, and k, and for each set of n and k, it calculates or determines something (though the specific calculation or determination is not detailed here).
