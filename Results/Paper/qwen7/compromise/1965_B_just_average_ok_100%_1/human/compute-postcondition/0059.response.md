Output State: **`i` is 20, `len(nums)` is 21, `idx` is -1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums[-1]` is 2097151, `nums` is a list of 21 elements where each element is a power of 2 starting from 1 to \(2^{20}\)**.

Explanation: The line `idx = -1` simply reassigns the variable `idx` to the value `-1`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `len(nums)`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged.
