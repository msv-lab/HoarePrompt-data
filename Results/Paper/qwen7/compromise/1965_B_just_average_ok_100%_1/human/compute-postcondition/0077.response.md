Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 17, `nums` contains a new element which is `k - nums[idx]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nums.append(k - nums[idx])` appends the value of `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Since the initial value of `idx` is 17, the value being appended to `nums` is `k - nums[17]`. The variables `i` and `idx` remain unchanged from their initial states.
