Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all test cases provided via input are processed. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions will hold true:

- `t` will be the total number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` will be as initially provided.
- `nums` will be a list containing a series of integers derived from the operations within the loop, specifically tailored to the value of `k` for each test case.
- The final state of `nums` for each test case will include the elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, where `idx` is determined based on the value of `k` relative to the powers of 2 in the initial list.
- The length of `nums` for each test case will be printed, which is the count of elements in the modified list after removing one element and appending three new ones.
- The loop will terminate once all test cases have been processed, and no further iterations will occur.
