Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 17, `nums` contains elements such that one of them is `k - nums[idx]` and another is `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. The values of `i` and `idx` remain unchanged. Initially, `nums` contained an element which was `k - nums[idx]`. After appending `k + 1`, `nums` now contains both `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1`.
