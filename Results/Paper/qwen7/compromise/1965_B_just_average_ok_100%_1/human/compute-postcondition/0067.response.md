Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `idx` is `i - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is assigned the value of `i - 1`. Since `i` was the value from the previous iteration and is now `i + 1`, `idx` becomes `(i + 1) - 1`, which simplifies to `i`. The initial state of `nums` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
