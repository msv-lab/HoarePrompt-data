Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 21.
   - `idx` is 16.
   - `nums` contains elements such that one of them is `k - nums[idx]`.
   - Another element is `k + 1`.
   - `nums` now includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(len(nums))
   ```

3. **Determine the Length of `nums`:**
   - We know that `nums` contains at least three distinct elements:
     - One element is `k - nums[idx]`.
     - Another element is `k + 1`.
     - And `nums` now includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - Therefore, the length of `nums` is at least 3.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the length of `nums` is determined by the elements described, and no other elements are mentioned, the length of `nums` is exactly 3.

Output: **3**
