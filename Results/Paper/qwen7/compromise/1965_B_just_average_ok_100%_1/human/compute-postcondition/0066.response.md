Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `nums`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range of `len(nums)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was set to `i - 1` if `nums[i]` was greater than `k`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.
   - **List `nums`**: The list itself does not change within the loop; only the value of `i` changes.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, let's consider the possible scenarios:
- If `nums[i]` was greater than `k`, then `i` would be set to `i - 1`.
- If `nums[i]` was not greater than `k`, then `i` would remain the same as its value from the previous iteration.

Since the loop condition is based on the range of `len(nums)`, the loop will continue as long as `i` is within the bounds of the list (i.e., `0 <= i < len(nums)`).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
- **If `i` was set to `i - 1`**: This means `i` is now one less than its value from the previous iteration.
- **If `i` remained unchanged**: This means `i` is the same as its value from the previous iteration.

### Possible States:
- If `i` was set to `i - 1` and is still within the bounds of the list, the loop can continue.
- If `i` remained unchanged and is still within the bounds of the list, the loop can continue.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the bounds of the list (`0 <= i < len(nums)`). Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is adjusted correctly for the next iteration.

### Final State:
- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `nums` remains unchanged.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`nums` is the same list, `i` is `i + 1` where `i` was the value from the previous iteration**.
