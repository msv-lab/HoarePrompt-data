Output State: **`idx` is -2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^20, `i` is 0, `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`, and the current value of `nums[i]` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation: The code `idx = i - 1` updates the value of `idx` to be `i - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `idx` is updated to -1 - 1, which is -2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
