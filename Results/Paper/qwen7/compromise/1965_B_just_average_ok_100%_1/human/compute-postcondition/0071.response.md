Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `nums`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over the range of the length of `nums`. This means `i` will take values from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `nums` is the same list as before.
   - `i` is `i + 1` after the previous iteration.

4. **Analyze the Loop Body**:
   - If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `idx` is set to `i - 1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
   - If `nums[i]` is not greater than `k`, then no changes occur to `i` or `idx`.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is `i + 1` after the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1 + 1 = i + 2`.
   - We need to check if `nums[i + 2]` is greater than `k` to decide the next state.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `nums` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes `i + 2`.
   - `idx` is not mentioned in the loop body, so it remains unchanged unless explicitly set within the loop body (which is not the case here).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`nums` is the same list, `i` is `i + 2`**.
