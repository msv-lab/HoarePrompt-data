### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. No subsequence of the sequence `a` should have a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 \le v \le n` where `v \ne k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]  # Initial list of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^20
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])  # Add k - max power of 2 <= k
        nums.append(k + 1)          # Add k + 1
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)  # Add k + max power of 2 + 1
        nums.remove(1 << idx)        # Remove the largest power of 2 <= k
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It initializes a list `nums` with all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
- For each \(k\), it appends specific values to `nums`:
  - \(k - \text{max power of 2} \leq k\)
  - \(k + 1\)
  - \(k + \text{max power of 2} + 1\)
- It removes the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\).
- Finally, it prints the length of the list and the list itself.

#### Analysis:
1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - The program adds \(k - \text{max power of 2} \leq k\), ensuring that there is no subsequence summing directly to `k` because the added value is constructed to avoid this.
   - The addition of \(k + 1\) and \(k + \text{max power of 2} + 1\) ensures that the sequence can generate sums from `k+1` to `k + 2^{20}`.
   - The removal of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` ensures that the sequence does not include `k` itself.

2. **Subsequences Summing to Other Values:**
   - The sequence generated includes all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), which means it can form any sum from 1 to \(2^{21} - 1\).
   - Since `n` is at most \(10^6\), the sequence can definitely form any sum from 1 to `n` using combinations of these powers of 2.

Given the above points, the program correctly constructs a sequence that meets both requirements:
- No subsequence sums to `k`.
- All other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) are possible through subsequences.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct according to the problem description and the function summary.
