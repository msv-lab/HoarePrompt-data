Output State: The output state will be a list of integers, each representing the value printed during each iteration of the loop based on the input values provided for `x` and `y`. The length of this list will be equal to the value of `ap`, and each element in the list will be calculated according to the conditions specified in the loop body. If `x` and `y` are both positive, the value will be the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`. If `x` is zero and `y` is positive, the value will be `math.ceil(y / 2)`. If `x` is positive and `y` is zero, the value will be `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If both `x` and `y` are non-positive, the value will be `0`.
