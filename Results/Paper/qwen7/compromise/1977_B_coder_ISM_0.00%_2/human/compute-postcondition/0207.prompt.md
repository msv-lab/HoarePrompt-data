Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `i` is 29, `nalla` is 31, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[29]` is '1', `s[30]` is either '0' or '1' based on the value of `flag`, and `s[31]` is '1' with `length` being 1.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. If the condition `flag and s[29] == '0'` is true, `s[29]` will be set to '1'. In the else part, regardless of the previous state, `s[29]` will be set to '0', `s[30]` will retain its previous value, `s[31]` will be set to '1', `flag` will be set to 1, and `length` will be 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `length` must be greater than 1, and if `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` is changed to '0'. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `length`, and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `length` must be greater than 1, and `s` remains unchanged. If the element at index 1 of `s` is '-1' and the element at index 0 of `s` is '1', no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `length` must be greater than 2, and `s` is unchanged except for the element at index 2 which is now '-1'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
