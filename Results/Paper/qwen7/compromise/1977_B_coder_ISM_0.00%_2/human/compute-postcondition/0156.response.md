Output State: **`i` is 29, `n` is 29, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[i]` is '-1', `s[i + 1]` is not equal to '0'**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[i]` from its original value (which was either '0' or '1') to '-1'. Given the conditions for `flag`, if `flag` is 1, `s[i]` would remain '0' and `s[i + 1]` would remain not equal to '0', but since `s[i]` is now '-1', these conditions no longer apply. If `flag` is 0, `s[i]` would remain equal to `s[i + 1]`, but again, since `s[i]` is now '-1', `s[i + 1]` must also be '-1' to satisfy the condition, which contradicts the requirement that `s[i + 1]` is not equal to '0'. Therefore, the only consistent state is that `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i + 1]` is not equal to '0'.
