Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing '0', `i` is 0, and `(x & pow(2, i))` is False**

The code `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the list `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
