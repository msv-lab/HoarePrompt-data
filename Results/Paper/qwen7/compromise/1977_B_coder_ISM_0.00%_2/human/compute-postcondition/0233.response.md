Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 elements, and `nalla` is 31.**

Explanation: The variable `flag` is initialized to 0. The values of `i`, `length`, `s`, and `nalla` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is 30, `length` is 30, `s` is a list of 30 elements containing either '1' or '0', and `nalla` is 31.
