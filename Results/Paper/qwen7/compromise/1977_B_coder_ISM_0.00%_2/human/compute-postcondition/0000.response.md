Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, the output state maintains this condition. All other variables remain unchanged.
