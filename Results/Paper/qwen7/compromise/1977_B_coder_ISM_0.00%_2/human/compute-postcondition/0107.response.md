Output State: **`i` is 30, `length` is greater than 30, `s` is an empty list, `s[0]` is '0' or '1', `s[1]` is '1', ..., `s[29]` is '1', `s[30]` is '1' if `s[29]` was '-1' and `s[28]` was '1' during the last iteration, otherwise `s[30]` remains '1', `nalla` is 31, `x` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `s = []` initializes `s` as an empty list, effectively resetting `s` to an empty list while keeping all other variables unchanged.
