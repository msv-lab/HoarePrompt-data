Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 30. After the loop executes all 30 iterations, `s` is a list where each element corresponds to whether the bit at position `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 29) in the binary representation of `x` is set to 1. If the bit is set to 1, the corresponding element in `s` is '1'; otherwise, it is '0'.
