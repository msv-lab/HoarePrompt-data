Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of length 30.

After the loop executes all 30 iterations, `s` will contain 30 elements. Each element in `s` will be either '1' or '0', depending on whether the corresponding bit in the integer `x` is set to 1 or 0. Specifically, `s[29]` corresponds to the least significant bit of `x`, `s[28]` corresponds to the second least significant bit, and so on, up to `s[0]`, which corresponds to the most significant bit of `x`. If the bit at position `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 29) in `x` is set to 1, then `s[i]` will be '1'; otherwise, `s[i]` will be '0'.
