Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a sequence `a` of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
   - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there exists a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Provided Functions Analysis**:
   - **func_1**, **func_2**, **func_3**, **func_4**, **func_5**, **func_6**, **func_9**, **func_10**, **func_11**: These functions do not seem to be directly relevant to solving the problem. They either read input or perform operations unrelated to the problem requirements.
   - **func_7** and **func_8**: These functions read input and return lists of integers, which could be useful for parsing the input.
   - **func_12**: This function seems to be related to dynamic programming or graph traversal but is not used in the main logic.
   - **func_13**: This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - **func_14**: This function generates the required sequence `a` based on the given `n` and `k`. It handles different cases for `k` and constructs the sequence accordingly.
   - **func_15**: This function processes the input and calls `func_14` for each test case, printing the results.

3. **Function 14 Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: When `k == 1`, it generates a sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8]` if `n == 2`, otherwise it generates a sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - **Case 2**: When `k > 1`, it generates a sequence that includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`, along with specific values derived from `k`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_14` correctly handles both cases and generates sequences that satisfy the problem constraints.
   - The function `func_15` correctly processes the input and calls `func_14` for each test case, ensuring the output format is correct.

Given the analysis, the provided functions `func_14` and `func_15` correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
