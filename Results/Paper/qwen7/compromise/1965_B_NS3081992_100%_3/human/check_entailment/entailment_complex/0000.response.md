Reasoning:
- The problem requires generating a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 that meets specific conditions regarding subsequences.
- The annotated functions do not align well with the problem requirements. Most functions are not relevant to the problem, and some do not perform the necessary operations.
- Function `func_14` seems to be the one designed to solve the problem. It handles the logic for constructing the sequence based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`.
- Let's verify if `func_14` correctly generates the sequence according to the problem description:
  - When `k == 1`, it returns `[2, 3, 4, 8]` which is a valid sequence.
  - For other values of `k`, it constructs a sequence that ensures no subsequence sums to `k` but includes all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.
- The main function `func_15` calls `func_14` for each test case and prints the results, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given that `func_14` appears to handle the core logic correctly and `func_15` properly invokes it for each test case, the overall program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
