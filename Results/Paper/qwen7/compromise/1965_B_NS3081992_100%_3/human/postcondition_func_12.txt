The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with `b` being greater than 0) and returns either `(1, 0, a)` when `b` is 0, or `(y, x - a // b * y, g)` otherwise. The function essentially computes values related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, along with the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.
