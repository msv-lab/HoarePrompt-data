        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = lk - 2`. For each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Therefore, if `lk` is 3 (for example, if `k` is 2), the loop will run twice, appending `2 ** 0` and `2 ** 1` to `ans`, resulting in `[1, 2]`. However, since the problem statement does not specify the exact value of `lk`, the general form is provided as `[1, 2, 4]` assuming `lk` is 3.

Specifically, starting from `2 ** lk` up to `2 ** (l - 1)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` and `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
    #State: Postcondition: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`. If `k` equals 1, then `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, `ans` is extended to include elements from `2 ** lk` up to `2 ** (l - 1)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` and `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. All other variables (`b`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged.

    #The program returns the length of ans followed by its elements separated by spaces. The length and elements depend on the conditions given for k and the binary representation of n and k.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes no explicit parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a sequence of numbers represented as a string with the length of the sequence followed by the numbers separated by spaces. If \( k \) is 1, it returns '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list based on the binary representations of \( n \) and \( k \), and returns the length and elements of this list.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It iterates over a range determined by the value returned by `func_10()` and prints the result of calling `func_14()` for each iteration, with each result printed on a new line.
