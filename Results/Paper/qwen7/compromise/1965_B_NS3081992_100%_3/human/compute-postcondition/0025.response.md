Output State: `ans` is [1, 2, 4, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** lk, 2 ** (lk + 1), ..., 2 ** (l - 1)], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `lk` is the length of `bk`.

This means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `ans` will contain the initial elements [1, 2, 4, k + 1, 2 * k + 1] followed by powers of 2 starting from \(2^{lk}\) up to \(2^{l-1}\). The other variables (`b`, `k`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk`) remain unchanged.
