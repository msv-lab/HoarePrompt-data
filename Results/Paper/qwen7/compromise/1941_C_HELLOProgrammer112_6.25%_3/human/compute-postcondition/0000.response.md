Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are:
     - `_`: A placeholder variable used to iterate over the range.
     - `int(input())`: This is the expression that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and doesn't need to be explicitly adjusted since it's just an iterator.
   - The key variable here is `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run. We need to ensure that this input results in a valid number of iterations.

3. **Constraints and Validations:**
   - The problem states that `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - Therefore, the input should be within this range for the loop to execute correctly.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is within the specified range.

**Final State Adjustment:**

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

This ensures that the loop will execute the required number of times based on the valid input provided.
