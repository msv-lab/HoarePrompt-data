Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem. The function simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and prints their sum. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping occurrences or the removal of characters to minimize the deletions needed to eliminate both "map" and "pie" substrings.

For example, consider the string "mapmap". The function would count two occurrences of "map" and zero occurrences of "pie", resulting in a sum of 2. However, to make the string beautiful, we only need to remove one 'm' to get "apmap", which no longer contains "map".

Similarly, for the string "piepie", the function would count two occurrences of "pie" and zero occurrences of "map", resulting in a sum of 2. But we can make the string beautiful by removing just one 'p' to get "iepie".

The function should instead find the minimum deletions required to remove all instances of "map" and "pie" by considering the optimal way to remove characters. A more appropriate approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to ensure the minimum deletions.

Correctness: **False**
