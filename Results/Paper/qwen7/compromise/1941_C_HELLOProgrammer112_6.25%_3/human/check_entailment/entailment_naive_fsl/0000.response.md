Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to make the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum. This approach does not ensure that the string becomes beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. For example, consider the input "mmapnapie":

- The program would count 2 occurrences of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", resulting in a total of 3 deletions.
- However, the optimal solution is to delete only 2 characters (the 4th and 9th characters), which would result in the string "mmnapie", making it beautiful.

This example demonstrates that the program does not work correctly according to the problem description.
