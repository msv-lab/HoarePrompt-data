Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case using a loop.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` representing the frequency of launching for the first and second installations and the visibility time of the fireworks, respectively.
4. The calculation of the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is done using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. This formula accounts for the fact that fireworks launched at multiples of `a` and `b` might overlap, and the `+2` accounts for the initial fireworks launched at time 0.
5. The program prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic in the program appears to be correct. The formula used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is accurate.

Correctness: **True**
