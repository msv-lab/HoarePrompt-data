Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. The formula used is \( \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2 \).

However, this formula does not correctly represent the problem's requirements. The formula counts the number of multiples of \(a\) and \(b\) up to \(m\) and adds 2, which does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. Instead, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\) to determine the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously, and then calculate how many fireworks can be seen at any given time within the visibility period.

To correct the solution, we should:
1. Calculate the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\).
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period.
3. Adjust the count to avoid double-counting the fireworks that appear at the same time due to the LCM.

Given the current implementation, the formula \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2 \) overestimates the number of fireworks visible simultaneously because it does not account for the overlap correctly.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
