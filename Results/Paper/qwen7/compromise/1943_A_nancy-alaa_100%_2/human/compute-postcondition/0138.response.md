Output State: `first` is `False`, `i` is `0`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a `Counter` object containing the counts of each element in `arr`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i` = `n + 2` down to `i` = `0`), the variable `i` will eventually reach `0`. The loop does not modify `n`, `arr`, or `mpp` within its body, so those variables retain their initial values. The variable `first` is only set to `True` when `mpp[i] == 1` and `first` is already `True`, which does not happen in the given iterations. Therefore, `first` remains `False` after the loop completes.
