Output State: **`first` is `False`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the count of each integer in `arr`.**

The variable `first` is set to `False`, while the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `mpp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
