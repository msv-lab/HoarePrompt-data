Output: **i (where i is n + 1)**

Explanation:
- `i` is explicitly stated to be `n + 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user.
- `mpp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in `arr`.
- `mpp[i]` equals 1, but this information is not needed to determine what is printed by the `print(i)` statement.
- `first` being true is also not necessary to determine the output of the `print(i)` statement.

Therefore, the `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is `n + 1`.
