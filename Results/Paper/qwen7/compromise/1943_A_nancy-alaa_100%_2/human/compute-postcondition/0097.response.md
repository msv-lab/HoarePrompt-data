Output State: **`i` is equal to `n` + 2, `first` retains its original value, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string using `input().split()`, and then converts those strings to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The result is assigned to `arr`, which becomes a list of integers. The values of `i`, `first`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
