Output State: **`first` remains False, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement that was checking the conditions related to `i` and `mpp`. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the values of `first` and `i` remain unchanged.
