Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The loop head does not explicitly define any variables like in the previous examples. However, the loop itself does not modify any variables outside of it. It simply iterates based on the input value.

2. **Determine the Input Value:**
   - The number of iterations is determined by `int(input())`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `first` is `False`, `i` is `3`, and `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for each integer in the range specified by `int(input())`.
   - Since `i` is incremented to `3` after completing all iterations, the loop has already run for the first three iterations.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be at least `4`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The only thing that changes is the input value for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the input value must be `4` or greater for the loop to execute one more time.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `first` is False, `i` is 3, `n` is 4 or greater.**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`first` is False, `i` is 3, `n` is 4 or greater**
