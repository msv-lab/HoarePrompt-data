Output State: **`first` remains False, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the condition to enter the loop or if statement is not met (i.e., `i` which is 1 is not in the keys of `mpp`), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `first` and `i` remain unchanged.
