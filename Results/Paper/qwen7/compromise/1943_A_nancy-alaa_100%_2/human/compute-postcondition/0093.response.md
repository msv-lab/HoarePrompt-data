Output State: `i` is equal to `n` + 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, and `first` remains unchanged.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have incremented to `n + 1`. The initial value of `i` was 3, and since the loop runs from `i` to `n` inclusive, it will continue until `i` reaches `n + 1`. The conditions within the loop do not modify `n` or `first`, so these variables retain their values from the last iteration.
