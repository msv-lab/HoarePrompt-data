Postcondition: **`first` is True, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in `arr`. If `i` is in the keys of `mpp` and `mpp[i]` equals 1, the current value of `first` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If the condition `mpp[i] == 1` is not met, the state remains unchanged.**
