Output State: **`i` is 2, `ans` is 'a[0]a[1] ', `bets` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is currently 1) to the existing value of `ans`. Given that `ans` initially is `'a[0]'` and `i` is 1, `ans` becomes `'a[0]a[1] '`. Also, `i` is incremented implicitly by the way the list index works in the context of the code snippet provided, making `i` equal to 2 now. The condition that `bets` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
