Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[0])`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code increments `i` by 1 (so `i` becomes 1), and then adds the integer value of `a[i]` (which is `a[0]` since `i` is now 1) to `sumo`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
