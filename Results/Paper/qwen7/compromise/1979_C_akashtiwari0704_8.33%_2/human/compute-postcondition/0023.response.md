Output State: **`t` is 0, `bets` is the length of the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`, `sumo` is `sumo + int(a[i])`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sumo` by adding the integer value of `a[i]` to its current value. The other variables (`t`, `bets`, `i`, and `a[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial or last known states.
