Output State: **`t` is 0, `bets` is the length of the list `a`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a`, `sumo` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `sumo = 0` simply initializes the variable `sumo` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `bets`, `i`, `a`, or `prod`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
