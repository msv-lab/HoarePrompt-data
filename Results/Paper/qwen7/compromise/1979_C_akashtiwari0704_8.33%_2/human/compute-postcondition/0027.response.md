Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0.
- `bets` is the length of the list `a`.
- `i` is equal to `bets`.
- Each element in the list `a` has been updated to the result of `prod // a[i]` for its respective index.
- `sumo` is the sum of these updated values, each converted to an integer.
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

The print statement is `print(-1)`. This statement directly prints the integer `-1` without any dependency on the other variables or their values.

Output: **-1**
