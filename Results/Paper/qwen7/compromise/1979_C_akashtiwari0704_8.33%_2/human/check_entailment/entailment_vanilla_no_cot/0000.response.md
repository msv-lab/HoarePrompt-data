Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `prod`**: The variable `prod` is calculated as the product of all multipliers `k_i`. However, the problem requires the total bet to be less than the amount received for each winning outcome, not the product of all multipliers.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking and Printing Bets**: The logic to check if the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome is flawed. It should compare the sum of bets with each individual `k_i * bet`, not just the product of all multipliers.

3. **Handling of Test Cases**: The program reads inputs and processes them in a loop, but it doesn't correctly handle the distribution of bets to ensure the condition is met.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Calculate the total bet and check if it's possible to distribute the bets
        total_bet = 0
        for i in range(bets):
            total_bet += a[i] - 1
        
        if total_bet < min(a):
            ans = [a[i] - 1 for i in range(bets)]
            print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))
        else:
            print(-1)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Calculate Total Bet**: For each outcome, the bet is set to `a[i] - 1` to ensure that the total bet is less than the winnings for that outcome.
2. **Check Feasibility**: Sum up the total bet and check if it is less than the minimum value of `k_i`.
3. **Print Result**: If feasible, print the bets; otherwise, print `-1`.

This approach ensures that the total bet is always less than the winnings for any outcome, satisfying the problem requirements.
