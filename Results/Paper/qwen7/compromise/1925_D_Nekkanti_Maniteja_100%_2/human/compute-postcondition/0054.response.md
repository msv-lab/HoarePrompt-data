Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 6`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007**

The code initializes the variable `M` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is 1000000007. This value does not affect the existing variables `i`, `m`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
