Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, m, k, a_i, b_i, and f_i, where t is an integer between 1 and 50000, n and m are integers with specific ranges, and k, a_i, b_i, and f_i have their own constraints. The function returns information based on the relationships between these variables, specifically focusing on pairs of friends and their connections.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases defined by the variables t, n, m, k, a_i, b_i, and f_i, and processes them according to the given constraints. The exact nature of the return value (e.g., whether it's a list of results, a single value, etc.) isn't specified here, but it would be derived from analyzing the relationships and conditions outlined by these variables.
