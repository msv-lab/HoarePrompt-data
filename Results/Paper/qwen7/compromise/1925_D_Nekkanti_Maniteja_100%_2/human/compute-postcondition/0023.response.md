Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 5, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations, `m` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 3, `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`**.

This means that the value of `s` has been updated according to the formula given in the code. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
