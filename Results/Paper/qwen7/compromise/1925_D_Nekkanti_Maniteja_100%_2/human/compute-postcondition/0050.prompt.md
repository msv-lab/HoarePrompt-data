Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 2`, and all other variables (`s`, `c`, `M`) remain unchanged.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `u` and `v` will hold the values of the first two input integers provided, `f` will hold the value of the third input integer, `a` will be the cumulative sum of all `f` values provided as inputs, `i` will be the total number of iterations plus one, and `m` will be at least equal to the total number of iterations. The variables `s`, `c`, and `M` will retain their initial values since they are not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 2`, `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, and `c`, `M` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is updated to `s + c * (i_prev + 3) * c * m + c * a`, `u` remains the first input integer, `v` remains the second input integer, `f` remains the third input integer, `a` remains the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions, `i` is now `i_prev + 3`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 3`, `c` and `M` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is updated to `s + c * (i_prev + 7) * c * m + c * a`, `u` remains the first input integer, `v` remains the second input integer, `f` remains the third input integer, `a` remains the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions, `i` is now `i_prev + 4`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 4`, `c` and `M` remain unchanged




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
