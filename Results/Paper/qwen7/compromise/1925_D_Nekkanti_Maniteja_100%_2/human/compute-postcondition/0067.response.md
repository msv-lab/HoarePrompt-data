Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 8`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 8`, `u` is the first integer input, `v` is the second integer input, `f` is the third integer input, `a` is increased by `f`, `a` is now `a + f`.**

Explanation: The code `a += f` increments the value of `a` by `f`. The other variables remain unchanged. `i` and `m` retain their initial conditions, and `u`, `v`, and `f` remain as the first, second, and third integer inputs respectively.
