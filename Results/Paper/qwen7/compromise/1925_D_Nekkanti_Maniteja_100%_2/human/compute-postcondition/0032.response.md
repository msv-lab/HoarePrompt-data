Output State: **`s` is 0, `i` is `k + 1`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `a` is 0, `m` must be greater than 2, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the last set of input integers provided, and `k` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations.**

The code `a = 0` sets the variable `a` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
