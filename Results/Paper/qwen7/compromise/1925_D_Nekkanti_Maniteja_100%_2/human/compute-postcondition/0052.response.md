Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `u` is the first input integer.
   - `v` is the second input integer.
   - `f` is the third input integer.
   - `a` is the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions.
   - `i` is `i_prev + 6`.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`.
   - `s` is updated to `s + c * (i_prev + 2) * c * m + c * a + c * (i_prev + 3) * c * m + c * a + c * (i_prev + 7) * c * m + c * a`.
   - `c` and `M` remain unchanged.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to `i_prev + 6` for the next iteration.
   - The new value of `i` should be checked against `int(input())` to determine if the loop can continue.
   - `m` must still be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`.
   - `s` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `c` and `M` remain unchanged.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be `i_prev + 6`.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`.
   - `s` will be updated to include the new term based on the new value of `i`.
   - `c` and `M` remain unchanged.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions, `i` is `i_prev + 6`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`, `s` is updated to `s + c * (i_prev + 2) * c * m + c * a + c * (i_prev + 3) * c * m + c * a + c * (i_prev + 7) * c * m + c * a`, and `c` and `M` remain unchanged.**

However, since we need to focus on the loop head variables, the relevant states to adjust are `i` and `m`:

State: **`i` is `i_prev + 6`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`**.
