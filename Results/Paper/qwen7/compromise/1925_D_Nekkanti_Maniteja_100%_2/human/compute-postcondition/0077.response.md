Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i = i_prev + 18`: This means `i` is 18 more than `i_prev`.
   - `k >= i_prev + 19`: This means `k` is at least 19 more than `i_prev`.
   - `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split. Since their specific values are not provided, we'll keep them as `u`, `v`, and `f`.
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the input over all iterations. Since the number of iterations and the values of `f` are not specified, we'll denote this as `a`.
   - `s` is updated according to the formula: 
     \[
     s = s + c \times (i_prev + 1) \times c \times m + c \times a + c \times (i_prev + 2) \times c \times m + c \times a + \ldots + c \times (i_prev + 17) \times c \times m + c \times a
     \]
     This means `s` is incremented multiple times with the same pattern. Specifically, it increments `s` by:
     \[
     c \times (i_prev + 1) \times c \times m + c \times a
     \]
     17 times, plus the last term:
     \[
     c \times (i_prev + 17) \times c \times m + c \times a
     \]

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(s % M)`. This means we need to find the remainder when `s` is divided by `M`.

Given the above breakdown, let's express the value of `s` more clearly:
\[
s = \sum_{j=1}^{18} \left( c \times (i_prev + j) \times c \times m + c \times a \right)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
s = \sum_{j=1}^{18} \left( c^2 \times (i_prev + j) \times m + c \times a \right)
\]
Expanding this:
\[
s = c^2 \times m \times \sum_{j=1}^{18} (i_prev + j) + 18 \times c \times a
\]
The sum inside can be further broken down:
\[
\sum_{j=1}^{18} (i_prev + j) = 18 \times i_prev + \sum_{j=1}^{18} j = 18 \times i_prev + \frac{18 \times 19}{2} = 18 \times i_prev + 171
\]
So:
\[
s = c^2 \times m \times (18 \times i_prev + 171) + 18 \times c \times a
\]

Finally, the print statement will output the remainder of `s` when divided by `M`:
\[
\text{Output: } (c^2 \times m \times (18 \times i_prev + 171) + 18 \times c \times a) \% M
\]
