Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is `k + 1`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is updated to include the final addition of `c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations, `m` must be greater than 2, `u`, `v`, and `f` are the last set of input integers provided, and `k` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations; `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into three integers, `M` is now explicitly set to 1000000007.**

Explanation: The code only sets `M` to 1000000007, which does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`, `m`, `u`, `v`, `f`, `n`, `k` remain as they were in the initial state, with the additional information that `M` is now explicitly set to 1000000007.
