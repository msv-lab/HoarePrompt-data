Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `i` is 0, `M` is 1000000007, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The line `M = 10 ** 9 + 7` assigns the value `1000000007` to the variable `M`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
