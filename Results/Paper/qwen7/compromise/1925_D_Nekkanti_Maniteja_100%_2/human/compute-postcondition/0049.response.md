Output State: **`s` is updated to `s + c * (i_prev + 7) * c * m + c * a`, `u` remains the first input integer, `v` remains the second input integer, `f` remains the third input integer, `a` remains the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions, `i` is now `i_prev + 4`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 4`, `c` and `M` remain unchanged**.

Explanation: The code updates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Given that `i` is now `i_prev + 4`, the new value of `i` is used in the calculation. Thus, the term `c * i * c * m` becomes `c * (i_prev + 4) * c * m`. Combining this with the original term `c * (i_prev + 3) * c * m + c * a`, the new value of `s` becomes `s + c * (i_prev + 7) * c * m + c * a`. All other variables (`u`, `v`, `f`, `a`, `m`, `c`, and `M`) remain unchanged as per the precondition.
