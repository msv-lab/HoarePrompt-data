Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 6`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `(n * (n - 1)) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0.**

The code initializes `s` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `m`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `s` is set to 0.
