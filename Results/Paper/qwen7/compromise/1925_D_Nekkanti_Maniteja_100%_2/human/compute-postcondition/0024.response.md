Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration `i` from 3 to `k-1`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations, `m` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is the total number of iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the given bounds, `i` will be equal to the total number of iterations (`k`), `M` stays constant at 1000000007, `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is the cumulative sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration `i` from 3 to `k-1`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations, `m` must be greater than 2, and `u`, `v`, and `f` are the last set of input integers provided.
