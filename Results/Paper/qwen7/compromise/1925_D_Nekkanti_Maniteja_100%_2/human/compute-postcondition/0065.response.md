Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i_prev + 7`
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 7`
   - `u` is the first integer input
   - `v` is the second integer input
   - `f` is the third integer input
   - `a` is increased by `f`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < m`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 7`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `(i_prev + 7) + 1 = i_prev + 8`.
   - Therefore, `m` must still be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 8`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be `i_prev + 8`.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 8`.
   - The values of `u`, `v`, `f`, and `a` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i_prev + 8`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 8`, `u` is the first integer input, `v` is the second integer input, `f` is the third integer input, `a` is increased by `f`**.
