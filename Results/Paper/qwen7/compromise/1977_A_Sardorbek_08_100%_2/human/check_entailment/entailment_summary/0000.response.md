Reasoning:
- The program is designed to process multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \( b \) and \( c \).
- The program correctly initializes the number of test cases \( a \) and iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, the program checks several conditions to determine the appropriate output:
  - If \( b \) (number of moves) equals \( c \) (desired number of cubes), it prints 'YES'.
  - If \( b \) is less than \( c \), it prints 'NO' because it's not possible to end up with more cubes than moves.
  - If \( b \) and \( c \) have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'Yes'.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the examples provided in the problem statement:
- For the first test case (3 3): Since \( b = 3 \) and \( c = 3 \), the condition \( b = c \) is true, so the output should be 'YES'.
- For the second test case (2 4): Since \( b = 2 \) and \( c = 4 \), \( b < c \) is true, so the output should be 'NO'.
- For the third test case (5 3): Since \( b = 5 \) and \( c = 3 \), \( b \) and \( c \) have different parities, so the output should be 'NO'.

The program logic matches the expected outputs for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
