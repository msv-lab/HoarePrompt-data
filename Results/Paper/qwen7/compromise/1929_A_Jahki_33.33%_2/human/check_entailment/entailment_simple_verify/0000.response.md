### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Analysis of `func_1` Function:
- The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
- It returns `True` if the array is sorted, meaning no rearrangement is needed, and the program prints `0`.
- This function is not designed to find the maximum beauty; it only checks if the array is already in a non-decreasing order.

#### Main Logic:
- The main logic sorts the array and calculates the beauty using the sorted array.
- Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which is not necessarily the optimal way to maximize the beauty.

#### Example Analysis:
- Consider the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`.
  - Sorting the array gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`.
  - The beauty calculated is `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`.
  - However, the optimal arrangement to maximize beauty is `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, which also results in a beauty of `57`.

- Consider another input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]` with a different optimal arrangement.
  - The optimal arrangement could be `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, which results in a beauty of `57`.
  - Sorting the array and calculating the beauty using the sorted array still gives the correct result.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty when the array is already sorted or when the optimal arrangement is achieved by sorting.
- The program does not need to check if the array is sorted because sorting the array inherently maximizes the beauty.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program does indeed correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic of sorting the array and then calculating the beauty is valid and works for all test cases provided.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
