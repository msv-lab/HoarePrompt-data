Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the `func_1` function and how the main logic is implemented.

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns `True`, which means no rearrangement is needed, and the program prints `0`. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty.
   - For example, consider the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. The function `func_1` would return `False` because the array is not sorted, but the correct rearrangement to maximize beauty would be `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, resulting in a beauty of `57`.

2. **Incorrect Main Logic:**
   - The main logic sorts the array and calculates the beauty using the sorted array. This approach might not always yield the maximum beauty. For instance, in the example `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, but the correct rearrangement is `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, which results in a beauty of `57`.
   - A more effective approach would involve finding the minimum and maximum values and arranging them optimally to maximize the sum of differences.

To fix the program, you need to implement a different strategy to find the maximum beauty, such as:
- Finding the minimum and maximum values and placing them at the ends of the array.
- Ensuring the array is arranged in a way that maximizes the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
