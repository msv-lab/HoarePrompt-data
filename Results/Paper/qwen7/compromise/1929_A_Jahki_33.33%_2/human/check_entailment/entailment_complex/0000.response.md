### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \( a \) by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and calculate the beauty using the sorted array. This is because the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - This function is not necessary for solving the problem correctly, as the main logic can be implemented directly without needing this check.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The annotated program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - This approach is correct because sorting ensures that the differences are maximized.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like identical elements (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`) correctly by returning 0.
   - It also handles cases where the array is already sorted or nearly sorted.

6. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty.
   - The use of `func_1` is redundant and does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and follows the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the beauty as required.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
