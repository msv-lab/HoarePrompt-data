Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
2. The given solution attempts to sort the array and then calculate the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements.
3. The `func_1` function checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating no rearrangement is needed. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
4. If `func_1` returns `True`, the code prints `0` because the array is already in the optimal order.
5. If `func_1` returns `False`, the array is sorted, and the beauty is calculated by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
6. Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

Given this analysis, the logic in the program is sound. It correctly identifies whether the array is already in the optimal order and calculates the maximum beauty accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
