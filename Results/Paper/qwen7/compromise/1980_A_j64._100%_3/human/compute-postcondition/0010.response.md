Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (the length of the string `a`), m (the minimum frequency required for each character), and a (a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). It calculates and returns the total number of additional problems needed to ensure each character in the string `a` appears at least m times.**
