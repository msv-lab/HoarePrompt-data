Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the number of rounds `m`, and the string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems. It then calls the function `func_1` to calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed.

The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level and calculates how many more problems are needed for each difficulty level to ensure there are at least `m` problems for each difficulty level. The sum of these additional problems gives the total number of problems that need to be created.

Given the problem constraints and the example provided, the program produces the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
