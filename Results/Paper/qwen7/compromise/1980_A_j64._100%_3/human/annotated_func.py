#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `count` is a list of 7 integers representing the frequency of each character ('A' to 'G') in the string `a`. The values in `count` correspond to the number of times each character appears in `a`. `n` is the length of the string `a`, and `m` remains unchanged.
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
        
    #State: Output State: count is a list of 7 integers where each integer is at least m, needed_problems is the total number of additional problems needed to make each character count at least m.
    return needed_problems
    #The program returns needed_problems which is the total number of additional problems needed to make each character count in the list 'count' at least m.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: n (the length of the string `a`), m (the minimum frequency required for each character), and a (a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). It calculates and returns the total number of additional problems needed to ensure each character in the string `a` appears at least m times.
