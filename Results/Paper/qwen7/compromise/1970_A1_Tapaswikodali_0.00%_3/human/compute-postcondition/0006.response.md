Output State: **`s` is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `balance` is 0; `details` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains the current value of `balance`, the negative index of the character in `s`, and the character itself.**

Explanation: The `details.sort()` command sorts the `details` list in ascending order based on the first element of each tuple (which represents the balance). The sorting does not change the values of `s`, `balance`, or the content of `details` except for their order. Therefore, `s` remains a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence, `balance` remains 0, and `details` becomes a sorted list of tuples as described.
