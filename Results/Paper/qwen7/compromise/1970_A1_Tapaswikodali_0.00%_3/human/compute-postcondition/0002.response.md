Output State: **`s` is an input string of a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `balance` is 0; `details` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `details`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `balance`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `s` and `balance`, while adding the new variable `details` which is now an empty list.
