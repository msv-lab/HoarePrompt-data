### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given examples.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube.
   - The key observation is that the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` plays a crucial role. If `n` is even, `m` must also be even. If `n` is odd, `m` can be either even or odd, but it must be close to `n/2`.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes two integers `n` and `m` and prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, otherwise it prints 'No'.
   - This summary is misleading because it does not capture the full logic needed to solve the problem.

3. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads `n` and `m`, and prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, otherwise it prints 'No'.

4. **Examples and Correctness**:
   - **Example 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`. The program prints 'Yes', which is correct.
   - **Example 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`. The program prints 'No', which is correct.
   - **Example 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`. The program prints 'Yes', which is incorrect according to the original assessment.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - To correctly determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to consider the parity of `n` and `m`.
   - If `n` is even, `m` must also be even.
   - If `n` is odd, `m` can be either even or odd, but it must be close to `n/2`.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The current implementation is indeed incorrect because it does not account for the specific conditions related to the parity of `n` and `m`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the conditions based on the parity of `n` and `m`.
