Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly describes the behavior of the given code.
- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.
- Within `func_1()`, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.
- It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
- The logic in `func_1()` matches the problem statement perfectly. If `n` (number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (desired number of cubes), it's possible to achieve the desired state. Otherwise, it's not possible.
- There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
