Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, n is an input integer, m is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100.
