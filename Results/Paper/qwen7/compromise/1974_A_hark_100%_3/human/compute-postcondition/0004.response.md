Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case consists of two non-negative integers x and y, and a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation on x and y and returns the result for each test case.**

Note: The specific operation on x and y is not detailed in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the structure and input constraints of the function.
