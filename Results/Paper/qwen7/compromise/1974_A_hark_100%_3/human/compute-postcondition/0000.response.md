Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `ap = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `ap`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, still being a positive integer within the specified range.
