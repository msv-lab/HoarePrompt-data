Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    string = input()
    s = list(string)
    n = len(s)
    done = False
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        continue
    x = s[0]
    if x != s[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        continue
    if s.count(x) == n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
        if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        continue
    count = 0
    count2 = 0
    for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
        if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            done = True
            break
        if s[j] != x and count < 1:
            count = j
        if count > 0:
            if s[j] != x:
                if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
                elif count2 == count:
                    if count > 1:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                        done = True
                        break
                    else:
                        count2 = 0
                        continue
                elif count2 > count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
            else:
                count2 += 1
    if not done:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is 1, `done` is `True`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 1, `j` is 0. The loop has successfully executed without finding any mismatched pairs of characters.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: All variables remain unchanged except for `done` which is set to `True`. `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, and `count` which is equal to `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `done` remains `False` or becomes `True`, `i` is incremented by 1 (final value is `i_final`), `j` is the last value in the sequence (either 0 or 1), `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is either 1, 2, or equal to `count`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
