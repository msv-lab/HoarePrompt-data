Output State: **`i` is 1, `string` is a new input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `x` is the first character of `s`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is `False`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 1, `j` is 0, we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since no specific changes are made to any variables and the loop continues, all the variables retain their previous values.
