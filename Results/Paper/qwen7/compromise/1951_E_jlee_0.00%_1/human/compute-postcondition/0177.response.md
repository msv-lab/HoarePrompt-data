Postcondition: `done` is `True`, `i` is `0`, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is `1`, `count` is `0`, `count2` is either `0` or `1`, `j` is `0. If `count2` is equal to `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count` is greater than `1`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
