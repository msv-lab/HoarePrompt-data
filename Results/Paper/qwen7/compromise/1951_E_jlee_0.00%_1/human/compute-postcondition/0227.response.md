Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string such that if the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`, `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the characters are equal, no changes are made to `done` and the conditions remain as they were.**
