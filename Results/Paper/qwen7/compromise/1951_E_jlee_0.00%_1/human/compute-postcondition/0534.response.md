Output State: **`done` remains `False`, `i` is incremented by 1 (new value is `i_new`), `j` is the next value in the sequence (either 0 or 1), `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is either 1, 2, or equal to `count`, `s` is a list representation of the string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, `count2` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the variable `count2` has been incremented by 1. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
