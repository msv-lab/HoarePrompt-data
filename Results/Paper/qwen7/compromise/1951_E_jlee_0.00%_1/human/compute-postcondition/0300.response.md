Output State: **`done` is set to `True`, `count` is either equal to `j` or greater than 0, `s[j]` remains not equal to `x`, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `done = True` sets the variable `done` to `True`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
