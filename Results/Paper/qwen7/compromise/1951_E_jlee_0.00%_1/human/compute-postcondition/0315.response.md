Postcondition: `s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `done` is set to `True`, `count` is either equal to `j` or greater than 0, `s[j]` remains not equal to `x`, and if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If none of these conditions are met, `count2` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
