Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` but does not affect `t` or the list `a`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains unchanged, and the list `a` is still a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n`, inclusive.
