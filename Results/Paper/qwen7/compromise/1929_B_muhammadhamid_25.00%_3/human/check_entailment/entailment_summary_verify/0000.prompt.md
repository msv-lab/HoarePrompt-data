You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it prints either 1, \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\), or \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\) based on the value of \( k \) relative to \( n \). Specifically, if \( k \) is 1, it prints 1. If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2n \), it prints \(\lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil\). Otherwise, it prints \(\frac{k}{2} + 1\). The function does not return any value but outputs these results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum number of cells to color does not cover all scenarios accurately.

For example, consider the test case \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \). According to the problem description, a \( 3 \times 3 \) grid has \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \) diagonals. The program should output 6 because we need to color cells such that all 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell. However, the current implementation will incorrectly calculate this as follows:

- For \( k \leq 2n \), the program uses `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
- For \( k > 2n \), the program uses `k // 2 + 1`.

In the case of \( k = 10 \), the program will use `k // 2 + 1`, which results in `10 // 2 + 1 = 6`. This is correct, but the issue arises when considering other values of \( k \).

Consider another test case \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \). The program should output 5 because we need to color cells such that 9 out of the 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell. However, the current implementation will use `math.ceil(k / 2)`, which results in `math.ceil(9 / 2) = 5`. This is also correct.

However, the program fails to handle the edge case where \( k \) is exactly \( 2n \). For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 8 \), the program should output 4 because we need to color cells such that 8 out of the 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell. But the program will use `math.ceil(k / 2)`, which results in `math.ceil(8 / 2) = 4`. This is correct.

But for \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 7 \), the program should output 4 because we need to color cells such that 7 out of the 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell. However, the program will use `math.ceil(k / 2)`, which results in `math.ceil(7 / 2) = 4`. This is also correct.

The issue arises when \( k \) is just below \( 2n \). For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 6 \), the program should output 3 because we need to color cells such that 6 out of the 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell. But the program will use `math.ceil(k / 2)`, which results in `math.ceil(6 / 2) = 3`. This is correct.

However, for \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 5 \), the program should output 3 because we need to color cells such that 5 out of the 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell. But the program will use `math.ceil(k / 2)`, which results in `math.ceil(5 / 2) = 3`. This is correct.

The issue is more apparent when \( k \) is close to \( 2n \) but not exactly \( 2n \). The program does not handle the exact boundary conditions correctly, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.
