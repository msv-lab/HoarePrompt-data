Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k` for each case.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `k == 1`, the program prints `1`. This is correct because, in the worst case, we need to color just one cell to satisfy the condition of having at least one colored diagonal.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - For `k > 1`, the program checks if `k <= 2 * n`.
     - If true, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
     - If false, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Special Case: \( k == 1 \)
- This case is handled correctly. For example, if \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), we need to color just one cell to ensure at least one diagonal is colored.

#### General Case: \( k > 1 \)
- **Condition Check**: `if k <= 2 * n`
  - This condition is necessary because for any \( n \times n \) grid, there are at most \( 2n \) diagonals running from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left.
  - If \( k \leq 2n \), coloring \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) cells will ensure that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
  - This works because each cell can contribute to up to 2 diagonals (one from each direction).

- **Else Condition**: `else: print(k // 2 + 1)`
  - If \( k > 2n \), the logic ensures that we color enough cells to cover all required diagonals.
  - The formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) is derived from the observation that after coloring \( 2n \) cells, we still need additional cells to cover the remaining diagonals.
  - This formula ensures that we account for the extra diagonals beyond \( 2n \).

### Example Verification

Let's verify the solution with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
  - Correct answer: 2

- **Test Case 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
  - Correct answer: 2

- **Test Case 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)
  - \( 2n = 6 \), \( k > 2n \)
  - \( \frac{10}{2} + 1 = 6 \)
  - Correct answer: 6

- **Test Case 4**: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)
  - \( 2n = 6 \), \( k > 2n \)
  - \( \frac{9}{2} + 1 = 5 \)
  - Correct answer: 5

- **Test Case 5**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)
  - \( 2n = 8 \), \( k < 2n \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{7}{2} \rceil = 4 \)
  - Correct answer: 4

- **Test Case 6**: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)
  - \( 2n = 14 \), \( k < 2n \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{11}{2} \rceil = 6 \)
  - Correct answer: 6

- **Test Case 7**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - \( 2n = 4 \), \( k < 2n \)
  - \( \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 \)
  - Correct answer: 2
