Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it correctly calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.

1. **Case when \( k = 1 \)**:
   - The program prints `1`. This is correct because, in this case, Sasha needs to color just one cell to satisfy the condition of having at least one colored cell in one diagonal.

2. **Case when \( k \leq 2n \)**:
   - The program prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because each diagonal in an \( n \times n \) grid can be paired with another diagonal such that coloring one cell in one diagonal satisfies the condition for both diagonals. Thus, the minimum number of cells needed is `math.ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Case when \( k > 2n \)**:
   - The program prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is also correct because after coloring cells according to the pairing logic up to \( 2n \) diagonals, any additional diagonals beyond \( 2n \) will require at least one more cell to be colored. Since each additional diagonal needs one new cell, the formula `k // 2 + 1` correctly accounts for this.

Given these points, the program logic matches the problem requirements and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
