Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 1, \(\text{math.ceil}(k/2)\), or \(\text{k} // 2 + 1\), depending on the value of \(k\) relative to \(2n\). Each line corresponds to the output of one test case within the loop, where the values of \(n\) and \(k\) are provided as inputs for each test case.
