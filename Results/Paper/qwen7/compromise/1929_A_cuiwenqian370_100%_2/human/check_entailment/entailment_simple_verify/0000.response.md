### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
The goal is to find the maximum possible beauty of an array \(a\) by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

#### Key Points:
1. **Sorting Approach**: The current implementation (`func_1`) sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty because it only considers the relative order after sorting.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: To maximize the beauty, we should place the smallest element at the start and the largest at the end, and then alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements. This strategy ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

#### Analysis of Given Code:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - Sorts the array.
  - Calculates the beauty as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
  - This approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Reads input from standard input.
  - Calls `func_1` for each test case and stores the results.
  - Prints the results.

#### Correctness of the Given Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty. However, the provided solution does not actually implement the optimal strategy mentioned above. Instead, it still uses sorting, which means it might not achieve the maximum beauty in some cases.

To verify this, let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- **Input**: `3 4 1 2`
- **Expected Output**: By sorting and calculating, the output should be `5` (since the beauty is calculated as `(4-3) + (1-4) + (2-1) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5`).
- **Actual Output**: The program sorts the array and calculates the beauty as `(1-4) + (2-1) + (3-2) = -3 + 1 + 1 = -1`, which is incorrect.

This example clearly shows that the current implementation is flawed. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the optimal strategy to maximize the beauty of the array. Sorting the array does not guarantee the maximum beauty, and the provided example demonstrates this flaw.
