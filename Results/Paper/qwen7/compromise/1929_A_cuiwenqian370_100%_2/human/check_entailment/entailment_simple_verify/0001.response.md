### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is solving the problem accurately. Let's break down the key points and verify them step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, thereby maximizing the positive differences.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and computing the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - This approach is correct because sorting the array ensures that the differences are maximized.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.
   - The logic for reading and processing input is correct.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: Input `[2, 1, 3]` -> Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]` -> Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`
   - **Example 2**: Input `[69, 69, 69]` -> Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]` -> Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0`
   - **Example 3**: Input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]` -> Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` -> Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`
   - **Example 4**: Input `[3, 4, 3, 3]` -> Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]` -> Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
   - **Example 5**: Input `[2, 1]` -> Sorted: `[1, 2]` -> Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`

All the examples provided in the original assessment match the expected outputs, confirming that the program is working as intended.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis and verification, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly solves the problem by sorting the array and calculating the beauty using the sorted array. It also correctly handles multiple test cases.

**Final: True**
