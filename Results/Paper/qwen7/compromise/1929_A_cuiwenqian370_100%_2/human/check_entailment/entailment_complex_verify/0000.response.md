### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program is incorrect.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum possible beauty of the array \(a\) by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- Sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty because the beauty depends on the arrangement of elements, not just their relative order.

#### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the input:
```
3
4 1 3 2
```

- If we sort the array, we get \([1, 2, 3, 4]\).
- The beauty calculated by `func_1` is:
  \[
  |2-1| + |3-2| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
  \]
- However, the optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty is \([4, 1, 3, 2]\), which gives:
  \[
  |1-4| + |3-1| + |2-3| = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
  \]

This example clearly shows that sorting the array does not always yield the maximum beauty. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. The function `func_1` sorts the array, which does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty.
