Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and the input reading process is switched to reading from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`.**

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` changes the `input` function to read all input at once from standard input (like a file), instead of reading line by line. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or the `array` for each test case, but it does change how the input will be processed. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and the `array` remain the same as per the precondition, but the method of input reading is altered.
