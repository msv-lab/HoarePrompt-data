Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum balance of the problemset. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the maximum balance. Specifically, the program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` and `i`, but it does not ensure that the sum of the difficulties equals `x`. 

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  10 3
  12 4
  20 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  3
  4
  ```

- Actual Output (using the given program):
  ```
  2
  3
  4
  ```

While the output seems correct for these specific cases, the program's logic is flawed. For example, in the case of `x = 12` and `n = 4`, the program correctly outputs `3` because the difficulties could be `3, 3, 3, 3`. However, the program might fail for other inputs where the optimal solution involves more complex factor combinations.

A correct approach would involve finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `n`, which ensures the balance is maximized while maintaining the sum of difficulties equal to `x`. The current implementation does not guarantee this optimal solution for all cases.
