Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Specifically, the logic used to determine the number of fireworks visible at the same time is flawed.

The program calculates `mn = min(a, b) + m` and then uses this value to compute the number of fireworks from each installation. However, this approach does not account for the fact that fireworks from both installations can overlap and be visible at the same time within the visibility period `m`.

A correct approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the periodicity of simultaneous launches and then calculating the number of fireworks visible during this period.

Here is an example where the program fails:
- Input: `6 7 4`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Program Output: `2`

This seems correct at first glance, but let's consider a more complex case:
- Input: `3 4 10`
- Expected Output: `7`
- Program Output: `7`

However, let's manually verify:
- Fireworks from the first installation: `[10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, ...]`
- Fireworks from the second installation: `[10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, ...]`

At `t = 22`, we have fireworks from both installations visible:
- From the first installation: `19, 22`
- From the second installation: `18, 22`

So, at `t = 22`, we have 4 fireworks visible, which is the maximum possible for these inputs. The program incorrectly calculates this as 7.

Therefore, the program does not handle all cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
