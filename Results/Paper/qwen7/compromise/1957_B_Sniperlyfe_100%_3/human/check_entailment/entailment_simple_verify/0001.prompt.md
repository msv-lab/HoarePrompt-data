You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` where `nums[0]` is (1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1, and for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is equal to `k` if `k > 0` and 1 otherwise, with `k` being 0 after the loop finishes.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where `nums[0]` is (1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1 + `k`. For all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is equal to `k` if `k > 0` and 1 otherwise, with `k` being 0 after the loop finishes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to generate an array `nums` of length `n` such that the sum of elements equals `k` and the bitwise OR of the elements is maximized.
   - The function initializes `nums` with zeros.
   - It sets `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits (i.e., `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1`).
   - It then reduces `k` by this value.
   - For each subsequent element, it tries to add the smallest possible value (`min(nums[0] + 1, k)`), ensuring the sum condition is met.
   - Finally, it adjusts `nums[0]` to account for any remaining value of `k`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - For each test case, the program calls `func_1(n, k)` and stores the result.
   - It then prints the result for each test case.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Initialization of `nums[0]`:**
   - Setting `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` ensures that the first element is the largest possible number with `k.bit_length()` bits. This helps maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.

2. **Subsequent Elements:**
   - The loop for `i` from 1 to `n-1` ensures that each subsequent element is set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k`. This helps distribute the remaining sum while keeping the bitwise OR value high.

3. **Final Adjustment:**
   - Adjusting `nums[0]` to account for any remaining value of `k` ensures that the sum constraint is met.

### Testing the Function:

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `1 5`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Explanation: `5` is the largest number with `1` bit, so `nums[0] = 5` and the sum is `5`.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `2 3`
  - Expected Output: `1 2`
  - Explanation: `1 | 2 = 3` and `1 + 2 = 3`. The bitwise OR is `3` (binary `11`), which is maximized.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `2 5`
  - Expected Output: `5 0`
  - Explanation: `5 | 0 = 5` and `5 + 0 = 5`. The bitwise OR is `5` (binary `101`), which is maximized.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `6 51`
  - Expected Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12`
  - Explanation: `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 37` (binary `100101`), which is maximized.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation while ensuring the sum constraint is met. Therefore, the program is correct.
