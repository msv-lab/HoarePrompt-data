Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated input, `q` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated input, `t` is a positive integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `q` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the placeholders for `n` and `q` in the initial state. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
