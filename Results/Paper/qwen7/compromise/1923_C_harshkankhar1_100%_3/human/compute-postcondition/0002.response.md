Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated input, `q` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated input, `t` is a positive integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from the next input split into a list, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `n`, `q`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
