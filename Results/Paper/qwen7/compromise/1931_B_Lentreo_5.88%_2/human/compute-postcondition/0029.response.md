Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers entered by the user, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the last element of `nums` (`last`), if `curr` equals 0, it remains 0; otherwise, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the last element of `nums` (`last`), and `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a list of integers from the user input and stores it in the variable `nums`. The values of `curr`, `t`, and `n` are not directly modified by this code. Therefore, the initial conditions for these variables remain unchanged. The only new information introduced is that `nums` now contains the list of integers provided by the user.
