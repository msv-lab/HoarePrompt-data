Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user, `last` is the last element of the list `nums`, `curr` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `curr` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, or `last`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
