Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` will hold the integer value entered by the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet.
