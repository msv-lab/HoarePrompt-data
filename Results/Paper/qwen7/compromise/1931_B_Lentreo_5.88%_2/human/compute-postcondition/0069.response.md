Output State: **`nums` is a list with at least one element (excluding the first element of the previous iteration), `i` is the third element of the original `nums`, `curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last` if `i` is not 0, and if `i` is 0, `curr` remains unchanged.**

In more detail, the code updates the variable `curr` by adding the value of `i` (which is the third element of the original `nums`) minus the value of `last`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated accordingly; otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged. The other variables and their conditions remain as described in the initial state.
