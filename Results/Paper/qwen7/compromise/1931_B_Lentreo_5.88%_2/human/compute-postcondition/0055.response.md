Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input from the user, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, splits the line into individual elements, and then converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `nums`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
