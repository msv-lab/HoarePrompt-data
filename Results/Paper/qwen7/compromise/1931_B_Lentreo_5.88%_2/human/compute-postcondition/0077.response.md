Postcondition: **After executing the if-else block, `nums` is an empty list, `i` does not exist because the loop has completed, and `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the original `nums` list where each element is subtracted by the corresponding `last` value from the previous iteration. If `curr` equals 0, the function does nothing. Otherwise, `curr` remains as the sum calculated.**
