Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the program checks if the difference between the last element and other elements is zero, which is not sufficient to determine the possibility of equalizing the water in all containers.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
The program will output "YES" because it checks the difference between the last element and others, but the correct approach would involve checking if the average of the elements can be achieved by pouring water between containers. In this case, the average is `(4 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3) / 5 = 3`, and it is not possible to make all containers have exactly 3 units of water using the allowed operations.

A correct solution would involve checking if the sum of the elements is divisible by `n` and then verifying if the average can be achieved through the operations. However, the current implementation does not account for these necessary steps.
