Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of non-negative integers, where the length of the list `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the function does not take any explicit parameters but operates within the constraints that the sum of all elements in `a` across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. The function returns nothing explicitly, but it processes the list `a` under the given constraints.**

This means the function `func_1` takes a list of non-negative integers as its input, adheres to specific constraints on the length and values of the list elements, and processes this list without returning any value directly.
