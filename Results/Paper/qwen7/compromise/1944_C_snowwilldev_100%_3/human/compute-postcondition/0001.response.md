Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `N` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, and the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

In this output state, the variable `a` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from the input, which is split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t`, `N`, and the constraint on `n` remain unchanged. The constraint on the sum of all `n` values across all test cases also remains valid.
