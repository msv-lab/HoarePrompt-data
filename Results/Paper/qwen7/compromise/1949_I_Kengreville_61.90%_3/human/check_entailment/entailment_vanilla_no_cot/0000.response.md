Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Missing `dfs` function call**: The `dfs` function is defined but never called in the `func_1` function. This means the graph traversal logic will not run, and the algorithm will not explore the connections between the disks properly.

2. **Incorrect logic in `dfs` function**: The `dfs` function does not correctly update the coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) for the linear system that needs to be solved. The logic for updating these coefficients should ensure that the tangency condition is maintained while allowing the sum of radii to decrease.

3. **Incorrect termination condition**: The `ok` variable is set to `True` if any node is visited, which is not sufficient to determine if the problem constraints can be met. The algorithm needs to check if it's possible to find a valid assignment of new radii that satisfies the conditions.

4. **Lack of actual radius adjustment logic**: The code does not implement the logic to adjust the radii in a way that ensures the sum of radii decreases while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Use a graph representation where each disk is a node and edges represent tangency.
- Solve a system of linear equations to find the new radii values.
- Ensure that the sum of the new radii is less than the original sum while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions.

Here is a high-level outline of how you might approach the problem correctly:

1. **Graph Construction**: Build a graph where each disk is a node and edges represent tangency.
2. **Linear System Setup**: Set up a linear system of equations to represent the tangency conditions.
3. **Solve Linear System**: Solve the system to find new radii values.
4. **Check Conditions**: Verify that the new radii satisfy the conditions of decreasing the sum of radii and maintaining tangency and non-overlapping.

Given the complexity, a full implementation would require more detailed steps and proper handling of the linear algebra involved.
