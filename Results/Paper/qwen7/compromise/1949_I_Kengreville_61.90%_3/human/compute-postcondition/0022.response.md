Output State: **`dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `j` is `j + 2`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j + 1]`, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `coef0[j]` to be `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`. The values of `dx`, `j`, `dy`, and `coef0[i]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
