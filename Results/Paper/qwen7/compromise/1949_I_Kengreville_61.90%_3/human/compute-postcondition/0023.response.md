Output State: **`dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`, `j` is `j + 2`, `dy` is `y[i] - y[j + 1]`, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `-coef1[i]` to `coef1[j]`. The other variables (`dx`, `j`, `dy`, `coef0[j]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
