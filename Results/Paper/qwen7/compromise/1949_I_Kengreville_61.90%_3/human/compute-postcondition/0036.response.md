Output State: **`c0` is the sum of `coef0[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of `coef1[j]` for all `j` in `nodes`, `ok` is True if `ok` was True or `c1` is not equal to 0, otherwise `ok` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `ok = ok or c1 != 0` checks if `c1` is not equal to 0. If `c1` is not 0, `ok` will be set to True regardless of its previous value. If `c1` is 0, `ok` will remain unchanged. Since the exact value of `ok` before this operation is not specified, we only know that `ok` will be True if `c1` is not 0, otherwise it stays as it was.
