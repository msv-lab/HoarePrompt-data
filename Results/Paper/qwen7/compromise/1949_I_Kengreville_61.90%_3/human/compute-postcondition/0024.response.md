Output State: **`j` is `j + 2`, `dfs(j)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `dfs(j)` calls the function `dfs` with the argument `j`. The value of `j` is updated to `j + 2` before the call, but the actual value of `j` after the call remains unspecified since the function `dfs` does not return any value or modify `j` further. The other variables (`dx`, `dy`, `coef0[j]`, `coef1[j]`) remain unchanged.
