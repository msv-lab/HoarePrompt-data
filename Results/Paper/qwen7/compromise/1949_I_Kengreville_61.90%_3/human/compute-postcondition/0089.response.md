Functionality: **The function processes a set of disks defined by their x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii. It uses depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the disks and calculates coefficients for each disk. If any unvisited disk has a non-zero sum of specific coefficients, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
