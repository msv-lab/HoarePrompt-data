Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `n`, `nodes` will be an empty list, `c0` will be 0, `c1` will be 0, and `ok` will be `True` if any `visited[i]` is `False` and `c1` is not 0 for those iterations where `visited[i]` is `False`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have reached `n`, indicating that every index from `0` to `n-1` has been processed. The lists `nodes`, `c0`, and `c1` will all be reset to their initial states (empty list, 0, and 0 respectively). The variable `ok` will be `True` if `ok` was `True` initially or if `c1` was not 0 for any iteration where `visited[i]` was `False`.
