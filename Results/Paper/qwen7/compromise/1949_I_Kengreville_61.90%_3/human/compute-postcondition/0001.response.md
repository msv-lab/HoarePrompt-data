Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` is a list of integers representing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `y` is a list of integers representing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `r` is a list of integers representing the radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited or not, and `visited[i]` is now True.**

In this output state, the value of `visited[i]` has been updated to `True`, indicating that the i-th disk has been visited. All other variables retain their initial values or conditions.
