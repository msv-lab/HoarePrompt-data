Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in nodes:`. The only object here is `j` and `nodes`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j` and `nodes`**:
   - `j` is the variable that will iterate over the elements in `nodes`.
   - `nodes` is a list that contains the elements to be iterated over.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `nodes` must contain at least one element. If `nodes` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `nodes` is an empty list initially, we need to ensure that `nodes` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `j` will change during each iteration, but we don't need to specify its initial value because it will be assigned the first element of `nodes` when the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `nodes` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`nodes` is an empty list that must have at least one element**.
