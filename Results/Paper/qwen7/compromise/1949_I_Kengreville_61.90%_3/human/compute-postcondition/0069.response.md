Output State: **`nodes` must contain at least one element; `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]'**

In this step, the value of `c1` is incremented by `coef1[j]`. The value of `nodes` remains unchanged as it was mentioned to contain at least one element initially and no operation was performed on it. The value of `c0` was increased by `coef0[j]` before this line of code, but it is not affected by the current line.
