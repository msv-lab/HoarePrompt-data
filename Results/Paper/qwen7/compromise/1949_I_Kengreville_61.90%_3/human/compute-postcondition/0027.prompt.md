Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nodes` is a list containing the integer `i`; `visited[i]` is now True; `n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` is a list of integers representing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `y` is a list of integers representing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `r` is a list of integers representing the radii of the disks.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    dx = x[i] - x[j]
    dy = y[i] - y[j]
    if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
        coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
        coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
        dfs(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0; `dx` is `x[i] - x[0]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[0]`; if `visited[j]` is false and the distance condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` is met, then `visited[j]` is true, `coef0[j]` is `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, and `coef1[j]` is `-coef1[i]`. If the condition is not met, the values of `visited[j]`, `coef0[j]`, and `coef1[j]` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `dx` is `x[i] - x[j]`; `dy` is `y[i] - y[j]`; if `visited[j]` is false and the distance condition `(r[i] + r[j])^2 == dx^2 + dy^2` is met, then `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`, and the `dfs` function is called with argument `j`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is incremented by 2 and `dfs(j)` is called if `j` is not visited and the distance condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged and `j + 2` is updated.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
