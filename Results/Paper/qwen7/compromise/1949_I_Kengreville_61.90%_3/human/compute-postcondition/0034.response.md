Output State: **`c0` is `coef0[j+1] + coef0[j+1] + coef0[j]`, `c1` is `coef1[j+1] + coef1[j+1] + coef1[j]`, `j` is the third element in `nodes`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` increments the value of `c1` by the value of `coef1[j]`. Initially, `c1` is defined as `coef1[j+1] + coef1[j+1]`. After executing the code, `c1` becomes `coef1[j+1] + coef1[j+1] + coef1[j]`. The values of `c0` and `j` remain unchanged.
