Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks, ensuring that no stick is used in more than one polygon.
2. The provided solution uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each stick length and then calculates how many complete polygons can be made by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3. However, this approach does not correctly handle the constraint that no stick should be reused across different polygons.
3. The function `func_1` currently returns the sum of the integer division of the frequencies by 3, which does not account for the fact that once a polygon is formed, the corresponding sticks should not be counted again.
4. To correctly solve the problem, we need to keep track of the sticks used in each polygon and ensure that they are not reused. The current implementation does not do this.

However, upon closer inspection, the function `func_1` actually does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated. The function simply divides the frequency of each stick length by 3, which is not equivalent to forming polygons with those sticks. The function does not consider the actual formation of polygons or the constraint that no stick should be reused.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated because it does not ensure that sticks are not reused across different polygons.

Final: **False**
