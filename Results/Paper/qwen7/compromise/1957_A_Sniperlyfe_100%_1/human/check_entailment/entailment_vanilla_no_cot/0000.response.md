Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the number of regular polygons that can be formed by checking how many sets of three equal sides can be made from the sticks. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of forming multiple polygons with different numbers of sides (e.g., triangles and quadrilaterals).

To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the minimum number of sides required for each type of polygon and ensure that the sticks can form at least one complete polygon before moving on to the next larger polygon. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Dictionary to store frequency of each stick length
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    
    # List to store the count of possible polygons
    polygons = [0] * 101  # Maximum possible side length is 100
    
    # Fill the polygons array
    for length in freq:
        while freq[length] >= 3:
            polygons[3] += 1
            freq[length] -= 3
        while freq[length] >= 4:
            polygons[4] += 1
            freq[length] -= 4
        while freq[length] >= 5:
            polygons[5] += 1
            freq[length] -= 5
        # Continue for higher polygons if needed, but up to the maximum side length of 100
    
    # The result is the maximum number of polygons that can be formed
    print(max(polygons))
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly counts the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by considering the constraints of forming at least one complete polygon at a time.
