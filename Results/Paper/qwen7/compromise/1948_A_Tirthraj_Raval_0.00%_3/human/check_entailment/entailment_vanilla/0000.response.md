Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Checking for Special Characters:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters in a string where each special character must be different from exactly one of its neighbors.
   - If `n` is even, it proceeds to construct a string with `n` special characters.

3. **Constructing the String:**
   - The program constructs a pattern using 'A' and 'B'.
   - It alternates between 'A' and 'B' to ensure that each character is special. Specifically, it uses the pattern "ABABAB..." to achieve this.
   - The length of the pattern constructed is `n // 2 * 2`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

4. **Printing the Result:**
   - If a suitable string can be constructed (i.e., `n` is even), it prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string.
   - If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

#### Test Case 1: \( n = 6 \)
- The program will check if 6 is odd (it's not).
- It will construct the string "ABABAB" and print "YES ABABAB".

#### Test Case 2: \( n = 1 \)
- The program will check if 1 is odd (it is).
- It will print "NO".

#### Test Case 3: \( n = 2 \)
- The program will check if 2 is odd (it's not).
- It will construct the string "AB" and print "YES AB".

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the problem description accurately. It checks for the parity of `n` and constructs the appropriate string when possible.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
