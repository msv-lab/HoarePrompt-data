Output State: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `i` is 0, `pattern` contains 'A', 'B', 'AB', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'AB', 'B'.

Explanation: The loop runs `n // 2` times. Given the output state after 3 iterations, we can deduce that `n` must be 6 (since the loop runs 3 times). Therefore, the loop will run exactly 3 more times, appending 'A', 'B', 'AB', and 'B' to the `pattern` list. After all iterations, `i` will be 0 (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, reaching 5 before the loop ends, but the condition checks `range(n // 2)` which is 3 for `n=6`). The `pattern` list will contain 'A', 'B', 'AB', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'AB', 'B'.
