Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `n` is an input integer, and `pattern` remains unchanged**.

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `t` and `pattern` remain unchanged, and `n` is now set to the integer value of the user's input.
