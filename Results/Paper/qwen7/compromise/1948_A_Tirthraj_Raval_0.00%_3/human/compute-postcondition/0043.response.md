Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `n` is an integer, and `pattern` remains unchanged. After executing `n = int(input())`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `t` and `pattern` remain unchanged, and `n` is now an integer based on the user's input.
