Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1. This means `t` is a positive integer that has been decremented from some initial value. The variable `n` is an integer that will be assigned a value through user input, but this value does not affect the `print` statement. The `pattern` is mentioned but its value is not relevant to the `print` statement. The `print('YES')` statement simply outputs the string 'YES', regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `pattern`.
