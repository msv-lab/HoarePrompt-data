Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `pattern` remains unchanged.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, or `pattern`.

Output: **NO**
