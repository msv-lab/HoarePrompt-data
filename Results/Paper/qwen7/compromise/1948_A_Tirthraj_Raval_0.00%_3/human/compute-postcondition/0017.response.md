Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `pattern` is a list containing one more element than before with the last two elements being 'A' and 'B', `i` is `i_current + 1`, the new element appended to `pattern` is 'B'**.

Explanation: The code appends `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]` to the `pattern` list. Given that `i` is `i_current + 1`, `i % 2` will evaluate to either 0 or 1 depending on whether `i_current + 1` is even or odd. The expression `i % 2 ^ 1` will then evaluate to 1 or 0 respectively (since `^ 1` flips the bit). Thus, `'AB'[1]` or `'B'` is appended to `pattern`. The other variables remain unchanged.
