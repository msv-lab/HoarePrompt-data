Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `pattern` remains unchanged.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `pattern` are not relevant to this particular print statement.

Output: **YES**
