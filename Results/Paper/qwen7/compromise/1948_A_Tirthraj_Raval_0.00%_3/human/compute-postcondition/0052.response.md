Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `i` is 2, `pattern` contains 'A'**

Explanation: The code appends either 'A' or 'B' to the list `pattern` based on the value of `i % 2`. Since `i` is initially 3, `i % 2` equals 1, so 'B' would be appended if `i` was even, but since `i` is odd, 'A' is appended instead. After appending 'A', `i` is decremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is only referenced and not modified in the given code snippet.
