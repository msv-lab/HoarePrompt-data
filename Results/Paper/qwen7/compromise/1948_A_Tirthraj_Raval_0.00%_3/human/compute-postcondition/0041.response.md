Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `pattern` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - For each iteration, if `n` is odd, `t` is decremented by 1 and `n` remains unchanged.
   - If `n` is at least 6, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is set to 6, `i` is equal to 3, and `pattern` is a list containing 6 elements where every even index element is 'A' and every odd index element is 'B'.

3. **Determine the New States:**
   - Since the loop is running for `t` iterations, at the start of the next iteration, `t` will be decremented by 1.
   - We need to check the condition for `n`:
     - If `n` is odd, `t` is decremented by 1 and `n` remains unchanged.
     - If `n` is at least 6, `t` is decremented by 1, `n` is set to 6, `i` is equal to 3, and `pattern` is a list containing 6 elements where every even index element is 'A' and every odd index element is 'B'.

Given that the loop is about to execute one more time, let's consider the possible scenarios:

- If `n` is odd, `t` will be decremented by 1 and `n` will remain unchanged.
- If `n` is at least 6, `t` will be decremented by 1, `n` will be set to 6, `i` will be 3, and `pattern` will be a list containing 6 elements where every even index element is 'A' and every odd index element is 'B'.

Since we don't know the exact value of `n`, we need to consider both cases. However, the most general and safe assumption is to consider the decrement of `t` and the potential change in `n`.

Therefore, the new states at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` is decremented by 1 (since it is always decremented).
- `n` could either remain unchanged or be set to 6.
- `i` will be 3 if `n` is at least 6.
- `pattern` will be a list containing 6 elements where every even index element is 'A' and every odd index element is 'B' if `n` is at least 6.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `n` must be an integer that could either remain unchanged or be set to 6, `i` is 3 if `n` is at least 6, and `pattern` is a list containing 6 elements where every even index element is 'A' and every odd index element is 'B'.**
