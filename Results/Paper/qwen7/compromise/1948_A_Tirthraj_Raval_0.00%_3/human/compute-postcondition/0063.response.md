Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, but these integers are not directly passed to the function. Instead, the function is expected to handle these integers internally based on the given constraints and return a result accordingly.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value are not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the internal operations.
