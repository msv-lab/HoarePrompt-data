Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1. This means `t` was initialized as some positive integer and then decremented by 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `pattern` is an empty list (though this variable is not part of the loop head).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n // 2` is greater than 0. This means `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - Since the loop depends on `n`, `n` must be at least 2.
   - The loop starts with `i` being 0, so `i` should be set to 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to the previous value of `t` minus 1, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
