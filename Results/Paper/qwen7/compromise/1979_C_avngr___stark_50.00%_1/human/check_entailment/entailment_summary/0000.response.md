Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The provided program attempts to solve this by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then distributing the coins accordingly.

2. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`), which is effectively the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers since they are all integers.
   - It then calculates the distribution of coins `c` by dividing the LCM by each multiplier.
   - The program uses a helper function `func_1` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c`. However, the GCD is not necessary for solving the problem correctly.
   - After normalizing the distribution using the GCD, it checks if the sum of the normalized distribution is less than or equal to the LCM divided by the GCD. If so, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists. Otherwise, it prints the normalized distribution.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The approach of using the LCM to distribute coins ensures that the total bet is minimized while still being less than the potential winnings for any outcome.
   - The normalization step using the GCD ensures that the distribution is in the smallest integer form, but it is not strictly necessary for correctness.
   - The logic to check if the sum of the distribution is less than or equal to the LCM divided by the GCD is correct, ensuring the condition is met.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
