You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

- Program:
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = 1
    for i in range(n):
        m = m * k[i]
    c = []
    for i in range(n):
        c.append(int(m / k[i]))
    hcf = func_1(c)
    for i in range(n):
        c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf)
    if sum(c) >= m / hcf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            print(c[i], end=' ')
        print('')

def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
    return hcf



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of numbers and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the elements in the list. Given a list of positive integers, the function calculates and returns their greatest common divisor.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Calculating the Product of Multipliers:**
   - The program calculates the product `m` of all multipliers.
   - This is done using the line `m = m * k[i]`, which iterates through all multipliers and multiplies them together.

3. **Calculating Individual Bets:**
   - The program then calculates individual bets `c[i]` for each outcome using the formula `c[i] = int(m / k[i])`.
   - This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is `sum(c)`.

4. **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
   - The program calls a function `func_1` to find the GCD of the calculated bets `c`.
   - This function correctly uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to compute the GCD.

5. **Adjusting Bets to Ensure Feasibility:**
   - The program divides each bet `c[i]` by the GCD found in the previous step.
   - This step ensures that the bets are simplified to their smallest form while maintaining the ratio.

6. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the adjusted bets is less than the product `m` divided by the GCD.
   - If the sum is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`, it prints `-1` indicating no feasible solution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the adjusted bets.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Mathematical Feasibility:**
   - The logic of calculating bets and checking feasibility is mathematically sound.
   - The use of GCD simplifies the bets to their smallest form, ensuring the sum of bets is minimized.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the sum of bets is not less than the required value by printing `-1`.

3. **Functionality:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the GCD of a list of numbers.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program outputs the bets in the required format, either `-1` or the sequence of bets.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine and print the bets in a way that ensures coming out ahead in the event of any winning outcome, as per the problem statement.
