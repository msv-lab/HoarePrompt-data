Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with an argument `c`, which is a list of integers derived from the multipliers but not defined in the main logic. This should be replaced with `k` since `k` contains the multipliers directly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of HCF**: The function `func_1` calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the list `c`. However, the logic to ensure the distribution of coins meets the requirement is flawed. Specifically, the check `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` is incorrect because it doesn't ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any outcome.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Distribution**: The logic to distribute the coins needs to ensure that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the reward for each outcome. The current approach does not correctly handle this condition.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the product of all multipliers
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product *= k[i]
    
    # Distribute the coins such that the sum of bets is strictly less than the reward for each outcome
    c = [product // k[i] for i in range(n)]
    
    # Ensure the sum of bets is strictly less than the reward for each outcome
    if sum(c) >= min(k):
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            print(c[i], end=' ')
        print('')
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the minimum reward for any outcome, thus meeting the problem requirements.
