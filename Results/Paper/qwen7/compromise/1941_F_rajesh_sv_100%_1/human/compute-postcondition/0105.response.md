Postcondition: **`ans` holds the smallest value it has been updated to throughout the process, which is determined by the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f) at each step. All other variables (`l`, `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `left`, `right`, `f`, and `D`) remain in their final states from the loop.**
