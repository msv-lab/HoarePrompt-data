Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, `h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, and `l` must be less than `h`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `D[mid] + f` to `mid_sum` and `D[mid + 1] + f` to `mid_next_sum`. The values of `mid`, `h`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state because the code does not modify these variables. Therefore, `mid` is still `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, `h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`, and `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, with the condition that `l` must be less than `h`.
