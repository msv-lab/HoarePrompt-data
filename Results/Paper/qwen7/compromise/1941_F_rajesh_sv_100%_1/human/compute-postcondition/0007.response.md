Output State: `testcases` must be greater than 3.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `testcases` must have a value greater than 3. This is because the loop runs `testcases` times, and if it has run 3 times, `testcases` must have been at least 3 initially and has not been modified within the loop to reduce its value. Therefore, for the loop to have completed all its iterations, `testcases` must be greater than 3.
