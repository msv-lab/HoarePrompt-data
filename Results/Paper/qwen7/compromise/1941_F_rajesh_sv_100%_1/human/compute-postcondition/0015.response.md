Output State: **`max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is the current value of `diff`, `index` is None, `i` is 2, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `diff` to `next_max_diff`. Since the initial value of `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` now holds the value of `diff`. The other variables remain unchanged.
