Output State: **`max_diff` is `diff`, `next_max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `index` is 7, `i` is 7**.

The code `index = i` assigns the value of `i`, which is 7, to the variable `index`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `max_diff` remains `diff`, `next_max_diff` remains the maximum difference found so far, and `i` remains 7.
