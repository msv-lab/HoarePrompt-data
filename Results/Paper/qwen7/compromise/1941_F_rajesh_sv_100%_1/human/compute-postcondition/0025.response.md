Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is `diff`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 5, `diff` is A[5] - A[4]**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `diff` to `next_max_diff`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `diff` is defined as `A[5] - A[4]`, `next_max_diff` now holds this value. The other variables (`max_diff`, `index`, `i`, and `diff`) retain their previous states.
