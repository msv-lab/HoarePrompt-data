The loop condition is `l < h`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `l < h` must remain true. Given that `l` remains unchanged and `h` remains unchanged, the only way to ensure the loop continues is to ensure that `l < h` still holds true.

Since no other variables in the loop head are adjustable, and `l` and `h` are the only variables that affect the loop condition, we need to ensure that `l < h`.

Therefore, the state at the end of the previous iteration should be adjusted to reflect that `l < h` must still hold true.

State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f); `l` remains unchanged; `h` remains unchanged; `mid` remains unchanged; `mid_sum` remains unchanged; `mid_next_sum` remains unchanged; `left` remains unchanged; `right` remains unchanged; `f` remains unchanged; `D` remains unchanged; `l < h` must still hold true**
