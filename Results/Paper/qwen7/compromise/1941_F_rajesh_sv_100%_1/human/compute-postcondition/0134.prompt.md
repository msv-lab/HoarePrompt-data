Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is updated to the position where `D[l]` is the smallest value greater than `left - f`, `ans` holds the smallest value it has been updated to throughout the process, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `h` is one less than the index where `D` is the smallest value greater than `right - f`, `D`, `f`, `left`, `right`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `h`, `left`, `right`, `D`, `f`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, `ans`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `left`, `right`, `D`, `f` remain in their final states from the loop.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`, `h` is either greater than `l` or equal to `mid`, and depending on the condition, either `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` holds true, leading to `l` being updated to `mid + 1`, or the condition `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum` holds true, leading to `h` being updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`, `h` is strictly greater than `l`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `h` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`, `h` is either strictly greater than `l` or equal to `mid`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2` and `l` is set to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2` and `h` is set to `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
