Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far; `next_max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable); `i` is 7; `diff` is A[6] - A[5]**.

Explanation: The line `next_max_diff = max_diff` assigns the current value of `max_diff` to `next_max_diff`. This means that `next_max_diff` now holds the same value as `max_diff`. The other variables (`index`, `i`, and `diff`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
