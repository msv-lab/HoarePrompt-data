Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 5, `diff` is A[5] - A[4]**.

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `max_diff` to `next_max_diff`. This means that `next_max_diff` now holds the same value as `max_diff`. The other variables (`index`, `i`, and `diff`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
