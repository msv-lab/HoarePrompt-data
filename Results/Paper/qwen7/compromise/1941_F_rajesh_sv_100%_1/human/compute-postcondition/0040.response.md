Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found across all pairs of adjacent elements in the list `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found (or -inf if no such difference exists), `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is `n`, and `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]` if `max_diff` was updated during the last iteration or does not exist otherwise.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `max_diff` will hold the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in the list `A`, `next_max_diff` will hold the second largest difference (if it exists), `index` will indicate the index where `max_diff` occurred (or will be `None` if `max_diff` is `-inf`), and `i` will be equal to `n` (the total number of elements in `A`). The variable `diff` will reflect the difference that caused the update of `max_diff` in the last iteration, or it will be irrelevant if `max_diff` did not change in the last iteration.
