Output State: **`l` is equal to `mid + 1`; `h` remains unchanged; `mid` remains unchanged; `mid_sum` remains unchanged; `mid_next_sum` remains unchanged; `ans` remains unchanged; `left` remains unchanged; `right` remains unchanged; `f` remains unchanged; `D` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. All other variables (`h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `ans`, `left`, `right`, `f`, and `D`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
