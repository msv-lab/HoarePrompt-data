Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < h`.
2. **Identify the loop head variables**: The relevant variables in the loop head are `l`, `h`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, and `mid_next_sum`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`
   - `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`
   - `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`
   - `h` is strictly greater than `l`
   - `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`
   - If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `h` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.

4. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `l < h`.
   - Since `h` is strictly greater than `l` at the start of the loop, and `h` can only change if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, the only variable that can change is `h`.
   - If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum` is true, `h` remains unchanged. If false, `h` is updated to `mid`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `h` must remain such that `l < h` still holds true.
   - Therefore, `h` should not be updated to a value that would make `l >= h`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `h` to ensure it remains strictly greater than `l`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`, `h` must be strictly greater than `l`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `h` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.**
