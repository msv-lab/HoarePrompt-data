Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < h`.
2. **Current states before the loop**:
   - `l` is updated to the position where `D[l]` is the smallest value greater than `left - f`.
   - `ans` holds the smallest value it has been updated to throughout the process.
   - `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, meaning `h` is one less than the index where `D` is the smallest value greater than `right - f`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop `while l < h` to execute at least once, the condition `l < h` must be true.
   - Given that `l` is the position where `D[l]` is the smallest value greater than `left - f`, and `h` is one less than the index where `D` is the smallest value greater than `right - f`, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h`.

4. **Analyze the current values**:
   - Since `h` is defined as `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, it means `h` is the largest index such that `D[h] <= right - f`.
   - `l` is the position where `D[l]` is the smallest value greater than `left - f`.

5. **Ensure the loop executes**:
   - For `l < h` to be true, `l` must be less than `h`.
   - If `l` is already less than `h`, no adjustment is needed.
   - If `l` is not less than `h`, then `l` must be adjusted to be less than `h`.

Since the problem does not provide specific values for `l` and `h`, we assume the worst-case scenario where `l` might be equal to or greater than `h`. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust `l` to be strictly less than `h`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `l` must be less than `h`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`l` must be less than `h`**
