Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `while l < h`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `l` is less than `h`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`.
   - `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`.
   - `l` must be less than `h`.
   - `mid` is recalculated based on the condition `(mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum)`.
     - If the condition is true, `mid` becomes `mid + 1`, and `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated accordingly.
     - Otherwise, `h` remains `mid`, and `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, with `mid` recalculated as usual.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `h`.
   - Since the loop condition is `l < h`, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h` for the next iteration.
   - The values of `h` and `l` are critical for this condition to hold true.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `l` is less than `h` for the next iteration.
   - If `l` is not less than `h` at the end of the current iteration, we need to adjust the state such that `l` is less than `h`.

Given the conditions and the loop head, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h` for the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `l` is less than `h`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, and `l` must be less than `h`**.
