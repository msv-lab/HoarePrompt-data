Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each character in the string `password`. Therefore, the objects involved in the loop head are `char`, `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
   - `char` will take on the value of each character in `password` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in `password` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: For the loop to execute, `password` must contain at least one character. If `password` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `password` to ensure it contains at least one character.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit**.
