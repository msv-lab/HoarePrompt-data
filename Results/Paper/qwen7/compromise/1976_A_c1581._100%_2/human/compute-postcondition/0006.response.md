The code `letters.sort()` sorts the list `letters` in ascending order. Since the initial state of `letters` contains all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string, sorting this list will arrange these letters in alphabetical order. The other variables (`password`, `digits`, and the unsorted state of `letters`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string sorted in ascending order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string sorted in alphabetical order.**
