Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly separates digits and letters from the password.
2. It sorts the digits and letters separately.
3. It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
4. It ensures that all digits come before any letters.
5. It verifies that the concatenated sorted digits and letters match the original password structure.
6. The main program loop correctly processes each test case and prints "YES" or "NO" based on the result from `func_1`.

Given the execution summary and the provided reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if a password is strong according to the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
