### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the string `a` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - It initializes an array `count` of size 7 to zero, which will store the count of each difficulty level.
   - **Count Calculation**:
     - It iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `count` for each character.
   - **Needed Problems Calculation**:
     - It then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level by checking if the count of any difficulty level is less than `m`. If it is, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.
   - **Return Statement**:
     - Finally, it returns `needed_problems`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic implemented in the code is correct. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `a` and calculates the number of additional problems needed to meet the requirement of having at least one problem of each difficulty level for `m` rounds.
   - The loop iterates over all seven difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') and ensures that for each difficulty level, the number of additional problems needed is calculated correctly.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example provided:
     - Test Case 1: `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
       - Count: `[1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`
       - Needed Problems: `2` (one 'A' and one 'F')
     - Test Case 2: `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
       - Count: `[1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`
       - Needed Problems: `5` (one 'A', one 'F', and three 'G')
     - Test Case 3: `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BBCDEFFGG'`
       - Count: `[1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 3, 2]`
       - Needed Problems: `1` (one 'C')

The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all given examples accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given examples.
