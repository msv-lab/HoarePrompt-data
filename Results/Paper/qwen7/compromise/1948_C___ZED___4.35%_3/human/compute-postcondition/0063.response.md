Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string from the user, `b` is the input string from the user, and the second last character of `b` is not '>', `b` is updated to the new input string.**

The code `b = input()` takes a new input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
