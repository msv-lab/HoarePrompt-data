Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the new input string from the user, `b` is the input string from the user, and the second last character of `b` is not '>'. `b` is updated to the new input string. If `n` equals 1, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `k` will be equal to `n-2`, `no_path` will be `True` if any `a[k]` (where `k` is odd and less than `n`) is not equal to '>', otherwise `no_path` remains `True` if it was not set to `False` during the loop.**
