Output State: **`k` is 1, `n` retains its original value, and `no_path` is False, and `a[k]` is not equal to '>'**

Explanation: The variable `no_path` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `k`, `n`, or `a[k]`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
