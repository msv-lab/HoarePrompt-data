Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the input string from the user, and the second last character of `b` is not '>', and if `n` equals 1, then `b` remains a string. If `n` is at least 2, then `b` is a list where every even-indexed element up to `n-2` is not equal to '>', and `no_path` remains unchanged based on its initial value.
