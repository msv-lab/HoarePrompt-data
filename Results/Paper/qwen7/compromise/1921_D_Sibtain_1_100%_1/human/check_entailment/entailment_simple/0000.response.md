Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the edge case where both arrays `a` and `b` contain identical elements. In such a scenario, the total difference `D` would be zero, and the program correctly prints `0`.

3. **Sorting Arrays**: The program sorts array `a` in ascending order and array `c` (renamed as `b` in the code) in descending order. This step is crucial because it allows the algorithm to maximize the differences by pairing the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `b` and vice versa.

4. **Main Loop Logic**: The main loop iterates through the elements of `a` while maintaining pointers `i` and `j` to traverse `a` and `b` respectively. The logic inside the loop ensures that the maximum possible difference is calculated by always taking the larger of the two differences at each step. This approach ensures that the total difference `D` is maximized.

5. **Final Output**: After the loop completes, the program prints the accumulated value of `ans`, which represents the maximum possible total difference `D`.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference `D` as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
