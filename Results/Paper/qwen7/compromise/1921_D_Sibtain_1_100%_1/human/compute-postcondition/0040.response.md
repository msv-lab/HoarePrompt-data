Output State: **`k` is 2, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `i` and `j` are incremented based on the condition. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1, and `t2` remains as the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`.**

Explanation: The code adds the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to `ans`. The values of `k`, `i`, `j`, `t1`, `t2`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial conditions except that `ans` is updated to include the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. The conditions for incrementing `i` and `j` based on the comparison of `t1` and `t2` are preserved.
