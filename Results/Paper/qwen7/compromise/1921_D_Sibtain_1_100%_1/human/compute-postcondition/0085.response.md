Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is set to `0`.
- `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from `k = len(a) - 1` down to `k = 0`.
- `i` and `j` are the final values determined by the loop's conditions.
- `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])` with `i` being the last updated index.
- `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - k] - c[len(c) - k])`.

Since `k` starts at `len(a) - 1` and decrements to `0`, the loop will run once (because `k` is already `0` at the start). In this single iteration:

- `t2` will be `abs(a[len(a) - 0] - c[len(c) - 0])`, which simplifies to `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`.
- `t1` will be `abs(a[i] - c[i])` with `i` being the last updated index, but since no updates are mentioned and `i` is not explicitly initialized, we assume `i` is also `len(a) - 1` at the end of the loop.
- Therefore, `t1` will be `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`.

Since both `t1` and `t2` are the same in this single iteration, `max(t1, t2)` will simply be `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`.

Thus, `ans` will be this value.

Output: **abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])**
