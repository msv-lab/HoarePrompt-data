Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from `k=len(a)-1` down to `k=1`, `i` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `j` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])` with `i` being the last updated index, `t2` is `abs(a[n - m] - c[m - 1])`, `a` is sorted, and `n`, `m`, `c` are as initially defined.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `k`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, `m`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
