Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `t1` to be the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`.
- The values of `k`, `ans`, `j`, and the conditions for `i` remain unchanged.
- The value of `t1` is now `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, where `i` is either 1 or 2.
