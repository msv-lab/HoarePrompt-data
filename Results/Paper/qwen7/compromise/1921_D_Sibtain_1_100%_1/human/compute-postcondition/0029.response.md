Output State: **`k` is 1, `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 100\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order (before the code) and then sorted in non-increasing order, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 2 or 1, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[-1]` and `c[-1]`, `t2` is calculated as the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`.**

Explanation: The variable `j` was initially either 1 or 2, and after executing `j += 1`, `j` is now incremented by 1. Therefore, if `j` was initially 1, it is now 2, and if `j` was initially 2, it remains 2. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
