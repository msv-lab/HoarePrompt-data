Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from `k=len(a)-1` down to `k=1`, `i` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `j` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])` with `i` being the last updated index, `t2` is `abs(a[n - m] - c[m - 1])`, `a` is a list of integers inputted by the user, `n` and `m` are integers inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads a list of integers from the user input and assigns it to the variable `a`. This changes the value of `a` to a list of integers, but does not affect the values of `k`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, `t1`, `t2`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables except for `a`, which now holds the list of integers inputted by the user.
