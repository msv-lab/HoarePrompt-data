The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since the context of the loop is not provided, we assume that the loop has already completed all its iterations before the `continue` statement is encountered. Therefore, the `continue` statement does not affect the values of the variables outside the loop.

The output state remains the same as the initial state because the `continue` statement does not modify any variables or change the conditions outside the loop.

Output State: **`k` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` and `j` have been appropriately incremented, and the loop has completed all iterations, `c` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**
