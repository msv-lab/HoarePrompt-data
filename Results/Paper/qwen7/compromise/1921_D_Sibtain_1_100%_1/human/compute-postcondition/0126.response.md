Output State: **k is len(a), ans is the sum of max(t1, t2) for each iteration, t1 is the absolute difference between a[i] and c[i], t2 is the absolute difference between a[len(a) - j] and c[len(c) - j].**

In this final state, `k` will be equal to the length of list `a` because the loop runs for each index in `a`. The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop. The values of `t1` and `t2` will be recalculated for each iteration based on the current values of `i` and `j`, but their specific values will depend on the elements of lists `a` and `c` and the current indices `i` and `j` at each step.
