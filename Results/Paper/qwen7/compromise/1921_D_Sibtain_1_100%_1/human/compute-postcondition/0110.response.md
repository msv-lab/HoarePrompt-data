Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for k in range(len(a))`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The only variable directly involved in the loop head is `k`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `k < len(a)`.

4. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is 0
   - `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`
   - `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`
   - `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is based on `k`, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `k` will become 1.
   - The values of `t1` and `t2` remain unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - The value of `ans` will be updated based on the new values of `t1` and `t2` during the next iteration, but we don't know the exact values yet.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `k` will be 1.
   - `t1` and `t2` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new values of `t1` and `t2` during the next iteration, but we don't know the exact value yet.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`**
