Output State: **`k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`**.

Explanation: The line `ans += max(t1, t2)` adds the maximum value between `t1` and `t2` to `ans`. The values of `k`, `t1`, `t2`, `a[i]`, `c[i]`, `a[len(a) - j]`, and `c[len(c) - j]` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that `ans` now holds its original value plus the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.
