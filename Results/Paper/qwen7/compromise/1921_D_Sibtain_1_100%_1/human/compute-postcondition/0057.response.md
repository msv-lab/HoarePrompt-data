Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for k in range(len(a)):`. The variables involved here are `k` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `k` is initially set to the length of the sorted list `a`.
   - `len(a)` is a function call that returns the length of the list `a`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than the length of `a`. Initially, `k` is equal to the length of `a`, so the loop will not execute because `k` is not less than `len(a)`.

4. **Adjust the state to allow the loop to execute**: To make the loop execute, `k` must be less than `len(a)`. Therefore, we need to decrement `k` by 1 so that the loop condition `k < len(a)` becomes true.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`ans`, `i`, `j`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. They remain as given in the initial state.

Based on the above reasoning, we need to adjust `k` to be one less than the length of `a` to ensure the loop executes.

**Final State**:
State: **`k` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
