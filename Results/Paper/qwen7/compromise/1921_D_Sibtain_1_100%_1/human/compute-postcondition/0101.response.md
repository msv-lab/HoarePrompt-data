Output State: **`k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])` calculates the absolute difference between the elements `a[i]` and `c[i]` and assigns it to the variable `t1`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0 and no operation altered its value. The length of `a` being greater than 0 is also still a valid precondition but since no code directly impacted it, it's not included in the updated variables.
