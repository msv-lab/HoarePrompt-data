Postcondition: `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 100\); `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()); `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()); if the set of `a` contains only one unique element, the set of `c` contains only one unique element, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, then the condition is met. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to the variables.
