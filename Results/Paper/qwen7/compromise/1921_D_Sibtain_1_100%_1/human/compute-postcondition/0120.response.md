Output State: **`k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t2` to be the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. The other variables (`k`, `ans`, `t1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
