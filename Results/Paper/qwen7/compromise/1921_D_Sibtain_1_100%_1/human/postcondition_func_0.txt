The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers n and m, followed by lists a and c. If a and c are uniform and match, it prints 0. Otherwise, it sorts a in ascending order and c in descending order. Then, it calculates the total sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of a and c, considering specific conditions for indices i and j. Finally, it prints the total sum.
