Reasoning:

The provided code aims to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Coordinate Collection**: For each test case, it collects four coordinates and stores them in the `coord` list.
3. **Sorting Coordinates**: The coordinates are sorted based on their first element (x-coordinate).
4. **Calculating Distances**: It calculates the squared Euclidean distances between two pairs of points:
   - `p1` is the distance between the first and second points.
   - `p2` is the distance between the third and fourth points.
5. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is calculated as the product of the square roots of these distances, assuming the square's side length is the same for both pairs of points.
6. **Output**: The area is rounded and printed.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the logic appears to be correct. However, there are a few potential issues to consider:

- **Sorting Logic**: Sorting the coordinates based on the first element assumes that the square's sides are aligned with the coordinate axes. This assumption holds true for the given problem statement but might not be explicitly clear in the code.
- **Distance Calculation**: The distances `p1` and `p2` should represent the side lengths of the square. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distances between corresponding points should indeed be equal.

Given the provided explanation and the logic, the code seems to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the provided code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
