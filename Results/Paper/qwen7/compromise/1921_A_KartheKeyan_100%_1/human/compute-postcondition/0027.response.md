Output State: **`total` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is [(x, y)], `i` must be 0, 1, or 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`, `p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` is an empty list. After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` becomes `[(x, y)]`. The values of `total`, `n`, `i`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
