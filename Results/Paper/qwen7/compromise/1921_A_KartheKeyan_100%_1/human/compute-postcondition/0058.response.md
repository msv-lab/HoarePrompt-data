Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is 3, `coord` is [(`x`, `y`), (input integer, input integer), (`x`, `y`), (input integer, input integer)], `p1` is (input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)², `res` is 0, `x` is the last input integer, `y` is the last input integer, `p2` is ((input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)²)**

Explanation: The code calculates `p2` as the squared distance between the points `(coord[3][0], coord[3][1])` and `(coord[2][0], coord[2][1])`. Given that `coord[3]` is (`x`, `y`) and `coord[2]` is (input integer, input integer), `p2` is calculated as ((input integer - `x`)² + (input integer - `y`)²). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
