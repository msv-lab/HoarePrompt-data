Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is 3, `coord` is an empty list, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `p1` is 0, `res` is 0, `x` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `y` is assigned the value of the second integer input.**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
