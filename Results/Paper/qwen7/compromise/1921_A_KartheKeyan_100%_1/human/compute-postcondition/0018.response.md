Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` contains four tuples of coordinates sorted by the first element, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`, `p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `p2` as the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`. Since `coord` contains four tuples of coordinates sorted by the first element, `p2` is computed using the fourth and third tuples in `coord`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
