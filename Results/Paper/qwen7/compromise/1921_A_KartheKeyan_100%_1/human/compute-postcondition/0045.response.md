Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(4)`. This means the loop variable `i` will take values from 0 to 3.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as 3. However, for the loop to start executing, `i` should be within the range specified by `range(4)`, which includes values from 0 to 3 inclusive.

3. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 3, and the loop will iterate until `i` becomes 4 (which is out of the range), the loop will not execute at all because the condition `i < 4` is not met initially.

4. **Other variables in the loop head**: The other variables (`n`, `coord`, `x`, `y`, `p1`, `res`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is the initial value of `i` to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `i` should be set to 0 or any value within the range of `range(4)` to allow the loop to start.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total` is 0, `i` must be 0, `n` is 3, `coord` is an empty list, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input, `p1` is 0, `res` is 0**
