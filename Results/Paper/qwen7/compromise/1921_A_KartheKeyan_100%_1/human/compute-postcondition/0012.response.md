Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning them to `x` and `y`. The initial values of `res`, `n`, `coord`, and `i` remain unchanged. The input values for `x` and `y` are not specified, so they are referred to as "an input integer" each.
