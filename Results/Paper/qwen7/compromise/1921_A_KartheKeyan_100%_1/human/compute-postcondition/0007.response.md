Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `i` is 0**

The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` is an empty list. After executing the line `coord.append((x, y))`, `coord` contains one tuple `(x, y)`. The other variables (`res`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.
