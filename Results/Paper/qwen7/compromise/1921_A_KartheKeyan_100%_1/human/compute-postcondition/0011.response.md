Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(4):` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `res` is 0
   - `n` must be non-zero
   - `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[(x, y), (x, y)]`
   - `i` is 1

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 4. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, it will execute 4 times in total (from 0 to 3).

4. **Calculate the New Value of `i`**: Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, after the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.

5. **Check if the Loop Should Continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than 4. Since `i` is now 2, the loop will continue.

6. **Adjust the States**: The only variable that changes within the loop head is `i`. Therefore, we need to update `i` to 2. The other variables (`res`, `n`, and `coord`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

**Final State**:
State: **`res` is 0, `n` must be non-zero, `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[(x, y), (x, y)]`, `i` is 2**
