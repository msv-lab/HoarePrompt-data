Output State: **`res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `n` is 2, `coord` contains four tuples of coordinates sorted by the first element, `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `p1` is the squared Euclidean distance between the second and first points in `coord`, `p2` is the sum of the squares of the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the fourth and third points in `coord`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decremented by 1, changing its value from the initial non-zero value (which was at least 1) to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
