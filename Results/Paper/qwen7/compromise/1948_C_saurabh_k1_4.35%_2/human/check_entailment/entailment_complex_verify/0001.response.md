### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in the given program. The program only checks if the second-to-last character in the second row is `>` and prints 'Yes' if it is, and 'No' otherwise. This logic is insufficient because it does not validate the entire path the robot must take to reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

To properly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the movement of the robot through the grid, ensuring that it follows the arrows correctly from the starting cell `(1, 1)` to the target cell `(2, n)`. The given program fails to do this, as it does not account for the sequence of movements required to reach the target.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not validate the entire path the robot must take to reach the target cell `(2, n)`. It only checks one specific condition, which is not enough to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.
