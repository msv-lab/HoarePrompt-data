Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It then reads two strings representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid.

2. **Checking the Condition:**
   - The program checks if the second-to-last character in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) is `<`.
     - If it is `<`, the program prints 'No'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

3. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and needs to reach `(2, n)`.
   - The robot can only move according to the direction of the arrows in the cells.
   - The key observation here is that if the robot reaches the second-to-last column in the second row (`(2, n-1)`), it must move down to `(2, n)` if the arrow in that cell is `>`.

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The program only checks the second-to-last column in the second row (`(2, n-1)`) and assumes that if the arrow is `>`, the robot can reach `(2, n)`. However, this is not sufficient.
   - The robot must follow the sequence of arrows correctly from `(1, 1)` to `(2, n)`. Simply checking one cell is insufficient.

2. **Missing Path Validation:**
   - The program does not validate the entire path from `(1, 1)` to `(2, n)`.
   - It does not check if the robot can navigate through the grid correctly by following the arrows.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly validate the entire path from the starting cell to the target cell. It only checks one specific condition, which is not enough to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

### Correctness: **False**
