Output State: `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1, `x` is now 1, `max` is `-100000000 - t`, `min` is `100000000 + t`, `ans` is a list containing alternating values starting from `max` (`-100000000 - t`) and decreasing by 1 each time until `min` (`100000000 + t`), and `ans` has been reversed.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will hold the total number of steps taken to reduce `x` to 1. The variable `x` will be 1 as it has reached the base case of the loop. The variable `max` will be `-100000000 - t` because it decreases by 1 for each even division operation, and `min` will be `100000000 + t` because it increases by 1 for each decrement operation when `x` is odd. The list `ans` will contain the sequence of values from `max` to `min` in reverse order, representing the operations performed during each iteration of the loop.
