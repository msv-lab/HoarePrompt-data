Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [], `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations (`i + t`).**

Explanation: The variable `t` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The total number of iterations `t` is now `0`, and `i` is incremented by `t`, which means `i` is also `0` now.
