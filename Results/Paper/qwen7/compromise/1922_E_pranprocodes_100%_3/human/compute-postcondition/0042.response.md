Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `x` is now 1.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1. Since `x` is already 1, `t` must be 0.
   - `max` is 99999998.
   - `min` is -99999998.
   - `ans` is a list containing alternating values starting from `max` (99999998) and decreasing by 1 each time until `min` (-99999998), and then the list has been reversed.

2. **Constructing the `ans` List:**
   - The list starts with `max` (99999998) and alternates between even and odd numbers.
   - It continues this pattern until it reaches `min` (-99999998).
   - After reaching `min`, the list is reversed.

3. **Reversing the List:**
   - Reversing the list means that the sequence of numbers from `max` to `min` is now in reverse order, starting from `-99999998` and increasing back to `99999998`.

4. **Printing the List:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the above steps, let's construct the list `ans`:

- The list starts from `99999998` and goes down to `-99999998` in alternating order.
- When reversed, the list will start from `-99999998` and go up to `99999998` in alternating order.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of alternating positive and negative numbers starting from `-99999998` and ending at `99999998`.

Output: **-99999998 99999997 -99999996 99999995 ... 1 -2 3 -4 ... 99999997 99999998**
