Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1; `t` is an input integer increased by 2; If `x` is even, `ans` is a list containing the function `max` with `max` decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the function `min` with `min` increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` was initially an input integer increased by 1, after executing the code, `t` is now an input integer increased by 2. The values of `x` and `ans` remain unchanged according to the initial conditions.
