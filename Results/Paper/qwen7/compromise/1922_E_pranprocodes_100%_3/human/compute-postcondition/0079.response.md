Postcondition: `t` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an integer except 1, now either halved or equal to the original value minus 1, `max` is 99999997, `min` is either 0, -100000000, or 1, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, 99999998, or 99999999, `x` is halved if it is even, otherwise `min` is appended to the list `ans`.
