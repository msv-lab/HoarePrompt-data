Output State: **The value of `x` will eventually become 1, `t` will be equal to the total number of iterations, `ans` will be a list containing alternating values of `max` decremented and `min` incremented until `x` becomes 1, `max` will be equal to `-100000000 - t`, `min` will be equal to `100000000 + t`, and `ans` will be reversed.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.reverse()` reverses the list `ans`. This means that the order of elements in `ans` will be flipped. However, since the initial construction of `ans` involves alternating between decrementing `max` and incrementing `min` until `x` becomes 1, reversing `ans` will simply reverse this sequence.
- The values of `x`, `t`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged from their initial conditions because the code does not modify these variables. The only change is in the list `ans`, which is now reversed.
