Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list**.

The initial value of `t` was a positive integer between 1 and 1000, but now it is explicitly set to 0. The values of `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.
