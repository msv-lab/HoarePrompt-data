Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1 following the given rules, `max` is 100000000, `min` is 1, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting from `max` and reversed, `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations (`i + t`).**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `max` to 100000000. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `max` and the unchanged states of `x`, `t`, `min`, `ans`, and `i`.
