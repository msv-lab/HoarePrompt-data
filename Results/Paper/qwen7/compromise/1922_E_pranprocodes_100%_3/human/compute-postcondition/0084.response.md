Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is 1.
- `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1 following the given rules. Since `x` is already 1, no iterations are needed to reduce it to 1.
- `max` is 99999997.
- `min` is 1.
- `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting from `max` and reversed. Given `max` is 99999997 and `min` is 1, `ans` would be `[99999997, 1]`.
- `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations, but since `t` is 0 (no iterations needed), `i` remains unchanged.

The `print(t)` statement will print the value of `t`, which is the number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1. As `x` is already 1, `t` is 0.

Output: **0**
