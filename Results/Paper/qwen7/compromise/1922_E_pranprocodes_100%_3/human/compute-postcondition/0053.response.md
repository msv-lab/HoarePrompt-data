Output State: **`x` is now an integer which is half of its original value (still even), `t` is 0, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000, `i` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code divides `x` by 2 using integer division (`//`), which means `x` is now half of its original value. Since `x` was initially an even number, it remains even after being halved. All other variables (`t`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
