Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `x` now holds the integer value entered by the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
