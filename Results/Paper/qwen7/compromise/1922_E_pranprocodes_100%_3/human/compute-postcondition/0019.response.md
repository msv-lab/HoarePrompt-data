Output State: **`t` is 1, `x` is different from 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, since `x` is odd and the code appends `max` (which is 99999999) to the list `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged at 1, `x` remains different from 1, `max` and `min` remain their original values of 99999999 and -99999999 respectively. The list `ans` now contains the value -100000000 and 99999999, reflecting the condition that `x` is odd.
