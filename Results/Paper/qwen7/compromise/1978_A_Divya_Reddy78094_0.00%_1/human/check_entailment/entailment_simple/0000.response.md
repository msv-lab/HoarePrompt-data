Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles, with each pile containing at least one book. The solution should consider the two largest books in the sorted list, as placing these two books in different piles will maximize the sum of the largest books in each pile.
- The annotated program sorts the list of book pages in descending order and then prints the sum of the first two elements, which corresponds to the two largest books. This approach is correct because it ensures that the two largest books are placed in different piles, maximizing the total number of pages read.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through each test case, sorting the list of book pages, and printing the required sum for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
