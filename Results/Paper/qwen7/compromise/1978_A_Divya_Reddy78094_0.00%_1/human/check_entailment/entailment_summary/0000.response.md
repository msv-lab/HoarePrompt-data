Reasoning:
The provided program aims to solve the problem by sorting the list of book page counts in descending order and then summing the two largest numbers. This approach is correct because the goal is to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by selecting the two largest numbers from the sorted list. Sorting the list ensures that the two largest numbers are at the beginning of the list, and their sum gives the maximum possible total number of pages Alice can read from the two piles.

The program correctly handles multiple test cases as described in the execution summary. It processes each test case by reading the number of books `n`, the list of page counts `nums`, sorting this list in descending order, and then printing the sum of the first two elements (which are the two largest numbers).

Given the logic and the implementation, the program should work correctly for the given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
