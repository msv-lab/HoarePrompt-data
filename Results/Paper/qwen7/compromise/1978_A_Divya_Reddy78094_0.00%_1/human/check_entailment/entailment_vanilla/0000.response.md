### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to divide `n` books into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the highest-numbered book in each pile is maximized.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the two largest numbers in the sorted list of books.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page counts `nums`.
   - It sorts the list of page counts in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the first two elements in the sorted list, i.e., `nums[0] + nums[1]`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the list in descending order ensures that the two largest numbers are at the beginning of the list.
   - Taking the sum of the first two elements (`nums[0] + nums[1]`) gives us the maximum possible sum of the highest-numbered books in two non-empty piles.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the edge case where there are only two books correctly because the sum of the first two elements will be the only possible sum.
   - For more than two books, the logic still holds since the two largest numbers will always be at the start after sorting.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles.

**Correctness: True**
