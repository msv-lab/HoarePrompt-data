Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing a subarray of the original array `a`, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (starting from the most significant bit to the least significant bit), `x` is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0.**

The code initializes `thing1` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or the state of the arrays. Therefore, all other variables retain their initial states.
