State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be at least 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine the number of iterations.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` generates a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. The variables `start` and `end` are not used in the loop condition or within the loop body, so they do not need to be adjusted.
4. The variable `t` must be set to a value that ensures the loop can execute, which means `t` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be at least 1.
