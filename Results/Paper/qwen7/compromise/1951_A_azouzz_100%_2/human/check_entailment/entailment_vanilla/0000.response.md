### Reasoning:

The provided program consists of two functions: `generate_files_for_html_in_range` and `func_1`. The task is to determine if the given program is correct based on the provided problem description.

1. **Function `generate_files_for_html_in_range`:**
   - This function is designed to generate `.ac.py` and `.wa.py` files for each `.html` file in subdirectories whose names fall within a specified range.
   - It correctly iterates through all subdirectories in the current working directory.
   - It checks if the subdirectory name is a digit and falls within the specified range (`start` to `end`).
   - For each qualifying subdirectory, it lists all `.html` files and generates corresponding `.ac.py` and `.wa.py` files.
   - The code prints the number of `.html` files found in each qualifying subdirectory and the paths of the generated `.ac.py` and `.wa.py` files.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is not part of the original problem description and appears to be unrelated to the task of generating files for HTML directories.
   - It reads input from the user, processes a string `s`, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions related to the count of '1's in the string and the presence of '11' in the string.
   - Since this function is not relevant to the task of generating files for HTML directories, its correctness does not affect the overall correctness of the program in the context of the given problem.

3. **Main Execution:**
   - The main execution block calls `generate_files_for_html_in_range` with the specified range (1951 to 1980).
   - This call is correct and should execute the intended functionality.

Given that the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is implemented correctly according to the problem description and the `func_1` function, while being irrelevant to the task, does not affect the correctness of the primary functionality.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
