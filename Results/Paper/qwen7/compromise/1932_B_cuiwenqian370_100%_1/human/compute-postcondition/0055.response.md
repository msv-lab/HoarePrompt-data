Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `last_year` is equal to `next_year`
   - `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body (based on the given information).
   - `last_year` and `next_year` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop body either.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now 3
   - `n` must still be greater than 1
   - `last_year` is still equal to `next_year`
   - `next_year` is still equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])**
