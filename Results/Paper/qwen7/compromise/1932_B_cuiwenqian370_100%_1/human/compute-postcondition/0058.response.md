Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to (((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])), `last_year` is equal to (((`last_year` + a[2]) // a[2] * a[2])).

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `last_year` will be equal to `next_year`, which will be the result of the final computation inside the loop. This final value of `next_year` is derived from the initial value of `last_year` and the third element of the list `a` (`a[2]`).
