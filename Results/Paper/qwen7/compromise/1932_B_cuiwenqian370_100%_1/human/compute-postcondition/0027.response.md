Output State: **`index` is increased by 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer from the input, `last_year` is the result of applying the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` starting with the initial value of `last_year`, `results` is a list containing a single string element which is the final value of `last_year` converted to a string, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input data starting from `data[index]` and having a length of `n`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` creates a list `a` by converting the elements in the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` (inclusive) into integers. The values of `index`, `i`, `n`, `last_year`, `results`, and `T` remain unchanged from their initial states.
