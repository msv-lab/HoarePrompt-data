Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to (((...((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]) + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3] * a[3]) ... + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]).

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `last_year` will be equal to `next_year`, which will be the result of applying the loop's operation iteratively from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`. Specifically, `next_year` will be the final value obtained by successively updating `last_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
