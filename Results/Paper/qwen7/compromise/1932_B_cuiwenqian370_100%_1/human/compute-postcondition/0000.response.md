Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n` where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6, and the input reading method is changed to `sys.stdin.read`**.

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` changes the way input is read from standard input to using `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input as a single string. However, this does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n`. Therefore, these values remain as described in the initial state.
