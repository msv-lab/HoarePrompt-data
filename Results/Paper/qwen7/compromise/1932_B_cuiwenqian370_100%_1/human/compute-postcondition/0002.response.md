Output State: **`index` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `data` is a list of `n` strings obtained from splitting the input.**

The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `data` remain unchanged from their initial states.
