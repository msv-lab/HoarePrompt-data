Output State: **`index` is 2, `T` is an integer from the list `data`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.**

The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `T`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
