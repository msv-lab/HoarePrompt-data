Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `last_year` to be equal to `next_year`. The calculation for `next_year` is given as `(last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`. However, since `last_year` is now set to `next_year`, the value of `last_year` is updated to whatever the value of `next_year` was calculated to be. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
