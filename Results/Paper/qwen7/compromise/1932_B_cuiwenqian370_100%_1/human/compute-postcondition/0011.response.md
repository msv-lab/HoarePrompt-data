Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `index` is increased by `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `last_year` is the first element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `last_year`. The values of `T`, `n`, `index`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. The only new information is that `last_year` is now equal to `a[0]`.
