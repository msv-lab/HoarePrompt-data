Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is the final value obtained by successively updating `last_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and `results` contains a string representation of `next_year` repeated `T` times.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `last_year` will be the same as `next_year` and will be the result of applying the given formula for each element in the list `a` for all iterations specified by `T`. The `results` list will contain this final value of `last_year` converted to a string and repeated `T` times, as the loop appends the final `last_year` value to the `results` list in each iteration.
