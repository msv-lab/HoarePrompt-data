Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must be true.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2 (i.e., `i = 1 + 1`).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body. It must still be greater than 1.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` changes from 1 to 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - The values of `last_year` and `next_year` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`**
