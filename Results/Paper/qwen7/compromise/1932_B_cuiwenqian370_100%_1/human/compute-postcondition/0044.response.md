Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is 4, `next_year` is 4, `a[1]` remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the string "4", `index` is increased by 1.**

The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `i`, `last_year`, `next_year`, `a[1]`, and `results` remain unchanged from their initial states.
