Output State: **`index` is increased by `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is the result of applying the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` starting with the initial value of `last_year`, `results` is a list containing a single string element which is the final value of `last_year` converted to a string, `T` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input data starting from `data[index]` and having a length of `n`.**

Explanation: The line `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. The values of `i`, `last_year`, `results`, `T`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
