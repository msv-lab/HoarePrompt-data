Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `data` is a list of `n` strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
