Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of grid dimensions \(h\) and \(w\), and two points \((x_a, y_a)\) and \((x_b, y_b)\). For each test case, it determines the winner based on the relative positions of these points within the grid. If \(x_a\) is greater than \(x_b\), it outputs 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the midpoint between \(x_a\) and \(x_b\) and checks the vertical positions of \((x_a, y_a)\) and \((x_b, y_b)\) to decide between 'Alice' and 'Bob'. The function outputs a series of lines, each containing 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', corresponding to the outcome of each test case.**
