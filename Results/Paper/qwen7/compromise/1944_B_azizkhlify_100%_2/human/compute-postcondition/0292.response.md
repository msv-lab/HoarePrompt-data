Output State: **`i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`, and `n` is at least 1; `l[a[i] - 1]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] = 0` updates the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Since `a[i] - 1` was previously equal to 2 (as per the initial condition), now `l[2]` is 0. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
