Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in res:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `res`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `res` is `[a[0], a[0]]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `res` that can be assigned to `i`. Since `i` is iterating over the elements of `res`, the loop will stop when `i` has gone through all elements of `res`.

4. **Check the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, meaning it has iterated over the first element of `res`. Therefore, the next iteration would set `i` to the second element of `res`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will now be the second element of `res`, which is `a[0]`.
   - `res` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.

6. **Formulate the new state**: The new state should reflect that `i` is now the second element of `res`, and `res` remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `a[0]`, `res` is `[a[0], a[0]]`**
