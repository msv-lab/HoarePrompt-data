Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n + 1` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n + 2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < 2 * n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `2 * n`. Given that `i` is currently `n + 1`, the next value of `i` will be `n + 2`, and for the loop to continue, `n + 2` must still be less than `2 * n`.

5. **Maintain the condition for `n`**: Since `n` must be greater than 0, it remains the same.

6. **Adjust `r[a[i] - 1]`**: The increment operation happens inside the loop body, but since we are adjusting the state before the loop body, we don't need to change this part directly. However, we should ensure that the index `a[i] - 1` is valid for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `n + 2`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration (but its exact value is not specified)

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1**
