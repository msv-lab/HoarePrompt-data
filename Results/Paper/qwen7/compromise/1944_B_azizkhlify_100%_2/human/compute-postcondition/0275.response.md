Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making `i` equal to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0.

6. **Consider the list `l[a[0] - 1]`**: The value of `l[a[0] - 1]` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, but this does not affect the loop condition directly. Therefore, it remains unchanged.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
