Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `2 * n`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- If `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ul` is incremented by 2
- If `ul` does not equal `k * 2`, the values of `i`, `n`, and `ul` remain unchanged

The `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space. Since `i` is `2 * n`, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `2 * n` in the list `a`.

However, the values of `a`, `l`, `ul`, and `k` are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]`. We can only describe it in terms of the index.

Output: **a[2 * n], a[2 * n]**
