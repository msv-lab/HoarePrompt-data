Output State: **`i` is `2 * n`, `re` is incremented by 1 to equal `k + 1`, `ul` is initialized to a value that allows the loop to break when `ul` equals `k * 2`, and `k` is non-zero.**

Explanation: The code `re += 1` increments the value of `re` by 1. Since `re` was initially incremented by 1 to equal `k`, the new value of `re` is `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
