Output State: **After all iterations, `i` is equal to `2 * n`, `n` is less than `2 * n`, `ur` is increased by 2 for each iteration where the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` is met, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0 for those specific indices. If `ul` equals `ur` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks early.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n`.
- The variable `n` will still be less than `2 * n`.
- For each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, `ur` will have been incremented by 2 and `r[a[i] - 1]` will be set to 0.
- If `ul` ever equals `ur` during the loop, the loop will stop before completing all iterations.
