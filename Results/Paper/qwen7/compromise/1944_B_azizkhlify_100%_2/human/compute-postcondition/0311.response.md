Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is at least 1
   - `ul` is equal to `k * 2` + 2 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range of `n`.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, after incrementing, `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a condition for the loop to continue.
   - `ul` remains unchanged as there is no operation inside the loop that affects `ul`.

4. **Final States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 1.
   - `ul` will remain as per its initial value, which is `k * 2` + 2 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is at least 1, and `ul` is equal to `k * 2` + 2 if `l[a[1] - 1]` is 2, otherwise `ul` remains unchanged.**
