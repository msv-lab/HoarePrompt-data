Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0, so `i` will be an odd number (since `2 * n - 1` always results in an odd number).
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is equal to 2. This means that the element `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is 2.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Given these details, let's determine the value of `a[i]`:
- Since `l[a[i] - 1] = 2`, it implies that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is 2.
- Therefore, `a[i] - 1` must be the index of the element in list `l` that is 2, meaning `a[i] = 3`.

So, the print statement will print `3` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **3 3**
