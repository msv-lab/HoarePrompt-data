Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` by 1. Since `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` is `a[1]`. Therefore, `l[a[1] - 1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
