Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is the sixth element from `res`, `n` must be less than or equal to the fifth element from `res`, and `2 * n` must be greater than the fifth element from `res`; if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ur` is increased by 2 and `ul` equals `ur`. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `res`, `a`, `r`, `ur`, or `ul`. It only indicates that the program exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is in. Therefore, the postconditions and preconditions remain the same, and the only change is that the program breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
