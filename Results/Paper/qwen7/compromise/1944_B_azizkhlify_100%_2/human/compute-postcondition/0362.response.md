Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `res`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `res` contains at least one element.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `res` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `res` must still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `res` in the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `res`.
   - `res` must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`res` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element of `res`**
