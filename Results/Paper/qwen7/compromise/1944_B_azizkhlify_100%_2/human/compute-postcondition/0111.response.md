Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `ur` is increased by either 2 or 4.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0.
- `x` is an integer.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then `ur` is increased by 4 and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0.
- If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `ur` is increased by 2 and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0.

### Loop Condition:
- The loop runs from `i` in the range `n` to `2 * n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Range of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = n` and ends with `i = 2 * n - 1`.
   - Therefore, the current value of `i` at the start of the next iteration will be `i + 1`.

2. **Adjust `ur` and `r[a[i] - 1]`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, the condition for updating `ur` and `r[a[i] - 1]` will be based on the new value of `i`.

3. **Check the Condition for Incrementing `ur`:**
   - If `ul` is equal to `ur`, then `ur` is increased by 4.
   - If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then `ur` is increased by 2.
   - Both conditions result in `r[a[i] - 1]` being set to 0.

### Updated States:
- `ur` will be updated based on the condition (either by 2 or 4).
- `r[a[i] - 1]` will be set to 0.
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `a` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not involved in the loop condition.

### Final State:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `ur` will be updated according to the condition.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` will be set to 0.

### Answer:
State: **`ur` is increased by either 2 or 4 (depending on the condition), `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers.**

Given the initial state and the loop condition, the final state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`ur` is increased by either 2 or 4, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers.**
