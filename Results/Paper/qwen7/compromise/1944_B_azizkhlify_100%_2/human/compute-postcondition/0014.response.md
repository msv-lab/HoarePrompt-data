Output State: All indices `i` from 0 to `n-1` have been iterated over; `n` must be greater than 0; each element `l[a[i] - 1]` in the list `l` has been incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `a[i]` in the list `a`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `l` will contain the count of how many times each index (from 0 to max value in list `a`) appears in the list `a`.
