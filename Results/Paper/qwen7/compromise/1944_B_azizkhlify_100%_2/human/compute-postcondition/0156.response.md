Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 0, but its exact value is not needed for this specific print statement.
- `i` is 0.
- The value of `a[i]` is used to index `l` and the element at that index is 2.

This means that `a[0]` (since `i` is 0) is used to index `l`, and the element at that index in `l` is 2.

Therefore, the print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **2 2**
