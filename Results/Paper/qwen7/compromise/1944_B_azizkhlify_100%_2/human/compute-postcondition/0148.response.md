Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n, 2 * n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - The state of `r[a[i] - 1]` does not need to be adjusted because it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
