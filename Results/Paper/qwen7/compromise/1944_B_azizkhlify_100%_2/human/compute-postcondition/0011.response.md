Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 (which means `l[a[1] - 1]` is incremented by 1 since `i` was 1)

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Consider the effect of the loop body**:
   - The loop body increments `l[a[i] - 1]`, which means `l[a[2] - 1]` will be incremented by 1 if the loop executes again.

However, since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration based on the loop head, we focus on `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
