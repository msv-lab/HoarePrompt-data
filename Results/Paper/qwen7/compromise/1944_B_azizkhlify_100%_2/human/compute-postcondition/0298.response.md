Output State: **`i` is within the range `0` to `n-1`, and `n` is at least 1; `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or the most internal if statement. Since the `break` statement does not modify the values of `i`, `n`, or `ul`, these variables retain their original values from the precondition.
