Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l[a[1] - 1]` is incremented by 1 (this information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop head variables).

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0.

So, the final state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2**
