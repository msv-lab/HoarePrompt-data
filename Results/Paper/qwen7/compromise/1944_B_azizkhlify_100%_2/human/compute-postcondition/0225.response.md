Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `res` is a non-empty iterable containing `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[3]`.
  - `i` is 3.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in res:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the iterable `res`.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the iterable `res`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, which means `i` has taken the value from the iterable `res`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next element from `res` must be assigned to `i`.
   - Since `res` is a non-empty iterable, it contains at least one element.
   - The current value of `i` is 3, which suggests that `i` has already taken the first three values from `res`.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - The next element from `res` will be assigned to `i`.
   - Therefore, `i` will take the next value from `res`.
   - Since `res` is a non-empty iterable and `i` was 3, the next value in `res` must be the fourth element (assuming the elements are indexed starting from 0).

### Conclusion:
- The state needs to be adjusted such that `i` takes the next value from `res`, which is the fourth element.

### Final State:
- `res` remains a non-empty iterable.
- `i` is now the fourth element from `res`.

**State: **`res` is a non-empty iterable, `i` is the fourth element from `res`**.
