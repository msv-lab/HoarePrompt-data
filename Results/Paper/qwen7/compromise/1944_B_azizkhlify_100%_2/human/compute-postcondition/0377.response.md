Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be less than `2 * n`. The condition `ul` is equal to `ur` holds true.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, it does not modify any variable values but instead breaks out of the loop or case it is inside. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, the values of `i`, `n`, `r`, `a`, `ur`, `ul` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed. The conditions `i == n`, `n < 2 * n`, and `ul == ur` still hold true.
