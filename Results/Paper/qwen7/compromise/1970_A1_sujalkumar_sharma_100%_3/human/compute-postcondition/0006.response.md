Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples sorted by the first element (current balance) in ascending order and by the second element (index `i`) in descending order within tuples having the same first element; `balance` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `prefix_balance` list based on the first element of each tuple (current balance) in ascending order. If two tuples have the same balance, they are further sorted by the second element (index `i`) in descending order. The length of the string `s` (`n`) and the content of `s` remain unchanged, and `balance` remains 0 as no assignment operation was performed on it.
