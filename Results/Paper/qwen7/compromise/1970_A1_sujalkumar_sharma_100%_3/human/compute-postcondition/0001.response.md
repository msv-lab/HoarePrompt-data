Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `prefix_balance` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `prefix_balance`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, `s` remains a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and `n` remains the length of the string `s`. The new variable `prefix_balance` is an empty list.
