Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - For each outcome \(i\), the player bets \(x_i\) coins, and if outcome \(i\) wins, the player receives \(k_i \cdot x_i\) coins.
   - The goal is to find \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i < k_i \cdot x_i\) for all \(i\).

3. **Solution Approach**:
   - The solution multiplies all \(k_i\) values to get \(M = k_1 \cdot k_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot k_n\).
   - Each \(x_i\) is calculated as \(M / k_i\).
   - The greatest common factor (GCD) of these \(x_i\) values is computed using `func_1`.
   - If the sum of the scaled \(x_i\) values divided by the GCD is still greater than or equal to \(M / \text{GCD}\), the distribution is invalid, and `-1` is printed.
   - Otherwise, the scaled \(x_i\) values are printed.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the GCD of a list of numbers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
   - The logic is sound and correctly implements the GCD calculation.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the case where the sum of scaled \(x_i\) values divided by the GCD is still too large, correctly returning `-1`.
   - The solution ensures that the distribution is valid by checking the sum condition after scaling and dividing by the GCD.

6. **Code Review**:
   - The code correctly implements the logic described above.
   - The use of GCD ensures that the solution is optimal and adheres to the constraints.
   - The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
