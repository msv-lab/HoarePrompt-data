#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, …, k_n where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func_1(numbers):
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: The greatest common factor (`hcf`) of all the elements in the list `numbers`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
    #
    #Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, the variable `hcf` will hold the greatest common factor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `numbers`. This is because the loop iteratively updates `hcf` to be the GCD of `hcf` and each subsequent element in the list. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common factor (GCD) of all the elements in the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers named 'numbers' and calculates the greatest common factor (GCD) of all the elements in the list. It then returns this GCD value.
