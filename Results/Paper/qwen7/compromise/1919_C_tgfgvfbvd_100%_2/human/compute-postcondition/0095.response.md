Output State: **`x` is `n`, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` remains the same, `c` is `c + 2`**

Explanation: The variable `c` was initially set to `c + 1`. After executing `c += 1`, the value of `c` is incremented by 1 again, making it `c + 2`. The values of `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
