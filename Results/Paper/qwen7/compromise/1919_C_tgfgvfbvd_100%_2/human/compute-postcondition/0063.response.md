Output State: **`x` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `a` is greater than `b`, and `b` is equal to the original value of `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the value of `l[x]` to `a`. Since `x` is `n-1`, `a` becomes `l[n-1]`. The condition that `a` is greater than `b` is still valid. Additionally, since `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` (which is now `l[n-1]`), the value of `a` remains unchanged, and `b` becomes equal to the original value of `a`.
