Postcondition: `a` and `b` are swapped, meaning `a` is now equal to the original value of `b` and `b` is now equal to the original value of `a`. `n` remains greater than 0. If `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b` (original value of `a`), then `l[x]` equals `b` (original value of `a`), and `c` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is equal to `l[x]`, `b` is still equal to the original value of `a`, `n` remains greater than 0, and `c` is increased by 1.
