Output State: **`x` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is now equal to `l[n-1]`, `b` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the value of `l[x]` to `a`. Given that `x` is `n-1`, `a` is now set to the value of `l[n-1]`. The value of `b` remains unchanged, and the conditions for `n` and `x` are still valid.
