Output State: **`x` is `n`, `a` and `b` are swapped, `c` is `c + 1`, `b` is `l[n]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `b = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `b`. Since `x` is `n`, `b` is now set to `l[n]`. The other conditions (swapping of `a` and `b`, incrementing `c`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
