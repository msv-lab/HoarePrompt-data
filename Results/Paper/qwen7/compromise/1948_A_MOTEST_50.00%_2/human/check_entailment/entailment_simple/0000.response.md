### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input where `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is the required number of special characters.

2. **Special Character Definition**: A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This definition is correctly implemented in the logic.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case when `n == 1`, printing "NO" as specified.

4. **Even `n` Case**:
   - When `n` is even, the program constructs a string with alternating characters from the set of uppercase Latin letters. This ensures that every character except the first and last will have exactly one neighbor that is different, making them special characters. The first and last characters will also be special since they do not have two neighbors.

5. **Odd `n` Case**:
   - When `n` is odd, the program starts with "AAA" to ensure the first three characters are special. Then it alternates the remaining characters as before. This approach ensures that all but the first and last characters are special, and the first and last characters are also special due to the structure of the string.

6. **Output Formatting**: The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string for valid cases and "NO" for invalid cases, which matches the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate strings with the specified properties and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
