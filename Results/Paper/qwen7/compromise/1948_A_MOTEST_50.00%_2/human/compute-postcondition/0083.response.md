Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0, `x` is 0, `ans` is 's[0]*2'**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of string `s`, multiplied by 2, to the end of the string `ans`. Since `x` is initially 0, `ans` becomes `'s[0]*2'`. The values of `n`, `j`, and `x` remain unchanged.
