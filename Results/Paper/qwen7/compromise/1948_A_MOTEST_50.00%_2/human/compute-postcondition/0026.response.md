Output State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1, `s` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is incremented by 1, but the initial state of `ans` being the original value of `ans` plus 2 times the value of `s[x]` remains unchanged because the calculation for `ans` was based on the previous value of `x`. The variable `s` and the original value of `ans` plus 2 times the value of `s[x]` before the increment of `x` are unaffected.
