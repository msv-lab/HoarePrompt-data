Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 2 if `t` was 1 or 4 if `t` was 3.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `ans` is 's[x]s[x]', where `x` is 4.
   - `x` is 4.
   - `j` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n // 2`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n // 2`.
   - Since `j` starts at 0, it will increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, after the first iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must be at least 2 (as given), and `j` must be less than `n // 2`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` must remain at least 2.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 2 if `t` was 1 or 4 if `t` was 3, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 's[x]s[x]', `x` is 4, `j` is 1**
