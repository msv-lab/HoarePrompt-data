Output State: **All iterations of the loop have completed.**

In the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, the following conditions hold:

- The variable `t` will still be the initial value it had before the loop started, which is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 50.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `t` because the loop runs `t` times.
- For each iteration `i` of the loop, `n` was an integer input that was not equal to 1.
- The variable `ans` will be constructed based on the value of `n`:
  - If `n` is even, `ans` will be a string where each character from `s` (which contains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ') is repeated twice, up to `n // 2` times.
  - If `n` is odd and greater than 1, `ans` will start with 'AAA' followed by characters from `s` repeated twice, up to `n // 2 - 1` times.
- The variable `x` will be set to `n // 2` if `n` is even, or to 3 if `n` is odd and greater than 1.
- The variable `j` will be `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, or `n // 2 - 2` if `n` is odd and greater than 1.
- After all iterations, the output will consist of `t` lines. Each line will start with 'YES' followed by the corresponding `ans` string for that iteration.
