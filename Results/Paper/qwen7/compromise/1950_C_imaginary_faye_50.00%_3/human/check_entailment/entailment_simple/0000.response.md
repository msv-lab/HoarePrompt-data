Reasoning:

1. The function `func_1()` correctly processes each test case by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processing each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the time string `s` in the format "hh:mm".
3. It extracts the hour part `h` from the string `s`.
4. It then determines whether the hour is in the AM or PM period:
   - If the hour is '00', it prints '12' followed by the minutes and 'AM'.
   - If the hour is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour followed by the minutes and 'AM'.
   - If the hour is between '13' and '23', it calculates the equivalent hour in the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from the hour and adds a leading zero if necessary, followed by the minutes and 'PM'.
5. The output format matches the required format: "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM".

Given the above analysis, the function correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format according to the rules specified.

Correctness: **True**
