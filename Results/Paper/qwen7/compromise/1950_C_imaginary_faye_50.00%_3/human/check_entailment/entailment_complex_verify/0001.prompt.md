You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 6 (including the AM/PM indicator) representing the formatted time in the 12-hour format based on the original input time in the 24-hour format. The first two characters of s represent the hour in the 12-hour format, followed by ":", then the original minutes from the input time, and finally either "AM" or "PM" depending on whether the original hour was 12 or greater than 12.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a string `s` representing a time in the 24-hour format. For each test case, it converts the time from the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format and prints the formatted time along with "AM" or "PM". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the formatted times for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined correctly to handle the logic for converting 24-hour time to 12-hour time.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.

3. **Hour Conversion Logic**:
   - The hour part `h` is extracted from the string `s`.
   - If `h` is `'00'`, it is converted to `'12'` because midnight in 24-hour format is `00:00` and in 12-hour format it is `12:00 AM`.
   - If `h` is between `'01'` and `'12'`, it remains the same.
   - If `h` is greater than `'12'`, it is converted by subtracting `12` and adding a leading zero if necessary. For example, `'13'` becomes `'01'` and `'23'` becomes `'11'`.

4. **AM/PM Determination**:
   - The program checks if the hour is greater than or equal to `'12'`. If true, it prints `'PM'`; otherwise, it prints `'AM'`.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the formatted time in the 12-hour format followed by either `'AM'` or `'PM'`.

### Example Walkthrough:
- **Input**: `09:41`
  - Hour: `'09'` (which is less than `'12'`)
  - Output: `09:41 AM`
- **Input**: `18:06`
  - Hour: `'18'` (which is greater than `'12'`)
  - Output: `06:06 PM`
- **Input**: `12:14`
  - Hour: `'12'`
  - Output: `12:14 PM`
- **Input**: `00:59`
  - Hour: `'00'` (which is `'12'` in 12-hour format)
  - Output: `12:59 AM`

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the logic for converting 24-hour time to 12-hour time. It also formats the output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
