You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Program:
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (*_, k) = R()
        a = {*R()}
        b = {*R()}
        f = 1
        m = n = k // 2
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            u = i in a
            v = i in b
            f &= u | v
            m -= u & ~v
            n -= ~u & v
        print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a value `k`, then two sets `a` and `b` from standard input. It then iterates through numbers from 1 to `k`, checking if each number is in `a` or `b`. Based on these checks, it calculates and updates values `f`, `m`, and `n`. Finally, it prints either "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions involving `f`, `m`, and `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The program attempts to use sets to check for the existence of elements within specified ranges and then tries to determine if there are two different elements within those ranges. However, the logic used to determine the presence of different elements is flawed.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The expected output for this input should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

This is incorrect because for the query `1 2`, there are no two different elements in the range `[1, 2]`. The program incorrectly returns `1 3` for the query `1 3` because it checks the entire range from `1` to `3` instead of just the sub-range `[1, 3]`.

The program also does not handle the queries correctly for ranges that do not contain enough elements to satisfy the condition. For example, for the query `1 2`, the program should output `-1 -1` since there are no two different elements in the range `[1, 2]`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
