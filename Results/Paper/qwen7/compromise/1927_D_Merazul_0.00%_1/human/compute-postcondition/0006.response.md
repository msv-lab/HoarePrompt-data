Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `k` is the second element of `R()`, `a` is a set containing one element from `R()`, `b` is a set containing one element from `R()`**

Explanation: The code `b = {*R()}` creates a set `b` by calling the function `R()` and converting its result into a set using the set comprehension syntax `{*R()}`. Since `R()` returns a single element, `b` will be a set containing one element from `R()`. The values of `t`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
