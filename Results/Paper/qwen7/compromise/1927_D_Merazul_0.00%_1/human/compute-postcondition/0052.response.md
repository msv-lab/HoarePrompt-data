Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` must be at least 2, `u` is True, `f` is `f & (True | v)`, `m` is `m - (True & ~v)`, `n` is `n - (~True & v)`, `v` is `i in b`, `v` is `i in b**.

Explanation: The code `v = i in b` assigns the value of `i in b` to `v`. Since the value of `i` is 3, `v` will be `3 in b`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `k`, `u`, `f`, `m`, `n`) remain unchanged.
