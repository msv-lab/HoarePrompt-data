Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `k + 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` must be at least 1
   - `u` is False
   - `f` is `v`
   - `m` is `m`
   - `n` is `n - 0` or simply `n` since `~u & v` is `False` and subtracting `False` (interpreted as `0`) does not change the value of `n`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged.
   - The other variables (`u`, `f`, `m`, `n`) remain the same because they are not affected by the loop.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `2`.
   - `k` remains the same (at least 1).
   - `u`, `f`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be at least 1, `u` is False, `f` is `v`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`**
