Output State: **`t` is equal to its original value minus 1, `k` is the second element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `a` is a set containing the elements of the tuple returned by `R()`**.

Explanation: The code `a = {*R()}` creates a set `a` from the elements of the tuple returned by the function `R()`. The variable `t` is updated to its original value minus 1, and `k` remains unchanged as it was defined as the second element of the tuple returned by `R()` before the new set was created.
