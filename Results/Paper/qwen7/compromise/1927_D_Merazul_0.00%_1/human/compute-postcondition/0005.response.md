Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `k` is the second element of `R()`, `a` is a set containing one element from `R()`**

Explanation: 
- The variable `t` is updated to `t - 2`.
- The variable `k` remains unchanged and is still the second element of `R()`.
- The variable `a` is assigned a set containing one element from the function `R()`. Since `R()` returns a single value, `a` becomes a set with that single value.
