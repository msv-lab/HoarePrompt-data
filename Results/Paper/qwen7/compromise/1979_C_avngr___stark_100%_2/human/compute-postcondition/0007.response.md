Output State: The `result` variable will hold the final value obtained by successively applying the `func_1` function to the initial `result` and each element in the `numbers` list, starting from the second element and moving to the end of the list.

In more detail, if the `numbers` list has \( n \) elements, the `result` will be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{result} = \text{func}_1(\ldots(\text{func}_1(\text{func}_1(\text{initial\_result}, \text{second\_element}), \text{third\_element}), \ldots), \text{last\_element}) \]

This means that `result` will be the cumulative result of applying `func_1` to the initial `result` and each subsequent element in the `numbers` list, from the second element to the last one.
