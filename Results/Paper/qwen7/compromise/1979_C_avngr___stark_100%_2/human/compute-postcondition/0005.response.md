Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, which means it starts from the second element of the `numbers` list.
   - The variable `num` is used in the loop.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `numbers` must have at least two elements.
   - `num` is the third element of `numbers`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts from the second element (`numbers[1]`) and continues as long as there are more elements in the list.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `num` must be the fourth element of `numbers` (since it started from the third element).
   - `numbers` must still have at least three elements left (because the loop starts from the second element and goes up to but does not include the last element).

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `numbers` must have at least three elements.
   - `num` is now the fourth element of `numbers`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`numbers` must have at least three elements, `num` is the fourth element of `numbers`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)`**
