Output State: **The program returns the cumulative result of applying the function `func_1` successively to pairs of consecutive elements from the `numbers` list, starting with the first element.**

This means that the program returns the final value of `result` which is calculated by successively applying the function `func_1` to pairs of consecutive elements from the `numbers` list, beginning with the first element. For example, if `numbers` is `[a, b, c, d]`, then `result` would be `func_1(func_1(func_1(a, b), c), d)`.
