Output State: **`numbers` must have at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)`**.

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(result, num)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1` with arguments `result` and `num` to the variable `result`. Since `num` is the second element of `numbers`, `result` now holds the return value of `func_1(result, num)`. All other preconditions remain unchanged.
