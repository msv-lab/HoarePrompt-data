Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem at hand. The problem requires distributing bets in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. The given functions seem to be related to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of a set of numbers, which is not necessary for solving this specific problem.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find a way to distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for each outcome. Given the constraints, a simple approach would be to bet a fixed amount on each outcome, ensuring that the total bet is less than the reward for any single outcome. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def solve(test_case):
    n = test_case[0]
    multipliers = test_case[1]
    
    # Bet the same amount on each outcome
    # Since the maximum multiplier is 20, we can safely bet up to (multiplier - 1)
    # to ensure the total bet is less than the reward for any single outcome.
    bet_amount = 1
    while True:
        total_bet = bet_amount * n
        if all(total_bet < multiplier * bet_amount for multiplier in multipliers):
            break
        bet_amount += 1
    
    # Output the bet amounts
    print(' '.join(str(bet_amount) for _ in range(n)))

# Read input
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

# Process each test case
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    multipliers = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    solve([n, multipliers])

```

This program reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the required distribution of bets.
