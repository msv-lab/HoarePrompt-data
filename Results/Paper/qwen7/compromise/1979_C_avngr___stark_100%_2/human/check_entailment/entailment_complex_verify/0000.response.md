### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to distribute coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. This means for each \( k_i \), the sum of the bets on all outcomes must be less than \( k_i \times \text{bet on the } i\text{-th outcome} \).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the absolute value of the product of two numbers divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Given the constraints \( 2 \leq a, b \leq 20 \), the GCD of any two numbers in this range will be at most 20. Hence, the result of `func_1(a, b)` will be a number in the range \([1, 200]\).
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function applies `func_1` successively to all elements in the list. The final result is the cumulative application of `func_1` to all pairs of consecutive elements. Given the constraints, the result of `func_2(numbers)` will be a large number, but it doesn't directly relate to the problem requirements.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the program reads the input and initializes variables.
   - For each test case, it computes `m` using `func_2(k)`.
   - It then calculates `c` as `m // k[i]` for each outcome.
   - It checks if the sum of `c` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints `-1`, otherwise, it prints the values of `c`.

4. **Key Points**:
   - The computation of `m` using `func_2(k)` does not directly address the problem requirements.
   - The division `m // k[i]` might not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.
   - There is no explicit check or calculation to ensure the total bet is less than the winnings for each outcome.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. The use of `func_1` and `func_2` does not align with the problem's requirements. The logic to ensure the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome is missing.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the given problem.

**Final: False**
