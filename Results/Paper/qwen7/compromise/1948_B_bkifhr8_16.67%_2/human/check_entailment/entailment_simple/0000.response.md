### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, the program reads the array `list1` and checks if it can be sorted by repeatedly applying the given operation. However, the implementation of the operation itself has some issues:
   - The operation is only applied if the previous element is greater than the current element and is at least 10. This logic is correct.
   - When the operation is applied, the element is split into its constituent digits and inserted back into the list. This is also correct.
   - The main issue lies in the fact that the program does not ensure that the operation is applied optimally to achieve a sorted array. It simply applies the operation once and checks if the array is sorted after that. This may not always lead to the correct result.

3. **Sorting Check**: The function `func_1` checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is correct.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, it does not ensure that the array can be transformed into a sorted array through multiple operations. It only checks after one potential operation.

### Example Analysis:

- **Example 1**: The input is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. After splitting `45` into `[4, 5]`, the array becomes `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`. Then, splitting `67` into `[6, 7]` results in `[12, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted. The program would correctly identify this as `YES`.

- **Example 2**: The input is `[12, 28, 5]`. No matter how many times you apply the operation, you cannot sort the array. The program should correctly identify this as `NO`.

- **Example 3**: The input is `[0, 0]`. The array is already sorted, so the program correctly identifies this as `YES`.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic for applying the operation and checking if the array can be sorted is flawed. It only checks after one potential operation, which may not be sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted through multiple operations. Therefore, the program may give incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Correctness:

**False**
