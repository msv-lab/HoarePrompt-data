### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's break down the analysis step by step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the array for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the array and checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, the program attempts to split the previous element into its individual digits and insert them back into the array. However, the implementation of this logic is flawed.

3. **Issues in the Program:**
   - **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits:**
     - The current implementation directly modifies the array by popping and inserting elements, but it does not ensure that the digits are inserted in the correct positions. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program would attempt to insert `4` and `5` before `3`, which is incorrect.
   - **Assumption of Immediate Sorting:**
     - The program assumes that after performing the digit-splitting operation, the array will be sorted immediately. However, this is not always true because the relative order of other elements in the array may still be incorrect.
   - **Lack of Handling Edge Cases:**
     - The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with leading zeros or negative numbers, which are not specified in the problem but could affect the sorting process.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version. However, this function is called after the digit-splitting operation, which may not have resulted in a sorted array.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for splitting digits and the assumption that the array will be sorted immediately after the operation.
