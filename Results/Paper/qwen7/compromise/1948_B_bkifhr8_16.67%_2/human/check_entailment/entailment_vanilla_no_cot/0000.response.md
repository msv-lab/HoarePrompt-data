Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether the array can be sorted using the specified operations:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The code attempts to split elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and insert them back into the array. However, it does not handle the logic of performing these operations in a way that would ensure the array can eventually be sorted. Specifically, the code does not check if splitting an element helps in making the array sorted.

2. **Unnecessary Function Call**: The `func_1` function is called to check if the array is sorted after the operations. This function simply checks if the array is already sorted, but it does not account for the operations that might be needed to sort the array.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The main loop iterates through the array and tries to split elements greater than 10. However, it does not ensure that the resulting array can be sorted. Splitting an element without ensuring the array's sorted property is not sufficient.

4. **Missing Logic for Sorting**: The code does not implement the logic required to ensure that the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the allowed operations. It only checks if the array is sorted after a single pass of the operations, which is insufficient.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to implement a strategy that ensures the array can be transformed into a sorted array through the allowed operations. This might involve repeatedly applying the splitting operation until no further splits are possible and then checking if the array is sorted.
