You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50 inclusive.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each element in the array, starting from the second element (`p`), the program checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, the program splits the previous element into its individual digits and inserts them back into the array at the appropriate positions.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After processing all elements, the program calls a function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the given list is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - It returns `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits:**
   - The logic for splitting digits and inserting them back into the array is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the insertion of digits.
   - The current implementation directly modifies the array by popping and inserting elements, but it does not ensure that the digits are inserted in the correct positions.

2. **Assumption of Immediate Sorting:**
   - The program assumes that after performing the digit-splitting operation, the array will be sorted immediately. However, this is not always true because the relative order of other elements in the array may still be incorrect.

3. **Lack of Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with leading zeros or negative numbers, which are not specified in the problem but could affect the sorting process.

### Conclusion

Given the issues mentioned above, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
