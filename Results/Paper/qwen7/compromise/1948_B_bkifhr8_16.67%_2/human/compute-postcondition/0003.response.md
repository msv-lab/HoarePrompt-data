Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers (`lst`) where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50 inclusive. It checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order and returns a boolean value (`True` if the list is sorted, `False` otherwise).**
