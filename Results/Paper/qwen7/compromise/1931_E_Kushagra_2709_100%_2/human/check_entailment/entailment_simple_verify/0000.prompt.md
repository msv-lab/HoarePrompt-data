You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, nums):

    tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

#Function 2:
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        tot += 1
    return tot



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, nums))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of integers in the list, m is an integer determining when Sasha wins, and nums is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `cntvals` is a list of the counts of zeros in each integer of `nums`, sorted in descending order but with every second element removed; `tot` is reduced by the sum of the counts of zeros at even indices in `cntvals`; `n` is an integer representing the number of integers in the list, `m` is an integer determining when Sasha wins, and `nums` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #Sasha if the total (tot) is greater than or equal to m + 1, otherwise Anna

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9.
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        
        tot += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9; `tot` is the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the string `num` from the last character to the first. It increments `tot` each time it encounters a '0' at the current position. The loop breaks when it encounters the first non-zero digit. Therefore, `tot` will be the count of trailing zeros in `num`.
    return tot
    #The program returns the count of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules described. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `zerocnts` do not accurately simulate the game's logic. Here’s why:

1. **Game Logic Mismatch**: The functions do not properly simulate the turns of Anna and Sasha as described. Anna reverses the digits of an element, and Sasha concatenates two elements. The provided functions do not handle these operations correctly.

2. **Evaluation Criteria**: The functions `func_1` and `zerocnts` do not evaluate the game state according to the rules. They seem to be attempting to calculate something related to the number of trailing zeros in the numbers, but this is not aligned with the game's objective of determining the winner based on the remaining number after Anna's last move.

3. **No Simulation of Moves**: There is no simulation of the turns where Anna and Sasha make their respective moves. The functions do not reduce the list size as Anna's moves decrease the number of elements, and they do not handle Sasha's concatenation moves.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus cannot be considered correct. A correct implementation would need to simulate the turns and evaluate the final state of the list after Anna's last move.
