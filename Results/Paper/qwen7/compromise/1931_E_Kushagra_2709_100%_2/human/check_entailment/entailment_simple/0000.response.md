Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game where players take turns modifying a list of integers according to specific rules. The goal is to determine the winner based on the final state of the list after optimal play.

2. **Key Points**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of an element.
   - Sasha concatenates two elements.
   - The game ends when only one element remains and Sasha wins if this element is at least \(10^m\).

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**:
     - Computes the total length of the numbers in the list.
     - Counts the number of trailing zeros in each number.
     - Removes every second highest zero count from the sorted list.
     - Determines the winner based on whether the adjusted total length is at least \(m+1\).
   - **zerocnts**:
     - Counts the trailing zeros in a single number.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **zerocnts**:
     - The logic correctly counts trailing zeros by iterating from the end of the string representation of the number.
   - **func_1**:
     - The logic to adjust the total length by removing every second highest zero count seems incorrect. The intention might be to simulate the game's effect on the total length, but the implementation does not align with the game's rules.
     - The condition `if tot >= m + 1` should consider the remaining elements and their lengths after optimal play, not just the zero counts.
     - The function should consider the final state of the list after all possible moves, not just the zero counts.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution does not correctly implement the game's rules and logic. The function `func_1` incorrectly handles the zero counts and does not reflect the actual game state.

Correctness: **False**
