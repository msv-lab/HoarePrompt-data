### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Anna reverses the digits of an element.
   - Sasha concatenates two elements and removes them, reducing the list size by one.
   - The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, meaning only one element remains.
   - Sasha wins if the remaining element is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (number of elements), `m` (threshold for Sasha to win), and `nums` (list of integers).
   - It calculates the total length of the numbers in the list (`tot`).
   - It counts the number of trailing zeros in each number using `zerocnts` and sorts these counts in descending order (`cntvals`).
   - It iterates over every pair of `cntvals`, subtracting the count of trailing zeros from `tot`.
   - If `tot` is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), it returns "Sasha"; otherwise, it returns "Anna".

3. **Analyzing `zerocnts`:**
   - `zerocnts` converts the number to a string and counts the number of trailing zeros.
   - This function correctly identifies the number of trailing zeros in a number.

4. **Game Outcome Determination:**
   - The logic in `func_1` attempts to determine if Sasha can force a win by ensuring the remaining number is large enough.
   - However, the logic is flawed because it doesn't fully account for the game mechanics where Sasha can always concatenate two numbers to reduce the list size.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The function `zerocnts` is correct.
   - The main function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that Sasha can always force a win by simply counting trailing zeros. This is not necessarily true because Sasha needs to strategically concatenate numbers to ensure the final number is large enough.

6. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` uses the total length of the numbers and the count of trailing zeros to make a decision. However, this approach does not consider the strategic nature of Sasha's moves.
   - Sasha can always concatenate two numbers to reduce the list size, and the goal is to ensure the final number is large enough. The current implementation does not capture this strategic aspect.
   - For example, consider a scenario where the list has multiple small numbers. Sasha can concatenate these small numbers to form a larger number, potentially making it larger than \(10^m\).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the game logic. The function `func_1` does not accurately determine the winner based on the rules provided.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
