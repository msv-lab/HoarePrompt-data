### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Anna reverses the digits of an element.
   - Sasha concatenates two elements and removes them, reducing the list size by one.
   - The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, meaning only one element remains.
   - Sasha wins if the remaining element is at least \(10^m\); otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (number of elements), `m` (threshold for Sasha to win), and `nums` (list of integers).
   - It calculates the total length of the numbers in the list (`tot`).
   - It counts the number of trailing zeros in each number using `zerocnts` and sorts these counts in descending order (`cntvals`).
   - It iterates over every pair of `cntvals`, subtracting the count of trailing zeros from `tot`.
   - If `tot` is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), it returns "Sasha"; otherwise, it returns "Anna".

3. **Analyzing `zerocnts`:**
   - `zerocnts` converts the number to a string and counts the number of trailing zeros.
   - This function correctly identifies the number of trailing zeros in a number.

4. **Game Outcome Determination:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not fully account for the game mechanics. Specifically, it does not consider the strategic nature of Sasha's moves and Anna's moves.
   - The function `zerocnts` is correct and used appropriately within `func_1`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The function `zerocnts` is correct.
   - The main function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that Sasha can always force a win by simply counting trailing zeros. This is not necessarily true because Sasha needs to strategically concatenate numbers to ensure the final number is large enough.
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game's strategic nature. Sasha's ability to concatenate numbers in a way that forces the final number to be large enough is not captured by simply counting trailing zeros.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the game logic. The function `func_1` does not accurately determine the winner based on the rules provided.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
