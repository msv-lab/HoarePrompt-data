Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer such that 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9; `tot` is the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the string `num` from the last character to the first. It increments `tot` each time it encounters a '0' at the current position. The loop breaks when it encounters the first non-zero digit. Therefore, `tot` will be the count of trailing zeros in `num`.
