Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, and for each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all i; and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` must still be greater than 0, `ans` will be the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` will be the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the value of each element from index 0 to index `x-1` in `a`, and this final value of `ans1` will be updated in each iteration according to the conditions inside the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the original value of `k`, `ans` will hold the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` calculated throughout the loop, `ans1` will be the adjusted sum of the list `a` as per the given logic, and no other variables outside the loop will change their values from their initial or previous states within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `k` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` after the loop has executed all iterations, `i` is 3 (or the last iteration index), and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` after the final iteration of the loop.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be reduced to 0 since it starts from a positive integer and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The variable `ans` will hold the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, where `ans1` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of `a` after processing all elements in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all its iterations, `k` is equal to the total number of iterations, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 4 + x, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of the list `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `a` adjusted for each iteration, and `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
