Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `ans1` is increased by `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments the value of `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. The precondition that `k` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `ans1` is updated, but the exact value depends on the current value of `ans1` and `a[i]`.
