Output State: **`k` is greater than or equal to 1, `ans1` is increased by `a[0] + a[i] + a[i]`, and if `0 + x < n`, then `ans1` is further decreased by `2 * a[0 + x]`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 4, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increments `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` was previously 3, it is now 4 (since `i` is incremented by 1). The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
