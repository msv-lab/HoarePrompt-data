Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, `i` is 3, `ans1` is increased by `a[0]` and then increased by `a[3]` if `3 + x` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans1` remains increased by `a[0]` and then increased by `a[2]`, `ans1` is increased by `a[3]`**

Explanation: The code `ans1 += a[i]` increases `ans1` by the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans1` is increased by `a[3]`. The other variables (`k`, `ans`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
