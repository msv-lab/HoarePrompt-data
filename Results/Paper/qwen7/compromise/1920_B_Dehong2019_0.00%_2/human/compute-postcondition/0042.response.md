Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `i`, `x` must be a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the `i`-th element of `a`, `ans` will be the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1 -= a[i] * 2` subtracts twice the value of the `i`-th element of the list `a` from `ans1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans1` is updated to be the original `ans1` minus twice the value of `a[i]`.
