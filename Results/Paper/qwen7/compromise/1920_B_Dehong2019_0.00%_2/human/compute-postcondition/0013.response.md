Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the value of each element from index 0 to index `x-1` in `a`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans1` will be the original sum of all elements in `a` minus twice the value of each element from the start of the list up to but not including the `x`-th element.
