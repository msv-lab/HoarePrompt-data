Output State: **`empty` is True, `t` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `edges` is an empty list, `leaves` is a deque containing the leaf nodes of the tree, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and `moves` is a boolean value indicating whether Ron can make a move.**

The code sets the variable `empty` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
