Output State: **`i` is 4, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 4], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (0 - 1)), -1, (1 << 0), ... , -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)], `c` is 16, `k0` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is right-shifted by 1.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`. This means that the value of `k` is divided by 2 (integer division). Since the initial value of `k` is 1, after the operation, `k` becomes 0. However, the condition `if k & 1 == 1` is not met because 0 is not odd. Therefore, the value of `i` remains 4 and `arr` does not change. All other variables remain unchanged as well.
