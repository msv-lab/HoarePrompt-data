Output State: **`i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2], `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value [1], `k` is `k >> 1`**.

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` shifts the bits of `k` to the right by one position, effectively dividing `k` by 2. Since the initial condition states that `k` must be non-zero and if `k` is odd, the values of these variables remain unchanged, the value of `k` is updated to `k >> 1`. All other variables (`i`, `arr`, `c`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
