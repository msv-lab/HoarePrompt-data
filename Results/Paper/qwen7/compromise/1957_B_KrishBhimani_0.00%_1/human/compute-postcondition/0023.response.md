Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an even number, and `arr` is a list containing the values 0 and 1. If `k` is odd, `k` is updated to `k // 2`.**
