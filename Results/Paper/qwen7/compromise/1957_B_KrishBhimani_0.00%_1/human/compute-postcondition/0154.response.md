Output State: **`c` is `n`, `i` is `0`, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]`, `ans` is a list containing the value `-k0`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. However, the value of `k0` is not defined in the given code snippet, and there is no initial value provided for `ans`. Since `ans` is being appended to, it implies that `ans` is a list, but without an initial value for `k0`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value that would be appended. Given the lack of context, we can only say that `ans` will contain the value `-k0`. The other variables (`c`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
