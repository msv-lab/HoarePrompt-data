Output State: **`i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2], `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value [1], `k` is `k >> 1`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 2, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 3. The values of `arr`, `c`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
