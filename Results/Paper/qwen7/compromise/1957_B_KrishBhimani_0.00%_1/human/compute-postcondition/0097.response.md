Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in arr`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is 1
   - `i` is 32
   - `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`
   - `ans` is a list containing the values `[-32, 4294967296]`

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is an element of the list `arr`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 32, which is the 6th element of the list `arr`.

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - The next value of `i` would be the 7th element of the list `arr`, which is 64.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 64.
   - `arr` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `c` remains 1.
   - `i` is now 64.
   - `arr` remains `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`.
   - `ans` remains `[-32, 4294967296]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `c` is 1, `i` is 64, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[-32, 4294967296]`**
