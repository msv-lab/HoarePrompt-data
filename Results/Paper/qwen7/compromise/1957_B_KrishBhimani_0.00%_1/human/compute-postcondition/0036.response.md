The code appends `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Here, `1 << i` is a bitwise left shift operation, which shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `i` positions, effectively multiplying 1 by 2 raised to the power of `i`. Given that `i` is one of the values in the list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`, the value of `1 << i` will range from 1 (when `i` is 0) to 32768 (when `i` is 15).

Since `ans` is initially a list containing the value `-sum(ans)`, and the sum of an empty list is 0, `ans` starts as `[0]`. After appending `1 << i`, `ans` will become `[0, 1 << i]`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `i` remains one of the values in the list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`.
- `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `l1` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
- `n` remains an integer converted from the first element of `l1`.
- `k` remains 0.
- `arr` remains a list containing the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
- `ans` now contains `[0, 1 << i]`.
- `c` remains 1.

Output State: **`i` is one of the values in the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string; `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`; `k` is 0; `arr` is a list containing the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15; `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1 << i]; `c` is 1.**
