Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in arr:`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is one of the values in the list `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the values `[0, 1 << i]`.
   - `c` is 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the list `arr`. Since `arr` contains all the values from 0 to 15, `i` will always be valid until it reaches the end of the list.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is one of the values in the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]` (since `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value).
- `t` remains the same.
- `l1` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `k` remains the same.
- `arr` remains the same.
- `ans` is updated to `[0, 1 << (i-1)]` because `i` was incremented by 1.
- `c` remains the same.

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i` and `ans`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is one of the values in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1 << (i-1)], `c` is 1**.
