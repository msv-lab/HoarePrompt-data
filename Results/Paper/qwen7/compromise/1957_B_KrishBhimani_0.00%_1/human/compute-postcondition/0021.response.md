Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` must be greater than 0 and now equal to `k // 2`, and `arr` is a list containing the values 0 and 1 with an additional element `i` (which is 2).**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` now contains the values 0, 1, and 2.
