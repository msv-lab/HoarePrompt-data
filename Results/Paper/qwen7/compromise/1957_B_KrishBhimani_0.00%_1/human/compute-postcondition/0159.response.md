Output State: **`c` is `n`, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the values `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]`, and `ans` is a list containing the value `[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `1 << i` (which is `1` since `i` is `0`) to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 after this operation. The other variables remain unchanged.
