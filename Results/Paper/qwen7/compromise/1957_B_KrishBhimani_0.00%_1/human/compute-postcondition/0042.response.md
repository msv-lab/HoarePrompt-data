Output State: **`i` is one of the values in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 0, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << i)], `c` is 2, and either `c` is not equal to `n - 1` or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code appends \(1\) left-shifted by `i` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is one of the values in the list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], the value appended to `ans` will be \(2^i\). The initial `ans` was [0, 1, -1], so now it becomes [0, 1, -1, \(2^i\)]. All other variables remain unchanged.
