Postcondition: `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2], `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value [1], `k` must be non-zero. This is because if `k & 1 == 1` (i.e., `k` is odd), the list `arr` is updated to include the value 2, and `k` remains non-zero. There is no change in `i`, `c`, and `ans` if the condition is not met, as there is no else part provided.
