Output State: **`i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1], `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value [1], and `k` must be non-zero**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the value [0]. After appending, `arr` becomes [0, 1]. The values of `i`, `c`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged.
