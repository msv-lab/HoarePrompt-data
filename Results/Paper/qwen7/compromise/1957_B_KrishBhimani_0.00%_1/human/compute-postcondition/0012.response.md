Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is now equal to `k0 // 2`, and `arr` is a list containing the value 0.**

Explanation: The code `k = k >> 1` performs a bitwise right shift operation on `k`, which is equivalent to dividing `k` by 2 and taking the integer part. Since `k` is an odd number, shifting it right by 1 bit effectively divides it by 2, resulting in `k` becoming `k0 // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
