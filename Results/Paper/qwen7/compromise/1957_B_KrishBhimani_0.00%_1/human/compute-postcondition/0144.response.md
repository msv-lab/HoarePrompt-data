Output State: **`i` is one of the elements in `arr`, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], `c` is equal to `n - 1` + 1, `ans` is a list with the element `k0 - sum(ans)` appended to it, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1. Since `c` was previously equal to `n - 1`, now `c` is equal to `n`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
