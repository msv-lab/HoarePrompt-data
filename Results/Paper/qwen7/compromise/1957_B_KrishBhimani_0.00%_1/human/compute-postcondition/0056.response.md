Output State: **`i` is one of the values in the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing the values [0, 1, -1, (1 << (i - 1)), -1, (1 << i), ... , -1, (1 << 14), -1, (1 << 15)], `c` is 16.**

Explanation: The line `arr = []` initializes `arr` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
