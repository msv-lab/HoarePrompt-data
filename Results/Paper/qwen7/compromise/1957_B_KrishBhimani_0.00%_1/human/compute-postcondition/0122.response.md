The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the value [0], `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value [1], and `k` is the current value of `k` divided by 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `k` must be non-zero.

State: **`i` is 1, `arr` is a list containing the value [0], `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the value [1], and `k` must be non-zero**
