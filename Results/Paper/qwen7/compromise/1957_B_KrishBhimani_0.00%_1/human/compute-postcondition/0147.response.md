Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is a list containing the values [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31], `ans` is a list containing the value `k0 - sum(ans)`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. However, the initial values of `k0` and `ans` are not provided. Since `ans` is initially an empty list, `sum(ans)` is 0. Thus, the first element appended to `ans` will be `k0 - 0`, which is simply `k0`. The other variables (`i` and `arr`) remain unchanged.
