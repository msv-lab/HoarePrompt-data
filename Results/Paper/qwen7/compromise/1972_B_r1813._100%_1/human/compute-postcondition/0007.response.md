Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three variables: t (a positive integer between 1 and 100), n (a positive integer between 1 and 100), and s (a string of length n containing only "U" and "D"). For each test case defined by t, it returns the count of "U" characters in the string s if all conditions are met.**
