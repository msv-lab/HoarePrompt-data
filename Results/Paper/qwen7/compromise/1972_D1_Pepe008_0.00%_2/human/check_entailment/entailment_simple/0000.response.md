Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`.

2. **Loop Structure**: The outer loop iterates `T` times, corresponding to each test case. For each test case, it calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

3. **Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The program uses a nested loop where `i` ranges from 1 to `b`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

4. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is used to calculate `x`.
   - This formula seems to be derived from the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - However, the formula does not directly use `gcd(a, b)`, which is a critical part of the problem statement.

5. **GCD Consideration**:
   - The problem requires checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The given formula does not explicitly check this condition.
   - Instead, it appears to be a heuristic or approximation that might not cover all valid pairs.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases like when `a` or `b` is 1, which could simplify the problem significantly.
   - It also does not handle cases where `gcd(a, b)` is not 1, which is crucial for the problem.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as stated. It uses a heuristic approach that may not cover all valid pairs `(a, b)` satisfying the given conditions.

Correctness: **False**
