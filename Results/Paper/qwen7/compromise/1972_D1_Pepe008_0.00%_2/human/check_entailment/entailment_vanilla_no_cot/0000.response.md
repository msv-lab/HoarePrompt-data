Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Inner Loop Range**: The inner loop should iterate over `b` instead of hardcoding `4`. The condition `for j in range(4, b+1):` is incorrect and should be `for j in range(1, b+1):`.

2. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition inside the inner loop should check if `(i + j)` is divisible by `j * gcd(i, j)`, not `(j + i) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0`.

3. **Formula Used in the Sum Calculation**: The formula used in the calculation of `x` is incorrect. It seems like an attempt to simplify the problem but does not correctly count the valid pairs.

4. **Redundant Commented Code**: There is commented code that was likely intended to be used but was not properly integrated into the final solution.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            for j in range(1, a + 1):
                if (i + j) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs `(i, j)` within the given ranges and checks if they satisfy the condition, which is more straightforward and correct for this problem.
