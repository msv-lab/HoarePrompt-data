Postcondition: `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a + 3`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is \((a - (a + 3) \cdot (a + 2)) // (a + 3) + 1\), and `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`. If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), then the condition holds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged as there is no else part.
