Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `b` is an integer at least 3.
   - `i` is `a`.
   - `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`.
   - `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`.
   - `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`.
   - `b` must be at least 1.
   - `x` is \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i\).
   - If \(a - i \times (i - 1) > 0\), then `suma` is incremented by `x`; otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `a` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `a + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `b`. Therefore, `a + 1` must be less than or equal to `b`.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `i` will be `a + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- `b` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a + 1`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is \((a - (a + 1) \times (a + 1 - 1)) // (a + 1)\), and if \(a - (a + 1) \times (a + 1 - 1) > 0\), then `suma` is incremented by `x`; otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.**

Simplifying the expression for `x`:
\[ x = \frac{a - (a + 1) \times a}{a + 1} = \frac{a - a^2 - a}{a + 1} = \frac{-a^2}{a + 1} \]

Since \(\frac{-a^2}{a + 1}\) is always negative for positive integers \(a\), it implies that \(x\) will always be 0 because the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive.

So, the final simplified state is:

State: **`info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `b` is an integer at least 3, `i` is `a + 1`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, and `x` is 0.**
