Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `suma` is `suma` plus `x`, and `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Given the initial conditions, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, and `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0. After executing the code, `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its current value, while the values of `b` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
