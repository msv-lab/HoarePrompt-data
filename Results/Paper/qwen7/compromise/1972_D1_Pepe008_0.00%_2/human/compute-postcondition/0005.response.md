Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `suma` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `suma` to 0. The other variables (`T`, `t`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The print statement in the code block is not executed because no further code follows the initialization of `suma`. Therefore, the only change is that `suma` is now set to 0.
