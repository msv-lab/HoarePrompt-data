Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` must be greater than 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the `info` list to `a` and the second element of the `info` list to `b`, both converted to integers. The values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged, and `a` and `b` are updated to their new integer values.
