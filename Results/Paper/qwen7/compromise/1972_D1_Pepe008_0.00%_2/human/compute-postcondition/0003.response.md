Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])`**.

This means that the value of `T` remains greater than 0, the value of `t` remains 0, and the values of `a` and `b` are set to the first and second elements of the list `info` converted to integers, respectively.
