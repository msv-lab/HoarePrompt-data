Output State: All variables outside the loop, including `T`, `a`, and `b`, retain their final values from the last iteration. Specifically, `t` equals `T-1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations. `a` and `b` hold the values from the last input `info` provided. The variable `suma` contains the cumulative sum of `x` values calculated over all iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `b`. After the loop completes, `i` would be `b + 1` for the next potential iteration, but since the loop has finished, `i` is no longer tracked individually.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes all its iterations, `T` will be decremented by the number of times the loop ran, `a` and `b` will be the values from the last input, and `suma` will be the total sum of `x` values calculated throughout all iterations.
