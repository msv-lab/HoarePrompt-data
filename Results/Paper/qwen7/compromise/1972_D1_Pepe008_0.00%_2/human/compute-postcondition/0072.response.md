To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is set to `a + b` after the loop completes.
   - `suma` is the sum of `x` for each iteration from 1 to `b`.
   - `x` is calculated as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1\) for each `i` in the range.
   - `a` is the first element of `info`.
   - `b` is the second element of `info`.
   - `b` must be at least 1.
   - `suma` is updated based on the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

2. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - For each `i` in the range from 1 to `b`, `x` is calculated as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1\).
   - `suma` is then updated by adding `x` to it if the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` is satisfied.

3. **Final Values**:
   - Since `i` is `a + b` after the loop, and `suma` is the sum of `x` for each iteration, we need to determine the value of `suma`.
   - The value of `suma` depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and the calculation of `x` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `b`.

4. **Calculation of `x`**:
   - For each `i` in the range from 1 to `b`, `x` is calculated as \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1\).
   - This formula simplifies to \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i * (i - 1)}{i} \right\rfloor + 1\).

5. **Summing `x`**:
   - `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values for each `i` in the range from 1 to `b`.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement is `print(suma - 1)`, so the output will be `suma - 1`.

Given the above steps, the output will be the value of `suma` minus 1.

Output: **suma - 1**
