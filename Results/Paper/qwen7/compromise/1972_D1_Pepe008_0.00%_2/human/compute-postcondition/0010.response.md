Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` is `int(info[1])` and must be at least 1, `suma` is `x`, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1, and (a - i * (i - 1)) is greater than 0**

Explanation: 
- The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`.
- From the initial state, `x` is calculated as `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`, which simplifies to `(a - 0) // 1` or simply `a`.
- Since `(a - i * (i - 1))` is greater than 0 and `i` is 2, we have `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) > 0` or `a - 2 > 0`, which means `a > 2`.
- Therefore, `x` is `a`, and `suma` is updated to be `suma + a`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
