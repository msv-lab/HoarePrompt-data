Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is the last element in `arr`.
- `cnt` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`.
- `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
- The condition `flag` is true.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This code snippet directly prints the integer `-1`. The values of `val`, `cnt`, `ans`, and `flag` are not relevant to the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **-1**
