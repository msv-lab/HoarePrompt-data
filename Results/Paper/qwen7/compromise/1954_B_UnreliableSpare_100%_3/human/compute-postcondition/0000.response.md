Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the given array a is beautiful.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `a` is not modified by this code. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the specified range, `n` is now an integer read from the input within the specified range, and `a` remains a list of integers within the specified range and is still beautiful.
