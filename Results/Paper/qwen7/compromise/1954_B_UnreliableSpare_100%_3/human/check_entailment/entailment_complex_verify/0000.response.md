### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically failing to account for arrays where the middle element can be removed to break the beauty condition. Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version to verify this claim.

1. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an input `n` and an array `arr` of length `n`.
   - It first checks if the array is already beautiful by comparing consecutive elements. If any two consecutive elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - If the array is not beautiful (`flag` is `False`), it proceeds to calculate the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in the array.
   - If the array is beautiful (`flag` is `True`), it prints `-1`.

2. **Key Points in the Annotated Code**:
   - The loop that checks for consecutive elements sets `flag` to `False` as soon as it finds a difference between consecutive elements.
   - The subsequent loop calculates the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in the array.
   - The final result is determined based on the value of `ans` and the state of `flag`.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     5
     1 2 1 2 1
     ```
   - The function correctly identifies that the array is not beautiful and calculates the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element.
   - The output is `1`, which is correct because removing the middle element `2` breaks the beauty condition.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the array is already beautiful by printing `-1`.
   - It also handles the case where the array is not beautiful by calculating the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element.

Given the analysis, the function appears to correctly handle the problem statement and the provided examples. The original assessment incorrectly claims that the function fails to account for the middle element scenario, but the provided code actually does handle such cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
