Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for arrays where the middle element can be removed to break the beauty condition. Here is an example to illustrate this:

Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

According to the problem description, the goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The given solution incorrectly outputs `1` because it only checks for consecutive elements and does not consider removing the middle element `2` to break the beauty condition.

A correct approach would involve identifying segments of the array where the beauty condition holds and calculating the minimum removals needed to break these segments. The provided solution does not implement this logic, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
