Reasoning:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Beautiful Array Check**: The `func_1` function checks if the array is already beautiful by comparing adjacent elements. If any pair of adjacent elements are different, the flag is set to `False`, indicating the array is not beautiful.
3. **Minimum Removal Calculation**: If the array is not beautiful, the function calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to ensure no two adjacent elements are equal. This is done by counting consecutive occurrences of the same element and keeping track of the minimum count.
4. **Output**: The program prints `-1` if the array is beautiful and otherwise prints the minimum number of removals needed.

Given the execution summary matches the expected behavior and the code logic aligns with the problem requirements, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
