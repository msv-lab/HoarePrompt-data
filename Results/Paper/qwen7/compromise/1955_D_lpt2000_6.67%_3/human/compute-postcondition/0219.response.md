Postcondition: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. In either case, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, and `out_aa` is either decremented by 1 in `aa[:n - m]` (if the if condition is true) or `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 (if the else condition is true).
