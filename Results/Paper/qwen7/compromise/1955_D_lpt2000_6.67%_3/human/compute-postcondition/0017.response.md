Output State: **`m` is less than the length of `aa`, `n` is greater than `m`, the current value of `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, and the current value of `E[out_aa]` is now `E[out_aa] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `E[out_aa] -= 1` decrements the value of `E[out_aa]` by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
