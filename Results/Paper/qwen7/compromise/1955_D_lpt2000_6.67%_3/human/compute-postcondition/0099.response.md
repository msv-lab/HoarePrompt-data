Output State: **Postcondition: `aa` must have at least `n` elements, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least 1 element. The value of `C[out_aa]` is now `C[out_aa] + 1`, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `C[out_aa] += 1` increments the value of `C[out_aa]` by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
