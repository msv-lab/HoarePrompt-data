Output State: **`E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `fnd` is `fnd` + 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, else `fnd` remains the same; `tot` is the sum of the values in `D`; `aa` must have at least `n` elements; `m` is an integer; `n` is an integer; `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least 1 element; `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `E[out_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `E[out_aa]` by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
