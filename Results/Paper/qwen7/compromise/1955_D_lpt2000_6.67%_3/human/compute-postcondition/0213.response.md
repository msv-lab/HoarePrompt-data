Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`**

Explanation: The code `D[out_aa] -= 1` decrements the value of `D[out_aa]` by 1. The other variables (`fnd`, `in_aa`, and `out_aa`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
