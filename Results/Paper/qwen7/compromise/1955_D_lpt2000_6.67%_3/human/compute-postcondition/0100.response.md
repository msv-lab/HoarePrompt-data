Postcondition: `aa` must have at least `n` elements, `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least 1 element. Additionally, `D[out_aa]` remains greater than 0. If `E[out_aa]` was originally greater than 0 and is now greater than 0 but less than its original value, then `E[out_aa]` remains greater than 0. Otherwise, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0.
