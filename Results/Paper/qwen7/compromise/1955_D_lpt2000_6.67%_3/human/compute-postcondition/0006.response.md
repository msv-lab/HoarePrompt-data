Output State: **`nabors` must be at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `bb` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in `aa` up to index `m-1`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the count of elements in `bb`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt_bb = Counter(bb)` creates a new Counter object `cnt_bb` that contains the count of each element in the list `bb`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
