Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Logic for Finding Minimum Invitations**: The logic in the current implementation only checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints `2`. However, this approach is incomplete because it does not handle cases where no such direct pairs exist but still allows for a solution with fewer than 3 invitations.

2. **Handling Cases with No Direct Pairs**: The program should check for cycles and indirect connections to ensure that at least 2 friends can be invited with the minimum number of invitations. For example, in the second test case, the program should identify that inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 is necessary, which it currently fails to do.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, in the third test case, it incorrectly prints `2` instead of `3`.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be revised to correctly identify cycles and indirect connections among friends. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Track visited nodes to detect cycles
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        min_invitations = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if not visited[i]:
                cycle_size = 0
                start_node = i
                while not visited[start_node]:
                    visited[start_node] = True
                    start_node = l[start_node - 1]
                    cycle_size += 1
                
                # If cycle size is 2, we need 2 invitations
                if cycle_size == 2:
                    min_invitations = 2
                    break
                else:
                    min_invitations = min(min_invitations, cycle_size)
        
        print(min_invitations)

func()
```

This revised program correctly identifies cycles and indirect connections, ensuring that the minimum number of invitations required to have at least 2 friends at the party is calculated accurately.
