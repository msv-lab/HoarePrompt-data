Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0, `p` is the integer at index `i` (which is now the first element of the list `l`).**

In this output state, the variable `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The value of `p` is set to the integer at index `i` in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
