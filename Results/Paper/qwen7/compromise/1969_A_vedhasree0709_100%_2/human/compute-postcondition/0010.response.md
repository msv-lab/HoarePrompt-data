Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `j` is 0.
- `p` is the integer at index `i` (which is now the first element of the list `l`).
- `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` in the list `l`. The current value of `q` is `i + 1`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(2)
```

This statement will directly print the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
