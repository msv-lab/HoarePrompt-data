Postcondition: `i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0, `p` is the integer at index 0 of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`. The current value of `q` is `i + 1`.
