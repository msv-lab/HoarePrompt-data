Postcondition: **`i` is 7, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 5 of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`, and the loop has completed its iterations, meaning `i` has incremented past the last index of the list `l`.**
