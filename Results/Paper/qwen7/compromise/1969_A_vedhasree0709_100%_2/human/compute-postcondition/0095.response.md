Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting a new input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `j` is 1.
- `p` is the integer at index 1 of the list `l`.
- `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.
- `q` is now set to the value of `l[p - 1]`.

The print statement is simply `print(2)`, which means it will print the integer 2.

Output: **2**
