Postcondition: **`i` is `n`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 0, `p` is the integer at index `n-1` of the list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of the list `l`.**

Explanation: Since the condition `j == 0` is true in the if part, the if part's postcondition directly applies. The values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain as described in the if part's postcondition, as there are no changes made outside the if condition. Therefore, the overall postcondition of the if else block is the same as the if part's postcondition.
