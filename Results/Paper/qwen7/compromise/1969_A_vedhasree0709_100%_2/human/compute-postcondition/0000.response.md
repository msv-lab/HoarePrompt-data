Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter.
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder, it doesn't carry any meaningful state that affects the loop execution.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, and `p`.
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the loop will read input from `int(input())`, which should match the value of `t`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute:**
   - The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - Therefore, `t` must be a positive integer within the range [1, 5000].

Given this analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
