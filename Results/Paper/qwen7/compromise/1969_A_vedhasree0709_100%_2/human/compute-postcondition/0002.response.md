Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list `l` by taking input as a string, splitting it into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
