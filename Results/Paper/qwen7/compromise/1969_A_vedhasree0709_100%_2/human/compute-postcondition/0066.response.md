Output State: **`i` is 3, `p` is `l[3]`, `q` is `l[l[3] - 1]`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**.

Explanation: The code `q = l[p - 1]` updates the value of `q` to be the element at index `p - 1` in list `l`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `p` remains as `l[3]`, and the new value of `q` is now `l[l[3] - 1]`.
