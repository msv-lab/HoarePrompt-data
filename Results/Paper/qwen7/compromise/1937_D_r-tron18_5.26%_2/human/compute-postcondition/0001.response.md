Output State: **`pre` is a list of integers where each integer is (i + 1) for every index `i` where `s1[i]` is '>', `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s1`, `t` is the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5 and for each test case 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^5, `totalOne` is the length of the list `pre`.**

Explanation: The line `totalOne = len(pre)` calculates the length of the list `pre` and assigns it to the variable `totalOne`. The values of `pre`, `s1`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.
