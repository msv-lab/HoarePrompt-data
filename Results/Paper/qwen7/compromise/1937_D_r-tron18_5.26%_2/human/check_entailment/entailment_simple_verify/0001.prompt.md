You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided code step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid with `n` cells.
   - Each cell contains either `<` or `>`.
   - A pinball starts at a specific cell and moves according to the direction of the cell it is currently on.
   - The direction of the cell is toggled after each move.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Code Structure:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is not directly relevant to solving the main problem but seems to be part of a larger logic.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the input and calculates the time for each pinball starting position.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the direction is `>` (right).
     - `totalOne` counts the number of `>` directions.
     - `preOne` is a cumulative sum of the positions of `>` directions.
     - `suffZero` is a list to store suffix sums of positions where the direction is `<` (left).
     - `ans` is initialized to store the result for each starting position.

   - **Main Logic:**
     - The loop iterates backward through the string `s1` (from the last cell to the first).
     - For each cell, it checks the direction (`el`).
     - Depending on the direction, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using different formulas.
     - It updates the `preOne` and `suffZero` lists accordingly.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_2` appears to correctly handle the toggling of directions and the calculation of the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The use of cumulative sums and suffix sums helps in efficiently calculating the required values.
   - The backward iteration ensures that the pinball's path is correctly traced.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided code seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions and their logic align with the problem statement and the expected behavior of the pinball.
