Output State: **`favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `removed_count` is equal to the number of times the value at index `i` in `sorted_a` is equal to `favorite_value`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and mapping the input, `n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values of integers split from input, `favorite_value` is equal to `a[f - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[f - 1]` to `favorite_value`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `favorite_value` is now specifically set to the value at index `f - 1` in the list `a`.
