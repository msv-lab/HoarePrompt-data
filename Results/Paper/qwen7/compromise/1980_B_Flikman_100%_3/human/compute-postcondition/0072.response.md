Postcondition: `i` is `k`, `removed_count` is 0, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers obtained by sorting `a` in descending order, and the current value of `sorted_a[i]` is equal to `favorite_value`.
