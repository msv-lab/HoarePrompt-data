Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `removed_count` is either 2 or 3, `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `sorted_a` is a list of integers obtained by sorting `a` in descending order, `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`. If `removed_count` is 0, then `favorite_count` remains the same as the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`. Otherwise, `favorite_count` is less than the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`.
