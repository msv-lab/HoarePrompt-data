Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `removed_count` is either 2 or 3.
- `favorite_count` is the count of `a[f - 1]` in the list `sorted_a`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `f` is an input integer.
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.
- `sorted_a` is a list of integers obtained by sorting `a` in descending order.
- `favorite_value` is `a[f - 1]`.
- `favorite_count` is the count of `favorite_value` in the list `sorted_a`.
- The current value of `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. There are no variables or objects within the `print` statement itself that need further evaluation.

Output: **YES**
