Output State: **`favorite_count` is equal to the number of times `favorite_value` appears in `sorted_a`, `i` is equal to `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `removed_count` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and mapping the input, `n`, `f`, and `k` are assigned the values of integers split from input, `favorite_value` is equal to `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` is a list of integers from `a` sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The line `removed_count = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `removed_count`. This does not affect any other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `removed_count` and retains the unchanged values of the other variables.
