Output State: `cur` is 0, `cnt` must be equal to 3, `ans` now has `n` elements where the last element is `ans[0] - 2` and all other elements remain the same, `counter` is an empty dictionary.

Explanation: After the loop executes all 3 iterations, `cnt` will be 3. The loop body decrements the last element of `ans` in each iteration. Since the loop runs 3 times, the last element of `ans` will be decremented by 3 from its initial value, resulting in `ans[0] - 2`. All other elements in `ans` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
