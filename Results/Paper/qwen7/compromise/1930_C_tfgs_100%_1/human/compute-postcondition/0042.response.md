Output State: **`j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur) - adv`, `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j)`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt -= adv` decreases the value of `cnt` by `adv`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial definitions.
