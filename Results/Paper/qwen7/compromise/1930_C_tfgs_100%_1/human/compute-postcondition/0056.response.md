Output State: **`adv` must be greater than 0, `cnt` and `cur` should be such that they allow `adv` to be greater than 0, `ans` now contains `len(ans) + 1` elements, and the new element is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ans`. The new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. The values of `adv`, `cnt`, `cur`, and the length of `ans` before the append operation remain unchanged. The length of `ans` increases by one, and the last element of `ans` is now `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
