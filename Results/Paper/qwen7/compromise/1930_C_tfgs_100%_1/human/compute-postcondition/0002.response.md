Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the loop head but will be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Therefore, the loop will execute if and only if `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is set to 0 at the start of the loop, the condition `i < n` will be true as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 to guarantee that the loop can execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`. Specifically, `i` should be 0 and `n` should be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces**
