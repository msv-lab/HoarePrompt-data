Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `cnt` is equal to 3.
   - `ans` is a list with `n` elements, where the last element is `ans[0] - 2` and all other elements remain the same.
   - `counter` is an empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs 3 times because `cnt` is 3.
   - In each iteration, the last element of `ans` is decremented by 1.
   - After 3 iterations, the last element of `ans` will be `ans[0] - 2`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop, the last element of `ans` will be `ans[0] - 2`.
   - All other elements in `ans` remain unchanged.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

Given this, let's determine the exact output:

- Let's denote the initial value of `ans[0]` as `x`.
- The last element of `ans` after 3 iterations will be `x - 2`.
- All other elements in `ans` remain unchanged.

So, if `ans` initially was `[x, y1, y2, ..., yn-1, x]`, after the loop it will be `[x, y1, y2, ..., yn-1, x - 2]`.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of `ans` printed in a space-separated format.

Output: **x y1 y2 ... yn-1 x-2**
