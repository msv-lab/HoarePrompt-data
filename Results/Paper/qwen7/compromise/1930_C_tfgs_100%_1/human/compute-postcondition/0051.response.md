Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for j in range(adv):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `adv`.

2. **Determine Initial Values for `j` and `adv`:**
   - `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `adv`.
   - `adv` is defined as `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   For the loop to execute, `adv` must be greater than 0. If `adv` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `adv` is greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `j` is 0, but we don't need to explicitly state this since it is part of the loop initialization.

### Adjusted States:
- `adv` must be greater than 0.
- `cnt` and `cur` should be such that they allow `adv` to be greater than 0.

Given the initial states:
- `cur` is `cur + counter[a[i]]`
- `cnt` is `cnt - adv`
- `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[adv - 1] - (adv - 1 - j)`
- `a` remains unchanged
- `j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1)`
- `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`
- `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1
- `i` is `i + 1` such that `i + 1 < len(a)`

We need to focus on ensuring `adv` is greater than 0. 

### Final State Adjustment:
State: **`adv` must be greater than 0, `cnt` and `cur` should be such that they allow `adv` to be greater than 0.**

This ensures that the loop can execute based on the given conditions.
