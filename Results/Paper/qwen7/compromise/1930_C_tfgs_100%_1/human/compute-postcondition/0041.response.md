Output State: **`j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j)` for `j` from `0` to `adv - 1`.**

In this final output state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `j` will be `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1)`, which simplifies to `0`. The variable `adv` will still be `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`. The list `ans` will contain `n - 1` elements, with each element calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j)` for `j` ranging from `0` to `adv - 1`. This means `ans` will contain values starting from `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)` down to `a[i - 1] - 0`, depending on the value of `adv`.
