Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), another positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and a list a. It then performs some unspecified operation based on these inputs and returns a result for each test case.
