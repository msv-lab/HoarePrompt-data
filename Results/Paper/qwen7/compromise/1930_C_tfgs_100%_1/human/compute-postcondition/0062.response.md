Output State: **`cur` is `cur + counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `ans` now contains `n` elements, and each element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j) - 1` for `j` in the range of `adv`. If `i > 0`, then `adv` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(a[i])` appends the current value of `a[i]` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` initially contained `n-1` elements, after appending `a[i]`, it now contains `n` elements. The other variables (`cur`, `cnt`, and `adv`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition for `adv` remains the same: if `i > 0`, then `adv` is 0.
