Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.
   - `a[i]` (which is `a[0]`) is increased by 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, it will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `a` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop head.

Thus, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces**.
