Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `a[2]` is increased by 3.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression `i + 1` evaluates to 3. Therefore, the value of `a[2]` is increased by 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
