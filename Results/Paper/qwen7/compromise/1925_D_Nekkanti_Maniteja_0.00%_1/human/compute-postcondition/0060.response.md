Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `100000 + m`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The initial values of `total` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is still greater than 0, but its specific value is not known since no specific value was provided in the input. Therefore, `i` is still `100000 + m`.
