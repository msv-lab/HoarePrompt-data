Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < m`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 100001
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000
   - `u` is an integer from input
   - `v` is an integer from input
   - `f` is an integer from input
   - `a` is `a` plus `f`

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 100001, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 100002.
   - The value of `m` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, as the loop condition depends on `m` and not on the changes within the loop.

5. **States of Other Variables**: The other variables (`u`, `v`, `f`, and `a`) are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition. Therefore, they remain unchanged.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` must be 100002
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000 (unchanged)
- `u` remains an integer from input
- `v` remains an integer from input
- `f` remains an integer from input
- `a` remains `a` plus `f`

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 100002, `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `a` is `a` plus `f`**
