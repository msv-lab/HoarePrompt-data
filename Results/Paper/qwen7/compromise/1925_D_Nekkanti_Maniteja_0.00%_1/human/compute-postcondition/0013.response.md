Output State: **`i` is 2, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is `a` + `f`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged, and `a` is updated to `a + f`. Since the exact values of `u` and `v` are not specified, they are left as input integers. The condition for `m` remains the same.
