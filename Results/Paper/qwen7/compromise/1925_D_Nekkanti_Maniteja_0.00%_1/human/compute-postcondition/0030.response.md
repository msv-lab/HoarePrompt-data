Output State: **`i` is 100000, `k` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 100000, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M` and assigns it to `c`. Since `n` is an input integer, the exact value of `c` depends on the value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
