Output State: `total` is 0, `i` is `100000 + m + m`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is the sum of `f` for each iteration from 1 to `m`.

Explanation: The loop runs `m` times, and in each iteration, the value of `f` is added to `a`. After all iterations, `i` will be `100000 + m + m` because it starts at `100000 + m` and increments by 1 for each iteration. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with each input during the loop, but their final values after the loop will be the last set of inputs provided. The variable `a` accumulates the sum of `f` values over all iterations.
