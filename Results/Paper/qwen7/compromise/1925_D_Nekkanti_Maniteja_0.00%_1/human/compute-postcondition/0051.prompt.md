Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is 100000 + `m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `a` is the sum of `a` plus `f` for each iteration of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to the initial value of 100000 plus the value of `m`. The variable `m` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 100000. The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` represent the integers obtained from the input split operation during each iteration. The variable `a` will hold the cumulative sum of all `f` values provided as input over the course of the loop's execution.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is `c * i * c * m + c * a`, `i` is `100000 + m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `k` must be at least 1, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `a` is the sum of `a` plus `f` for each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is `2 * c * i * c * m + 2 * c * a`, `i` is `100001 + m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `k` must be at least 1, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `a` is the sum of `a` plus `f` for each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is `4 * c * i * c * m + 3 * c * a`, `i` is `100002 + m`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `k` must be at least 1, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `a` is the sum of `a` plus `f` for each iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
