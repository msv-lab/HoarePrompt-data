Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(k)`. This means the variable `i` is being iterated over a range starting from 0 up to `k-1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 100000.
   - `s` is `s` + `c` * `i` * `c` * `m` + `c` * `a`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(k)`, the value of `i` should be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `100000 + 1 = 100001`.
   - The expression for `s` remains the same but with the updated value of `i`.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The state of `i` changes to 100001.
   - The state of `s` remains as `s` + `c` * `100000` * `c` * `m` + `c` * `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 100001, `s` is `s` + `c` * `100000` * `c` * `m` + `c` * `a`**.
