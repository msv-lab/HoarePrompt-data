Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The function `int(input())` reads an integer from the input and sets the value of `i` to this integer. Since `t` (the integer read from input) is the number of test cases, `i` will start from 0 and go up to `t-1`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `t`. Initially, `i` is 0, and `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 and `t` is within the specified range.

**State:**
- `i` is 0
- `t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\)

Thus, the final state needed to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\)**
