Output State: **`i` is 100002, `m` must be greater than or equal to 100000, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `a` is `a` plus `f`.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The initial value of `a` is not specified, so it remains unchanged as "a plus f". The other variables (`i`, `m`) are not affected by this operation.
