Output State: `i` is `100000 + 2 * m`, `k` is `m`, `s` is `m * c * i * c * m + m * c * a`.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `100000 + 2 * m` because the loop increments `i` starting from `100000 + m` and runs for `m` iterations. The variable `k` will be `m` since it represents the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is equal to `m`. The variable `s` will be set to the cumulative sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each iteration, where `i` is `100000 + 2 * m` and `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the course of the loop's execution.
