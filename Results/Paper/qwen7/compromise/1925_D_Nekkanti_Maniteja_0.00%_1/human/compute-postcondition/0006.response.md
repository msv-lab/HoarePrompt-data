Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `m` (which is used in the `range(m)` function).

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute if `m` is at least 1. This is because `range(m)` will generate numbers from 0 to `m-1`.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop depends on `m`, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than or equal to 1. The other variables (`t`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m` being greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1**
