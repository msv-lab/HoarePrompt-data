Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a[0]` is greater than the current value of `a[1]`.
- `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether `new[i-1]` is less than or equal to `new[i]` for all `i` in the range 1 to the length of `new`.
- The condition `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both true.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement will simply output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
