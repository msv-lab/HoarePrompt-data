Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 are less than or equal to the next element, and it is given that `check_all` is `True`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
