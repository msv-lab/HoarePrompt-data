Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `new` starts from `a[2]` and onwards, `check_all_new` is determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, `new_all` is True because the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])` is met, in either case, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**
