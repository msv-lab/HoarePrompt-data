Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 3.
- `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the original sequence.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to their corresponding index.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` satisfy the condition `(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'` without any dependency on the values of `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`.

Output: **YES**
