Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `a[0]` is greater than the current value of `a[1]`; `new` is a list starting from `a[2]` to the end of the list `a`; `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any of the variables' values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such context is provided, the variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the program would exit the current loop or conditional block.
