Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` which is `a[1]` and onwards, `check_all_new` is True as all elements in `new` satisfy the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, `new_all` is True as all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and the condition `(check_all_new and new_all)` is satisfied.**
