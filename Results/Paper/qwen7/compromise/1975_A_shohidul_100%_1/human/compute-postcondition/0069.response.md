Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a[0]` is either greater than or equal to `a[1]`. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, or if `new_all` is false (indicating that `new[i-1]` is greater than `new[i]` for at least one `i` in the range 1 to the length of `new`), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
