Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 are less than or equal to the next element, and the program prints 'YES' if there exists a pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 such that the first element is greater than the second element, and prints 'NO' otherwise.**
