Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 3, `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the original sequence, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to their corresponding index, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` satisfy the condition `(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))`, and in either case (whether `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true or not), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
