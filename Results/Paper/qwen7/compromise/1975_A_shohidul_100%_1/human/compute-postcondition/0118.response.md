Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` which is `a[1]` and onwards
   - `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`
   - `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`
   - Either both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are True, or at least one of them is False, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n`, and currently `i` is 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is an input integer and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` which is `a[1]` and onwards, `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])**
