Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 999.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the input split by spaces.
- `check_all` is initially set to `True` if all elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-2` are less than or equal to the next element, otherwise it is set to `False`.

However, regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `check_all`, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
