### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified the steps and logic of the program. However, there are a few points that need further clarification and verification:

1. **Initial Check for Non-Decreasing Order:**
   - The program correctly checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order using `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

2. **Handling Non-Native Non-Decreasing Arrays:**
   - The program iterates through possible splits of the array, starting from index 1.
   - For each split at index `i`, it checks if the suffix (from index `i` to the end) can be placed before the prefix (from index 0 to `i-1`) such that the entire array becomes non-decreasing.
     - It checks if the first element of the prefix (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix (`new[0]`).
     - It checks if the suffix itself is in non-decreasing order (`new_all`).

3. **Output:**
   - If a valid split is found, the program prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no valid split is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO'.

### Verification Against Test Cases

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - This array cannot be made non-decreasing by any split, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'NO'.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - The array can be split at index 2 to get `[2, 2, 3]` and `[7, 9]`, and then rearranged to `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is non-decreasing.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'YES'.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - The array is already in non-decreasing order, so the output should be 'YES'.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'YES'.

### Additional Verification

To ensure the program handles edge cases and all possible scenarios correctly, let's consider additional test cases:

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - The array can be split at index 1 to get `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[5]`, and then rearranged to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is non-decreasing.
   - The program should output 'YES'.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`
   - The array cannot be made non-decreasing by any split, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - The program should output 'NO'.

### Final Evaluation

After re-evaluating the program with additional test cases and confirming the logic, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly.

**Final: True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.
