Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all`. If it is, it prints 'YES'.
4. If the array is not sorted, it iterates through the array to find a segment that, when swapped, can make the entire array non-decreasing.
5. For each potential split point `i`, it checks if the suffix starting at `i` can be placed before the prefix up to `i` such that the resulting array is non-decreasing.
6. The logic for checking if a segment can be swapped to form a non-decreasing array is correct. Specifically, it checks if the first element of the prefix is greater than or equal to all elements of the suffix (`check_all_new`) and if the suffix itself is non-decreasing (`new_all`).
7. The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

Given this analysis, the program logic matches the problem description and correctly determines if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping segments.

Correctness: **True**
