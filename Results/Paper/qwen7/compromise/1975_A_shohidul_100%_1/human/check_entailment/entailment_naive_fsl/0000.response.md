Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array can be split and rearranged to form a non-decreasing sequence correctly. Specifically, the program checks if the entire array is already non-decreasing, which is not sufficient. It also attempts to check if the subarray after the split can be rearranged to fit the condition, but the logic is flawed.

For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 2, 4]`. According to the problem description, we can split this array into `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]`, and then swap them to get `[2, 4, 1, 3]`, which is not sorted. However, the program would incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to the last element of the subarray after the split, which is not a valid condition for sorting the array.

A correct approach would involve checking if the array can be split and rearranged such that the resulting array is non-decreasing. This requires more complex logic to verify the conditions under which the array can be split and rearranged.
