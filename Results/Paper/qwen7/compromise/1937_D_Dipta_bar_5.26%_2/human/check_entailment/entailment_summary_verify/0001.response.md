### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball's movement depends on the direction (`<` or `>`) at each cell, and the direction changes after each move.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is defined to process the string `s`.

3. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - It calculates two arrays `A` and `B` which store the cumulative distances traveled by the pinball when it moves right and left respectively.
   - `A` array is built by iterating from left to right, and `B` array is built by iterating from right to left.
   - The logic for building these arrays seems to be correct as it accounts for the changing directions and the cumulative distances.
   - The main loop in `func_1(s)` then uses these arrays to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.

4. **Main Loop Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates through each cell and uses the precomputed arrays `A` and `B` to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - However, there are several issues with the main loop logic:
     - The logic for computing the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is overly complex and does not accurately reflect the simple movement rules described in the problem statement.
     - The use of cumulative sums and complex arithmetic operations does not align with the straightforward nature of the pinball's movement.
     - The code incorrectly handles the changing directions and the cumulative distances, leading to incorrect results.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundaries of the grid.
   - However, the main logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed, leading to incorrect results for non-boundary cases.

6. **Output**:
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case and for each starting cell, but the values printed are incorrect due to the flawed logic.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is fundamentally incorrect. The code does not correctly implement the movement rules and the direction changes, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
