Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed during the execution of the loop, each calculated based on the conditions within the loop and the current state of the variables `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, `s`, `n`, `l`, and `r`. These numbers are derived from the cumulative sums of positions of '>' characters (`A`), the indices of '>' and '<' characters (`idx_A` and `idx_B`), and the string `s` with its length `n`. The specific calculations involve adjusting these values based on the positions of the characters and the current indices `l` and `r`.

Each number printed corresponds to a specific formula applied to the current state of the variables at each iteration of the loop, reflecting the logic within the conditional statements. The final output state is the sequence of these numbers as they are printed during the loop's execution.
