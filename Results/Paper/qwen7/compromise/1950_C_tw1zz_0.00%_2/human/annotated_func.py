#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM". The specific times printed depend on the input provided during the loop's execution. For each input "hh:mm", the code converts "hh" to 12-hour format and appends "AM" or "PM" accordingly. The minutes "m" remain unchanged, and the output includes both "AM" and "PM" times based on the original "hh" value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of times in the 24-hour format and converts them to the 12-hour format, appending "AM" or "PM" accordingly. It prints each converted time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM". The function takes no parameters and does not return any value.
