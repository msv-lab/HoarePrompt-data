Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads two integers \(x\) and \(n\). It then finds the maximum value between any divisor \(i\) of \(x\) and its corresponding co-divisor \(\frac{x}{i}\), under the condition that \(n \leq i\) or \(n \leq \frac{x}{i}\). Finally, it prints this maximum value for each test case.**
