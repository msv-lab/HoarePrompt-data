Output State: **`v` is `v_prev - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 1]`, and `best` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Since `v` is updated to `v_prev - 1` before this line, `v` remains `v_prev - 1`. The condition for updating `best` is not met because the code only updates `total` and does not change the value of `best` unless the condition `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is true, which is not applicable here. Therefore, `best` retains its original value.
