Output State: **`total` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente - 2`, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `c` is incremented by 1, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains the same, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The line `best = sys.float_info.max` initializes the variable `best` to the maximum floating-point value, which is used later to find the minimum cumulative cost. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `total`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `c`, `cases`, and `custo_pra_passar_b` remain unchanged.
