Postcondition: `total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1`, where `v` is the original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to -1, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1. If `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to either `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` or `best`, and `v` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `total` is updated to the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 1]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v - 1]` for the current value of `v - 1`, and `v` is decremented by 1.
