Output State: **`total` is 0 plus `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]`, `na_frente` is the original value minus 2, `v` is `na_frente - 2`, `v` is decremented by 1, `best` remains unchanged, and `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

Explanation:
- `total` is incremented by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, where `v` is now `na_frente - 2 - 1` (or `na_frente - 3`).
- `na_frente` is updated to be its original value minus 2.
- `v` is set to `na_frente - 2` and then decremented by 1.
- `best` remains unchanged.
- The condition that `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final` is still valid.
