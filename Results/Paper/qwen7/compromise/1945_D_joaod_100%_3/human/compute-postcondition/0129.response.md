Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `c`, which ranges from `0` to `cases-1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: Although the loop body is omitted, we know that the loop iterates over `cases` times. Each iteration updates the values of `v`, `pos_final`, `total`, and `best`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `v` will be `-1` after all iterations.
   - `pos_final` will be an integer.
   - `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs for each iteration.
   - `best` will hold the maximum value between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev]` when `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `c` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, the next iteration will start with `c = 0`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `v` is `-1`, so the next iteration will start with `v` being updated based on the logic inside the loop.
   - `pos_final`, `total`, and `best` will be updated according to the loop body.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `c` will be `0` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `v` will be updated based on the logic inside the loop, but since the exact logic is not provided, we can't specify the exact value of `v` without it. However, we know that `v` will be within the range defined by `na_frente` to `0` inclusive.
   - `pos_final`, `total`, and `best` will be updated according to the loop body, but their exact values are not specified here.

Given this information, the states that need to be adjusted are those related to the loop head, specifically `c`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`c` is 0, `v` will be updated based on the loop logic, `pos_final` will be an integer, `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs for the first iteration, and `best` will hold the maximum value between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev]` if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`**.

Since we cannot specify the exact values of `v`, `pos_final`, `total`, and `best` without the loop body, the most accurate answer focuses on the loop variable `c`.
