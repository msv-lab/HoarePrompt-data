Postcondition: `best` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1`. If `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, then `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. Here, `na_frente` is the original value - 2 and is greater than or equal to -1, `v` is decremented by 1, and `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
