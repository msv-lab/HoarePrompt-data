Based on the initial state provided:

- `v` will be -1 after all iterations of the loop.
- `pos_final` will be an integer.
- `total` will be the sum of the minimum costs (either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) for each iteration where `v` is within the range defined by `na_frente` to 0, inclusive.
- `best` will hold the maximum value between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev]` whenever `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the `print(best)` statement:

1. **Value of `v`:** After the loop, `v` is -1.
2. **Value of `pos_final`:** This is an integer, but its specific value is not provided.
3. **Value of `total`:** This is the sum of the minimum costs for each iteration where `v` ranges from `na_frente` to 0. Since `v` starts from `na_frente` and goes down to 0, `total` accumulates the minimum cost for each step.
4. **Value of `best`:** This is the maximum value between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev]` whenever `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`. Since `v` is -1, it will be compared with `v_prev` (which would be 0 if `v` starts from 0).

Since `v` is -1, the comparison will involve `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`. The `best` value will be the maximum of these two values.

Therefore, the `print(best)` statement will print the maximum value between `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]`.

Output: **max(total + custo_pra_trocar_a[-1], total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0])**
