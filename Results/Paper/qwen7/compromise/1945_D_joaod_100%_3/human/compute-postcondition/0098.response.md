Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `v`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs from `na_frente` to `-1` in reverse order. The loop will continue as long as `v` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

3. **Determine the New Value of `v`:**
   Since the loop runs in reverse, each iteration decreases `v` by 1. Therefore, if `v` was previously some value `v_prev`, at the start of the next iteration, `v` will be `v_prev - 1`.

4. **Adjust the Other States:**
   - `total` will be adjusted based on the condition inside the loop body.
   - `pos_final` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.

5. **Postcondition Analysis:**
   The postcondition states that `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is less. This means that `total` will change at each iteration, but the exact value depends on the comparison inside the loop.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `v` will be decreased by 1 from its previous value.
- `total` will be adjusted based on the comparison inside the loop body.
- `pos_final` remains unchanged.

Since we don't know the exact value of `v` at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote it as `v_prev`. The new value of `v` will be `v_prev - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`v` is `v_prev - 1`, `pos_final` is an integer, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 1]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 1]` depending on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 1]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 1]`**.
