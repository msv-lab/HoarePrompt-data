Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is an input integer that can take values from `na_frente` down to 0, `c` is 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `total` is 0, `best` is now equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and the current value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

This output state reflects that the value of `best` has been updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
