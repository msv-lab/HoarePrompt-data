Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `na_frente` is the original value minus 2, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The variable `pos_final` is decremented by 1. Initially, `pos_final` was an input integer. After the operation, `pos_final` becomes the original input integer minus 1. The other variables (`cases`, `na_frente`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, and `custo_pra_passar_b`) remain unchanged.
