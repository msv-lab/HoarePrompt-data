Postcondition: `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is an integer ranging from `na_frente` down to 2 (or -1 if `v` was already -1), `c` is 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `total` is updated by adding either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value depending on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, and `best` is updated to the maximum of `best` and `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v` is within the range specified by `na_frente` and `pos_final`.
