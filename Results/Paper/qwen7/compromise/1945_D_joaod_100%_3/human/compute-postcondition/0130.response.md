Output State: **`c` is 0, `v` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `na_frente` and `pos_final` respectively. The values of `c` and the initial state of `v` remain unchanged, and the other variables (`total`, `best`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `v_prev`) are not initialized or affected by this code. Therefore, `c` remains 0, `v` becomes an input integer, and `pos_final` becomes an input integer.
