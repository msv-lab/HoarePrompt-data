Output State: **`total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1` (where `v` is decremented by 1), where `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` adds the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to the current value of `total`. The precondition remains unchanged except for the updated value of `total`.
