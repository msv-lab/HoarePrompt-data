Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the number of test cases `cases`, and for each test case, it reads the number of people in front of Kirill (`na_frente`), the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`), the costs of switching to path `a` (`custo_pra_trocar_a`), and the costs of passing through path `b` (`custo_pra_passar_b`).

2. **Loop and Cost Calculation**: 
   - The loop iterates backward from `na_frente - 1` to `-1`.
   - It updates the `total` cost based on the minimum cost option at each step.
   - The variable `best` keeps track of the lowest cumulative cost found during the entire process.

3. **Condition Handling**:
   - If the current position `v` is within the allowed final position (`v <= pos_final`), it checks which path (`a` or `b`) has the lower cost and updates `total` accordingly.
   - If the current position `v` is beyond the allowed final position, it directly adds the cost of the cheaper path to `total`.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the minimum cumulative cost for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be consistent with the problem statement and handles the input and calculations as required.

Correctness: **True**
