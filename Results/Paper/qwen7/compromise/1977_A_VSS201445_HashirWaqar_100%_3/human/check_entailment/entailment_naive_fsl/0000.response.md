Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This ensures that the number of moves can be split into an equal number of additions and subtractions, which is necessary to achieve the desired number of cubes. Given the constraints and the logic used, the program works correctly for all potential cases within the specified range.
