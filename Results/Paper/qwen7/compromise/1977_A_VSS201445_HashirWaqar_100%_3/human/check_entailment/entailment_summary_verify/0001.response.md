### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the necessary conditions for determining whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Let's break down the conditions and verify the program's logic:

1. **Condition 1:** `n >= m`
   - This ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the desired number of cubes `m`. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and to reach `m` cubes, we need at least `m` moves.

2. **Condition 2:** `(n - m) % 2 == 0`
   - This ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. As each move changes the number of cubes by +1 or -1, the total difference must be even to ensure that the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes remains consistent with the initial state (which starts with 0 cubes).

Given these conditions, the program correctly handles all the provided test cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `3 3`
  - `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `3 >= 3` is true.
  - `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` is true.
  - Output: `YES`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `2 4`
  - `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `2 >= 4` is false.
  - Output: `NO`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `5 3`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `5 >= 3` is true.
  - `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` is true.
  - Output: `YES`

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly checks the necessary conditions and produces the expected output.

Final: **True**
