Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
2. The provided solution checks two conditions:
   - \( n \leq k \): If the number of parts \( n \) is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint \( k \), then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer should be 'NO'.
   - \( n - \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil < k \): This condition checks if the difference between the total number of parts \( n \) and the ceiling of \( \frac{n}{m} \) (which represents the maximum number of parts that can be painted with the same color without considering Bob's repainting) is less than \( k \). If this condition is true, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer should be 'NO'.
3. If neither of these conditions is met, the answer should be 'YES', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
4. The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the provided function, which matches the logic explained above.

Based on the reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
