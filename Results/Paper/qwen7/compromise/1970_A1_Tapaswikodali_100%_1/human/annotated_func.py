#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a parentheses sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and the balance of infoB
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a parentheses sequence. The balance of `infoA` is equal to the balance of `infoB`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position attribute of infoB and the position attribute of infoA.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects with attributes `balance` (an integer) and `position` (an integer). Depending on the values of these attributes, the function returns either the difference between the `balance` of `infoA` and `infoB` or the difference between the `position` of `infoB` and `infoA`. Specifically, if the `balance` of `infoA` is not equal to the `balance` of `infoB`, it returns the difference in their balances; otherwise, it returns the difference in their positions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance` is the final balance calculated after processing all characters in `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the balance, index, and character from `s` at that index.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: a string consisting of characters from s ordered by their balance and position
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", calculates the balance of parentheses, sorts the characters based on their balance and original position, and prints a new string formed by these characters in the sorted order. The final state of the program includes the original string `s`, its length `n`, the final balance `balance`, and a printed string `result` which is a concatenation of characters from `s` sorted by their balance and position.
