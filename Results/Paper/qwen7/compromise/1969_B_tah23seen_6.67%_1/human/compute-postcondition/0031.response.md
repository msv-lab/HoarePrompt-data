Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `left < len(s) and s[left] != '1'`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `left` is less than the length of `s` and `s[left]` is not equal to '1'.

2. **Current State**:
   - `s` must have more than 2 elements (`len(s) > 2`).
   - `s[2]` must not be '1'.
   - `left` is increased by 1 after each iteration.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop must be satisfied.
   - Specifically, `left < len(s)` must be true, and `s[left] != '1'` must be true.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `left` is increased by 1 after each iteration, let's denote the current value of `left` as `left_current`.
   - To satisfy `left < len(s)`, `left_current + 1` must be less than `len(s)`, which implies `left_current < len(s) - 1`.
   - To satisfy `s[left] != '1'`, `s[left_current + 1]` must not be '1'.

5. **Final State**:
   - We need to ensure that `left` can be incremented by 1 and still satisfy the loop condition.
   - Therefore, `left` must be less than `len(s) - 1` and `s[left + 1]` must not be '1'.

### Final Answer
State: **`s` must have more than 2 elements, `s[2]` must not be '1', `left` must be less than `len(s) - 1`, and `s[left + 1]` must not be '1'**.
