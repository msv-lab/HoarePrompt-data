Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is each character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing each character of `sChar`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s.append(i)` appends the current character `i` from the string `sChar` to the list `s`. Since `i` takes on the value of each character in `sChar` during each iteration, `s` will contain all the characters of `sChar` after the loop completes. The initial conditions for `sChar` and `i` remain unchanged except that `s` now contains all the characters of `sChar`.
