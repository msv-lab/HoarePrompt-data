Postcondition: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 8, `right` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, and if `s[right]` and `s[left]` are both '0' and '1', respectively, they have swapped their values.
