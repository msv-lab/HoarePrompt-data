Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head conditions**: The loop condition is `right < len(s) and s[right] != '0'`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1.
   - `cost` is 4.
   - `right` is equal to the length of `s` plus 1.
   - `s[right]` must not be '0'.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be true:
     - `right < len(s)`
     - `s[right] != '0'`

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `right` must be less than `len(s)`: Since `right` is currently equal to `len(s) + 1`, we need to decrease `right` by 1 to make `right < len(s)` true.
   - `s[right]` must not be '0': Since `s[right]` must not be '0', we need to ensure that `s[right-1]` (the new value of `s[right]`) is not '0'. However, since `right` is currently out of bounds, we need to bring `right` within bounds first.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - Decrease `right` by 1 to make `right < len(s)`.
   - Ensure that `s[right]` (which is now `s[right-1]`) is not '0'.

Given these adjustments, the final state should be:

State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and `s[right]` must not be '0'**
