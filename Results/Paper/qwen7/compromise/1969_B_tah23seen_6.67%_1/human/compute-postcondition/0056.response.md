Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, `s[right]` and `s[left]` have swapped their values.**

Explanation: The code swaps the characters at positions `left` and `right` in the list `s`. Since `left` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1 and `right` is equal to the length of `s` minus 1, they are the same index. However, because `sChar` ends with '0', `i` (which is the last character in `sChar`) is '0'. After the swap, `s[left]` and `s[right]` will both be '0', but since they are the same index, no actual swap occurs. All other variables remain unchanged.
