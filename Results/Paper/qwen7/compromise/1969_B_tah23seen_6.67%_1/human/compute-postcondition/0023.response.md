Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `right < len(s) and s[right] != '0'`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is 1.
   - `cost` is 2.
   - `right` is 3.
   - `s[1]` must not be '0'.
   - `len(s)` must be at least 2.

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `right` and `s[right]`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be true:
     - `right < len(s)`
     - `s[right] != '0'`

5. **Current Values**:
   - `right` is currently 3.
   - `len(s)` is at least 2 (let's assume it is exactly 2 for simplicity, as it must be at least 2).

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `right` is currently 3, and `len(s)` is at least 2, `right < len(s)` is already satisfied.
   - To satisfy `s[right] != '0'`, we need to ensure that `s[3]` is not '0'. However, since `s` is a list of characters from `sChar` and `sChar` is a binary string, the maximum index for `s` would be `len(sChar) - 1`. Given that `right` is 3, and assuming `sChar` has at least 4 characters (to allow `right` to be 3), `s[3]` should not be '0'.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `right` must be such that `s[right]` is not '0'.

Given the current values, we need to ensure `s[3]` is not '0'. Since `sChar` is a non-empty binary string and `s` contains all characters of `sChar`, `s[3]` should not be '0' for the loop to continue.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is 3, `s[1]` must not be '0', `len(s)` must be at least 2, and `s[3]` must not be '0'**.
