Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and `s[right-1]` is swapped with `s[left]`**.

Explanation: The code `cost += right - left + 1` updates the value of `cost` by adding the expression `right - left + 1` to its current value. Initially, `cost` is 2. Given that `right` is the length of `s` and `left` is `right - 1` (since `s[left]` was swapped with `s[right-1]`), the expression `right - left + 1` evaluates to `right - (right - 1) + 1 = 2`. Thus, `cost` becomes `2 + 2 = 4`. All other variables remain unchanged.
