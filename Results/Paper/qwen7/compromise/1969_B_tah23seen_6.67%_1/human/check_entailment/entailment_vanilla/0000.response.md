Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(s)` to compute the minimum cost.
   - The function `func_1(s)`:
     - Converts the string `sChar` into a list of characters.
     - Initializes `left` and `right` pointers and a `cost` variable.
     - Iterates through the string to find positions where a swap can reduce the cost.
     - Swaps characters when a '0' is found to the left of a '1' and updates the cost.
     - Moves the `left` and `right` pointers appropriately to find the next possible swaps.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1(s)` seems to correctly identify positions where a swap can be made to reduce the cost.
   - It correctly calculates the cost of each swap by the length of the substring involved.
   - The algorithm iterates through the string and performs necessary swaps until no more swaps can reduce the cost.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted, the function returns 0, which is correct.
   - If the string has no '1's or '0's, the function will also return 0, which is correct.
   - The function handles the cyclic shift by swapping characters directly, which is a valid approach.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - There are no apparent errors in the logic or implementation.

Correctness: **True**
