Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in how the function `func_1` processes the string and calculates the cost. Here are the key points of concern:

1. **Incorrect Swap Logic**: The current implementation of swapping '1' and '0' characters and calculating the cost is flawed. It assumes that every swap between a '1' and a '0' will be counted as a separate operation with the cost being the distance between them. However, the problem allows for cyclic shifts of substrings, which means we should consider larger substrings where possible to minimize the total cost.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The current cost calculation (`cost += right - left + 1`) is not aligned with the allowed operations (cyclic shifts). Cyclic shifts should be considered as a whole block move, and the cost should reflect the minimal moves required to bring all '1's to the left and '0's to the right.

3. **Logic Flow**: The current logic only checks for the first occurrence of '0' and '1' and swaps them without considering the cyclic nature of the shifts. This leads to an incorrect cost calculation and may not produce the optimal solution.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
