### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(s)` to compute the minimum cost.
   - The function `func_1(s)`:
     - Converts the string `sChar` into a list of characters.
     - Initializes `left` and `right` pointers and a `cost` variable.
     - Iterates through the string to find positions where a swap can reduce the cost.
     - Swaps characters when a '0' is found to the left of a '1' and updates the cost.
     - Moves the `left` and `right` pointers appropriately to find the next possible swaps.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1(s)` seems to correctly identify positions where a swap can be made to reduce the cost.
   - However, the annotated code incorrectly states that the final `cost` will be 16. This is not accurate.
   - The function does not handle the entire string correctly. It only considers the first few characters and does not continue to find all possible swaps.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted, the function returns 0, which is correct.
   - If the string has no '1's or '0's, the function will also return 0, which is correct.
   - The function does not handle the cyclic shift correctly. It only swaps characters directly without considering the cyclic nature of the shifts.

5. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - Consider the example "101011":
     - The function will initially set `left` to 0 and `right` to 1.
     - It finds a '0' at position 1 and a '1' at position 0, so it swaps them and increments the cost by 2.
     - Then it moves `right` to 2 and `left` to 1.
     - It finds a '0' at position 2 and a '1' at position 1, so it swaps them and increments the cost by 3.
     - Then it moves `right` to 3 and `left` to 2.
     - It finds a '0' at position 3 and a '1' at position 2, so it swaps them and increments the cost by 4.
     - Finally, it moves `right` to 4 and `left` to 3.
     - It finds a '0' at position 4 and a '1' at position 3, so it swaps them and increments the cost by 5.
     - At this point, the string is "001111", and the cost is 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14.
     - The function then moves `right` to 5 and `left` to 4.
     - It finds a '1' at position 5 and a '1' at position 4, so it increments the cost by 6.
     - The final string is "001111" and the cost is 14 + 6 = 20.
   - The annotated code incorrectly states that the final `cost` will be 16, which is not true.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - The function does not handle the cyclic shift correctly and does not consider all possible swaps.
