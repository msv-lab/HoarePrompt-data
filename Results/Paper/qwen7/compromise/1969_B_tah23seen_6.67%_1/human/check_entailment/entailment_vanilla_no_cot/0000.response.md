Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. The logic for finding the positions of '0' and '1' and performing the cyclic shifts is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the cyclic shift operation and does not properly calculate the cost.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Cyclic Shift Handling**: The code attempts to swap elements directly without performing a proper cyclic shift. A cyclic shift involves moving the last segment of the substring to the beginning, which is not handled correctly here.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation assumes that the shift is performed by simply swapping elements, but this does not reflect the actual cost of a cyclic shift.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic for finding the positions of '0' and '1' and then performing the shift is overly complex and does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operation.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string by performing cyclic shifts. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. Identify the position where the first '1' appears.
2. Perform cyclic shifts starting from the end of the string until the first '1' is at the start.
3. Calculate the cost of each shift and keep track of the minimum cost.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    n = len(sChar)
    first_one_pos = sChar.find('1')
    
    if first_one_pos == -1:
        return 0  # If there are no '1's, the string is already sorted
    
    cost = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, first_one_pos, -1):
        if sChar[i] == '0':
            cost += i - first_one_pos + 1
            sChar = sChar[i:] + sChar[:i]
    
    return cost
```

This corrected version identifies the position of the first '1', and then performs cyclic shifts from the end of the string towards the first '1', calculating the cost of each shift. This ensures that the string is sorted with the minimum possible cost.
