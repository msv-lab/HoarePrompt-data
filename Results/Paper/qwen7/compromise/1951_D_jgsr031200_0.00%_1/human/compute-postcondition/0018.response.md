Based on the initial state provided:

- `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
- `h` is the sum of `n` divided by each value in `costs`, which means `h = n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1`.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the number `2`.

Output: **2**
