Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The key issue lies in the conditions used to determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero. Specifically, the conditions `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` and `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2` do not accurately reflect the necessary and sufficient conditions for making all elements zero.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that:
1. The sum of all elements in the array is even because each operation reduces the sum by 3.
2. The array can be reduced to zeros through the specified operations.

The provided solution only checks the parity and difference of the first and last elements, which is insufficient. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the logic:

1. Check if the total sum of the array is even.
2. Ensure that no element is greater than the sum of the remaining elements after removing it and applying the operation.

Here is a corrected implementation:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(a) % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue

        # Check if the array can be reduced to zeros
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] > sum(a) - a[i]:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

# Example usage
func()
```

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
