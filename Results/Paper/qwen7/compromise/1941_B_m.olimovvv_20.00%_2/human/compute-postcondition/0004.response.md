Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. It checks if the first two elements of `a` have a difference of 2 and are both odd, or if the last two elements of `a` have a difference of 2 and are both odd. If either condition fails, it prints "NO"; otherwise, it prints "YES". After processing all test cases, the function outputs "YES" or "NO" for each case based on the conditions checked.**
