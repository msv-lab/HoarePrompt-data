Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `nums.get(start, 0)`. This means that the loop will continue as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is truthy (i.e., non-zero).

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `start` is 0.
   - `vis` is an empty set.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - The loop will execute the first time if `nums.get(start, 0)` is non-zero.
   - Given that `start` is 0, we need to check if `nums.get(0, 0)` is non-zero.
   - Since `nums.get(0, 0)` returns 0 if the key `0` is not present in the dictionary `nums`, the loop will not execute the first time unless there is some value at `nums[0]`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `nums.get(0, 0)` is non-zero for the loop to execute the first time. This means that `nums` must contain the key `0` with a non-zero value.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is 0, `nums` must contain the key 0 with a non-zero value**
