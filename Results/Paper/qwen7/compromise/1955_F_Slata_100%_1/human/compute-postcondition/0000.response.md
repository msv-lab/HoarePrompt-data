Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `int(input())`. Therefore, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1 for the loop to start executing.

3. **Adjust the States**: Since `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `int(input())` should be `t`. This means that the input value must be `t` for the loop to start executing.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input value must be `t`.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input value must be `t`**
