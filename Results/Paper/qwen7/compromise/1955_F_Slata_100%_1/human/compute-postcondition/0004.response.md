Functionality: **The function processes four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. It calculates the total count of elements in the sequence by summing the quotients of each count divided by 2 and adding 1 if the sum of their remainders equals 3. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated result for each input set.**
