Based on the initial state provided, the `beautiful_count` variable holds the total count of pairs \((num, case)\) such that certain conditions are met for each `num` in `case['array']`. The `print` statement outputs this count in a formatted string.

Since the exact conditions and the contents of `case['array']` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `beautiful_count`. However, we know it represents the total count of such pairs.

Output: **Beautiful pairs count: [beautiful_count] (where [beautiful_count] is the total count of pairs (num, case) meeting the specified conditions)**
