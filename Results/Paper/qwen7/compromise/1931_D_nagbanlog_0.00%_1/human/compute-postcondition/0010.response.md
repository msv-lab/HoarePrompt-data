Output State: **`mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x.**

Explanation: The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This means that `required_mod_x` is the remainder when `x - mod_x` is divided by `x`. The values of `mod_y`, `a`, and `mod_x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
