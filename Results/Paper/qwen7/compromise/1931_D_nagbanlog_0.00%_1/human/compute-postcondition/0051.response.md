Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by the number of times the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` appears in `freq` for the new `case`; `results` is a list containing the current value of `beautiful_count`; `mod_y` is the remainder of the last `num` (from the new `case`) divided by `y`; `mod_x` is the remainder of the last `num` (from the new `case`) divided by `x`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`; `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from `case['params']`; `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `case['array']` to the variable `a`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `beautiful_count`, `results`, `mod_y`, `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the new variable `a` is introduced with the value of `case['array']`.
