Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `case` which is iterating over `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**:
   - `beautiful_count` is incremented by the number of times the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` appears in `freq` for each iteration.
   - `results` is a list containing the current value of `beautiful_count`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder of the last `num` divided by `y`.
   - `mod_x` is the remainder of the last `num` divided by `x`.
   - `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each `case` in `test_cases`.
   - For each iteration, `beautiful_count` is updated based on the occurrences of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq`.
   - `results` is updated to contain the current value of `beautiful_count`.
   - `mod_y` and `mod_x` are recalculated based on the last `num` for each `case`.
   - `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` are recalculated based on `mod_x` and `mod_y`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `test_cases`, the only variable that changes from one iteration to another is `case`.
   - All other variables (`beautiful_count`, `results`, `mod_y`, `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) will be recalculated based on the new `case`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The next `case` will be the next element in `test_cases`.
   - `beautiful_count`, `results`, `mod_y`, `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` will be recalculated based on the new `case`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by the number of times the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` appears in `freq` for the new `case`; `results` is a list containing the current value of `beautiful_count`; `mod_y` is the remainder of the last `num` (from the new `case`) divided by `y`; `mod_x` is the remainder of the last `num` (from the new `case`) divided by `x`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.
