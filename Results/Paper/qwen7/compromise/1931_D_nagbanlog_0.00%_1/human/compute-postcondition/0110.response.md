Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
       )
   ```

Given the initial state, we know:
- `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`, which means if `mod_x` is 0, `required_mod_x` will also be 0; otherwise, it will be `x - mod_x`.
- `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the following:
- `Number: num`
- `mod_x: mod_x`
- `mod_y: mod_y`
- `required_mod_x: (x - mod_x) % x`
- `required_mod_y: mod_y`

Putting it all together, the output will be:

Output: **Number: num, mod_x: mod_x, mod_y: mod_y, required_mod_x: (x - mod_x) % x, required_mod_y: mod_y**
