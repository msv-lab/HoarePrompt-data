Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

This means that the frequency count for the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` has been incremented by 1. Additionally, the `beautiful_count` has been increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The values of `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged from their previous values.
