Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` is updated by adding `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` to its current value.**

Explanation:
- The line `beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` increments `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.
- `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`.
- `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `beautiful_count` is updated based on the current value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.
