Output State: **`beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is no longer present in `freq`.**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `freq` by setting the value at the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` to `0`. This does not affect the values of `beautiful_count`, `mod_y`, `a`, `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`. However, it ensures that the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is no longer present in `freq`.
