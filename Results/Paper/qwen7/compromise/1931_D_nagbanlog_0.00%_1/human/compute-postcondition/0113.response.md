Postcondition: `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, and `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
