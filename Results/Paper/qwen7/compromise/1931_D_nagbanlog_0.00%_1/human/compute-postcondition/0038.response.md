Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by 1, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple \((required_mod_x, required_mod_y)\) is now present in `freq` with a frequency of 2 if \((mod_x, mod_y)\) was already in `freq`; otherwise, the tuple is present with a frequency of 1. `num` is the first element of `a`. `required_mod_y` is set to `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` does not change the value of `required_mod_y`, it simply reassigns it to the current value of `mod_y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
