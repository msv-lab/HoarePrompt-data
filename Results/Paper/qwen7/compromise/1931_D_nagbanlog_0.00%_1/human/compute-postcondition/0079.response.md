Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 0, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The code sets `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` to 0, which means the frequency count for the specific pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` is reset to 0. The other variables (`beautiful_count`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) retain their previous values as per the initial state.
