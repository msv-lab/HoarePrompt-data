Output State: **`mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`; `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

This means that the value of `required_mod_y` has been updated to be equal to `mod_y`, while the other variables (`mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
