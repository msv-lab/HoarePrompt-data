Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

This means that the `beautiful_count` variable is incremented by the value stored in `freq` at the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)`. The values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
