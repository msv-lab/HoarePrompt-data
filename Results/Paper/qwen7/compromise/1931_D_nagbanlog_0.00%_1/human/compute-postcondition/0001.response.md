Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable in the given for loop is `case`.
   - The object being iterated over is `test_cases`, which is a list of test cases.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Loop:**
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - Each test case in `test_cases` is a list containing three integers \(n\), \(x\), and \(y\) such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\).
   - Each test case also includes a list of \(n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - The sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

3. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element. If `test_cases` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The initial value of `case` will be the first element of `test_cases`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `test_cases` must have at least one element.
- `case` will be the first element of `test_cases`.

**Final State:**
State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `test_cases` must have at least one element, and `case` is the first element of `test_cases`.**
