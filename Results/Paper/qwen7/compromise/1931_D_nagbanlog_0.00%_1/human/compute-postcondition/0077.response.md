Postcondition: `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is further incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.
