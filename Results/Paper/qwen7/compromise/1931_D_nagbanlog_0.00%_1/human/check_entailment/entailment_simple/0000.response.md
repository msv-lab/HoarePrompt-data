### Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each element of the array and using modular arithmetic to find pairs that satisfy the conditions for being "beautiful". However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Modular Arithmetic Calculation**: The program calculates `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` incorrectly. Specifically, it should use `(num - mod_x) % x` for `required_mod_x` and `(-mod_y) % y` for `required_mod_y`. The current implementation uses `(x - mod_x) % x`, which does not correctly account for negative values.

2. **Pair Counting Logic**: The logic for counting the number of beautiful pairs is flawed. The program checks if a pair exists in the frequency dictionary but does not correctly update the frequency dictionary with the required values.

3. **Test Case Handling**: The program assumes that `test_cases` is a list of dictionaries, but the problem description suggests that `test_cases` should be a list of lists. This mismatch in data structure could lead to errors.

Given these issues, the provided program is not correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
