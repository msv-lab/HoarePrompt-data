### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified a small mistake in the calculation of `required_mod_y`. Specifically, it stated that `required_mod_y` should be `mod_y` instead of `mod_y`. Let's re-evaluate the program with this correction in mind.

1. **Modulo Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `required_mod_x` is correct: `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - The calculation of `required_mod_y` should be `mod_y` itself, not `mod_y`.

2. **Frequency Dictionary Usage**:
   - The frequency dictionary is correctly used to count occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
   - The logic for counting beautiful pairs is correct.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints intermediate values for debugging, which is useful but not necessary for correctness.

### Corrected Code:

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        freq = {}
        beautiful_count = 0
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y  # Corrected here
            print(f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}')
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the example test case:
- `n = 6`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`
- `a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`

The program should correctly identify the beautiful pairs:
- Pair `<1, 5>`: `a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10` (divisible by 5) and `a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8` (divisible by 2).
- Pair `<4, 6>`: `a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10` (divisible by 5) and `a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2` (divisible by 2).

The program should output `2` for this test case.

After making the correction, the program should now correctly identify and count the beautiful pairs as per the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The corrected program now accurately implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions.
