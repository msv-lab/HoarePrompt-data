The function processes a list `a` of non-negative integers within a specified range `[l, r]`. It ensures that all elements in this range are either zero or equal to `r - l + 1`. If any element is not zero and not equal to `r - l + 1`, it is set to `r - l + 1`, and the operation is recorded in the `ops` list. The function recursively processes the range starting from `l + 1` to `r` after making changes. The final state of the list `a` and the `ops` list reflect these operations.
