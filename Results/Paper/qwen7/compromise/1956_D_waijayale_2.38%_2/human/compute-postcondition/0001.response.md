Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is an input integer between 0 and 10^7**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The length of this list `a` is equal to the value of `n`, which is also an input integer. Each element in the list `a` is an integer between 0 and 10^7, as specified in the initial state.
