Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function ensures that all elements in a specified range `[l, r]` are either zero or equal to `r - l + 1`. It recursively processes the range and updates the array accordingly. This helps in setting the maximum possible value in the specified range to maximize the sum.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function initializes the process by calling `recursive_maximize_sum` and returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations. It correctly handles the overall logic of maximizing the sum and recording the operations.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**: This function is designed to maximize the sum of a sublist by setting all elements to the maximum possible value under certain conditions. It uses `func_1` to ensure the sublist is set to the desired value. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function reads input, calls `func_2` to get the necessary values, and prints the results. It correctly formats and outputs the required information.

Given the execution summaries and the logical structure of the functions, they collectively meet the problem requirements. Each function plays a specific role in ensuring that the array's sum is maximized through the allowed operations.

Correctness: **True**
