You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Output

    1 1
    1 1
    
Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements. Specifically, the `func_1` function is not correctly setting the values within the specified range to the MEX value. Here’s an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
1 3 9
```

The expected output should be:
```
13 0
```

However, the provided program will not produce this output because it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and updating the array. For instance, in the given example, the array remains unchanged, and the sum is still 13, but the program incorrectly outputs 0 operations, which is not optimal.

To fix this, the `func_1` function needs to correctly compute the MEX for the subarray and update all elements in the range `[l, r]` to this MEX value. The current implementation does not ensure that the MEX is correctly calculated and applied to the subarray.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    subarray = a[l:r+1]
    mex = 0
    seen = set(subarray)
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    for i in range(l, r + 1):
        a[i] = mex
    ops.append((l, r))
```

This corrected function ensures that the MEX is correctly computed and applied to the subarray. With this fix, the program should work as expected for all valid inputs.
