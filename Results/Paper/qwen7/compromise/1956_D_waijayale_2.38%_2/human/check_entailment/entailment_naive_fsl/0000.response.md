Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements. Specifically, the `func_1` function is not correctly setting the values within the specified range to the MEX value. Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
1 3 9
```

The expected output should be:
```
13 0
```

However, the provided program will not produce this output because it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and updating the array. For instance, in the given example, the array remains unchanged, and the sum is still 13, but the program incorrectly outputs 0 operations, which is not optimal.

To fix this, the `func_1` function needs to correctly compute the MEX for the subarray and update all elements in the range `[l, r]` to this MEX value. The current implementation does not ensure that the MEX is correctly calculated and applied to the subarray.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(a, l, r, ops):
    if l == r:
        if a[l] != 0:
            ops.append((l, l))
            a[l] = 0
        return
    subarray = a[l:r+1]
    mex = 0
    seen = set(subarray)
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    for i in range(l, r + 1):
        a[i] = mex
    ops.append((l, r))
```

This corrected function ensures that the MEX is correctly computed and applied to the subarray. With this fix, the program should work as expected for all valid inputs.
