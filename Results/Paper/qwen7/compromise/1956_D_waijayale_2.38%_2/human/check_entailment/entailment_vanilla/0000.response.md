Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function recursively sets all elements from `l` to `r` to the value `r - l + 1`.
   - The base case is when `l == r`. If `a[l]` is not zero, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends `(l, l)` to `ops`.
   - The function is called recursively for `l + 1` to `r`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
   - It returns the sum of the array `a`, the number of operations `len(ops)`, and the operations list `ops`.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function is designed to maximize the sum of the subarray `a[l:r + 1]`.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` to set all elements to `r - l + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and calls itself recursively for the left and right parts of the subarray excluding the position of the maximum element.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum, number of operations, and the operations list.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It then prints each operation in the format `(l + 1, r + 1)`.

### Reasoning

1. **Base Case Handling**: The base case in `func_1` correctly handles the scenario where `l == r` and ensures that the element is set to zero if it is not already zero.

2. **Recursive Operation**: The recursive call in `func_1` ensures that the entire subarray is updated correctly.

3. **Maximization Logic**: In `recursive_maximize_sum`, the logic to check if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` and then setting all elements to `r - l + 1` is sound. This ensures that the subarray is filled with the smallest possible value that maximizes the sum.

4. **Finding Maximum Element**: The logic to find the maximum element and then recursively call `recursive_maximize_sum` on the left and right parts is correct. This ensures that the entire array is processed to maximize the sum.

5. **Output Formatting**: The output formatting in `func_3` is correct, ensuring that the operations are printed in the required format.

Given that the logic in each function is sound and the overall approach correctly maximizes the sum of the array while adhering to the constraints, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the analysis of the functions.
