Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each line `i` (where `0 â‰¤ i < n`), the output will contain the result of the condition check based on the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` provided as input for that iteration. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the output will reflect the results of the loop's execution based on the inputs given during each iteration.
