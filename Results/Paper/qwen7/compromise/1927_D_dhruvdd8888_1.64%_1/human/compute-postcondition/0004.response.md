Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is 0, `e` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `e` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `nums`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `e` is updated to 0.
