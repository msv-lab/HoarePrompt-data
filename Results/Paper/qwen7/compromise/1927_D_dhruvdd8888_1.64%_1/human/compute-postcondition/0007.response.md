Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with an additional element `-1` appended, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first element of the list `nums`, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends `-1` to the list `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, `num`, and `arr` stay the same as they were in the initial state. The only change is that `nums` now includes an additional element `-1`.
