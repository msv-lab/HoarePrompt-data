Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`N`), the array itself (`nums`), and the number of queries (`q`).
3. It then processes each query by finding the relevant segment in the `arr` list using binary search (`bisect_left`).
4. Based on the position of the segment relative to the query bounds (`l` and `r`), it correctly prints the appropriate indices or `-1, -1`.
5. The logic for determining the output based on the segment positions is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

Given the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to handle the queries as required. However, there are a few potential issues that could affect correctness:
- The use of `sys.stdin.readline()` for reading input might not be necessary since `input()` should suffice.
- The handling of the special case when `s == 1` in the segment processing logic might not be optimal.

Despite these minor concerns, the core logic of the program seems to be correct and should produce the expected output based on the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
