The function processes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) to find specific indices related to the string representations of numbers from 0 to n-1. It first identifies the index of the first character that is less than a certain character across these numbers. Then, it finds the minimum index among those that satisfy a specific condition. Finally, it calls another function `func_2` with the identified maximum and minimum indices. The function does not return any value.
