State: **`max_index` is 0, `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 (since the range is from 0 to `n-1`).
3. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
4. Given that `n` is an input integer within the range 2 to \(10^4\) and `n` is not equal to 2, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1.
5. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 and `n` is within the specified range.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
