### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form \(? a b c d\) to compare \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
   - After finding the optimal pair, we print the answer in the form \(! i j\).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` is used to ask a query and get the result.
   - `func_2` is used to provide the final answer.
   - `func_3` is the main function that implements the logic to find the optimal pair.

3. **Logic Breakdown:**
   - For \(n = 2\), it directly prints the answer \(! 0 1\) without further queries, which is correct.
   - For \(n > 2\):
     - It initializes `max_index` to 0.
     - It iterates through indices from 0 to \(n-1\) to find the index with the highest \((p_0 \mid p_i)\). This is done by comparing \((p_0 \mid p_{max\_index})\) with \((p_0 \mid p_i)\).
     - It then finds the minimum index among those that have the same \((p_{max\_index} \mid p_i)\) as \((p_{max\_index} \mid p_{min\_indices[0]})\).
     - Finally, it compares the results to find the optimal pair.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The approach seems logical and should work for finding the optimal pair.
   - The code correctly handles the base case \(n = 2\).
   - The main loop to find the maximum XOR is implemented correctly.
   - However, the logic to find the optimal pair is flawed. The current implementation only considers the minimum index among those that have the same \((p_{max\_index} \mid p_i)\) as \((p_{max\_index} \mid p_{min\_indices[0]})\), but it does not ensure that the pair \((p_{max\_index}, p_{min\_index})\) maximizes the XOR.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case \(n = 2\) correctly.
   - For larger \(n\), the logic to find the optimal pair is incorrect. The current implementation does not guarantee that the pair found maximizes the XOR.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program is incorrect because the logic to find the optimal pair of indices is flawed. The current implementation does not ensure that the pair \((p_{max\_index}, p_{min\_index})\) maximizes the XOR.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
