Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Let's consider the following example:

Input:
```
3
5
00000
00000
01110
01110
01110
```

This grid clearly forms a triangle, but the program does not handle this case correctly. The program checks if the counts of '1's in each row are the same, which would indicate a square. However, for a triangle, the counts of '1's in each row will not be the same.

The program should check for both conditions (triangle and square) and return "TRIANGLE" if the grid matches the triangle pattern, and "SQUARE" if it matches the square pattern. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results for grids that form triangles.
