Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Shapes**: 
   - The program only checks if the first and second elements of the list `k` are equal. This is insufficient to determine if the grid contains a triangle or a square.
   - For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row follows a specific pattern (2*i-1 for the i-th row).

2. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The program does not check the entire grid to see if the pattern of '1's matches that of a triangle or a square.
   - There is no logic to verify if the '1's form a continuous shape or if they follow the required patterns for a triangle or a square.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - Even if the first and second elements of `k` were equal, this would only indicate a potential square, but it does not cover all cases for determining a triangle.
   - The program lacks any mechanism to handle the case where the grid contains a triangle.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
