Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `a`. Since the initial state of `t` is given as an integer between 1 and 100, and the new assignment does not affect `t`, `t` remains unchanged. The variable `a` is now assigned the value of the input integer, which is guaranteed to be between 2 and 10.
