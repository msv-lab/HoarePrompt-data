Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is the final input integer which is one more than the last input integer provided during the loop executions, `i` is the total number of iterations (which is equal to the sum of all integers input during the loop executions), `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's from all input strings `b` provided during the loop executions. The value of `b` is the last input string provided by the user, and the postcondition remains unchanged as long as the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`. However, since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be between 1 and 100, `a` will be the sum of all integers input during the loop, `i` will be the total number of iterations, `k` will contain the cumulative count of '1's from all input strings, and `b` will be the last input string. The if condition does not alter the state of `k` or `b` unless the first and second elements of `k` are equal, but even then, the state does not change due to the lack of an else part.
