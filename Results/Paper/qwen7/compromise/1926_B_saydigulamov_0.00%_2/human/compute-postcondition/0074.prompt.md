You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each string containing n characters that are either '0' or '1'. It is guaranteed that the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is the final input integer which is one more than the last input integer provided during the loop executions, `i` is the total number of iterations (which is equal to the sum of all integers input during the loop executions), `k` is a list containing the cumulative count of '1's from all input strings `b` provided during the loop executions. The value of `b` is the last input string provided by the user, and the postcondition remains unchanged as long as the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`. However, since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be between 1 and 100, `a` will be the sum of all integers input during the loop, `i` will be the total number of iterations, `k` will contain the cumulative count of '1's from all input strings, and `b` will be the last input string. The if condition does not alter the state of `k` or `b` unless the first and second elements of `k` are equal, but even then, the state does not change due to the lack of an else part.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented as a list of n strings, where each string contains n characters ('0' or '1'). The grid is guaranteed to contain exactly one triangle or one square with all '1's, and the size of the shape is greater than 1. The function returns whether the shape found is a triangle or a square.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
