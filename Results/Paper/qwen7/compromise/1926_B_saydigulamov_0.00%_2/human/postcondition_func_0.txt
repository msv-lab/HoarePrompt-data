The function processes a grid represented as a list of n strings, where each string contains n characters ('0' or '1'). It counts the number of '1's in each row and stores these counts in a list. If the first two counts in the list are equal, it prints the list. The function does not return any value but prints the list of counts if the specified condition is met.
