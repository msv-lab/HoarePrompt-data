Given the initial state and the code snippet:

- `i` is `2 * n`, where `n` is the original value of `k`.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- The current value of `i` is such that `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Value of `i`:**
   - We know `i = 2 * n`, where `n` is the original value of `k`.

2. **Condition for `l[a[i] - 1]`:**
   - The statement `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` tells us that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is 2.

3. **Value of `a[i]`:**
   - Since `l[a[i] - 1] == 2`, it means that `a[i] - 1` is the index in `l` that holds the value 2.
   - Therefore, `a[i] - 1` must be the index of the number 2 in the list `l`.
   - This implies that `a[i]` is the index in the list `l` where the value 2 is located plus one.

4. **Printing `a[i]`:**
   - The `print` statement will print `a[i]` twice, separated by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Since the exact values of `a` and `l` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[i]`. However, we know that `a[i]` is the index in `l` where the value 2 is located plus one.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **a[i] a[i]**
