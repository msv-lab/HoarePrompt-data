Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the output consists of the elements printed during each iteration. Given that the loop runs up to the third iteration and the condition `ul != ur` is true, the loop continues to execute. After all iterations, the output state is as follows:

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations: Postcondition: The output consists of the elements printed during each iteration, which are `a[3] a[3]` and `a[4] a[4]`, separated by spaces. The variable `i` is set to `5`, indicating that the loop has completed its iterations. The value of `n` remains less than or equal to 3, and the array `r` has been updated such that the elements indexed by `a[3] - 1` and `a[4] - 1` are set to 0. The variable `ur` is incremented by 2 for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, resulting in `ur` being 4. The variable `ul` remains unchanged unless it equals `ur`, in which case the loop would break, but since the problem states that `ul != ur`, the loop completes all iterations.
