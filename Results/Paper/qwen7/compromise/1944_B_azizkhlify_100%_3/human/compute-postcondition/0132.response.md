Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will iterate over all elements in `res` such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, starting from `2 * n - 1` down to `n`. For each `i`, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, it will be printed twice and then set to 0, increasing `ur` by 2. If `ul` equals `ur`, the loop will break. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, the process continues as described.**
