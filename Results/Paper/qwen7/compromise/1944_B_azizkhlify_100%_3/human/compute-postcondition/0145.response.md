Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(n)`.

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
   - `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`).

Given the above points, let's adjust the states:

- The previous value of `i` was `i`, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`**
