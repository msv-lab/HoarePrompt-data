Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `re` is 1, and `res` is a list containing `a[1]`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is not within any loop or conditional block, it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `re`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
