Output State: **`i` is `current_i + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ul` is `current_ul + 4`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Given the initial conditions, `i` is `current_i + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ul` is `current_ul + 4`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` was already equal to 0. Since the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged (it was already 0), all other variables and their relationships remain the same.
