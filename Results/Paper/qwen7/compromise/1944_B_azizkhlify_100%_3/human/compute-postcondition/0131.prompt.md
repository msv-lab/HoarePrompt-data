Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and `i` will iterate over all elements in `res` such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is `4 * k - ul`, and `ul` is `k * 2`. The `res` list contains all elements that meet the condition `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and `i` starts from `n-1` as specified in the initial state. The current value of `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, the condition holds true. If `r[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 2, the condition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was previously equal to 2; otherwise, it remains unchanged. Additionally, if `ul == ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, `ur` is increased by 2, and no changes occur if `r[a[i] - 1]` is not equal to 2. If `ul` equals `ur`, then `ur` is further increased by 2 and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
