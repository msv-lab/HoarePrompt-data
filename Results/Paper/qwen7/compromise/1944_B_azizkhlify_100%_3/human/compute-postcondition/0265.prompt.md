Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing each element of the list `res` exactly once. Since the loop iterates over each element in `res` and there were initially three elements (`a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]`), the output will be `a[1] a[2] a[3]`. The variable `i` will hold the last element of `res` after the loop finishes, which is `a[3]`. The variable `res` will be empty after all elements have been printed. The variable `re` remains unchanged at 2. Additionally, the upper limit `ul` is not equal to the lower limit `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 3, and if `ul` is equal to `ur`, the loop or if statement we were inside is broken out.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be at least 3, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, then `ur` is incremented by 2 and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0. If `r[a[i] - 1]` does not equal 2, the conditions remain unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be at least 3, and `ur` remains 0 unless `ul` equals `ur` and `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, in which case `ur` becomes 2 more than its initial value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
