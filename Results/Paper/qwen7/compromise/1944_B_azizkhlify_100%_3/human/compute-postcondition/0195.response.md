Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is the original value of `k`.
   - The element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is equal to 1.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The statement is `print(a[i], end=' ')`.

Given that `i` is 0, we need to determine the value of `a[i]`.

- Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is the same as `a[0]`.
- The element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is equal to 1. This means that `l[a[0] - 1] = 1`.

From this, we can infer that `a[0] - 1` must be the index of the element in list `l` that is equal to 1. Therefore, `a[0]` must be 2 because `l[1] = 1` (since `a[0] - 1 = 1` implies `a[0] = 2`).

So, `a[i]` (which is `a[0]`) is 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `a[0]`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
