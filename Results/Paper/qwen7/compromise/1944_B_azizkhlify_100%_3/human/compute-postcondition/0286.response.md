Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration).
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n + 1`.

### Adjusting the State:
- The variable `i` needs to be updated to `n + 1`.
- The variable `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented again during this iteration, but its value is not directly relevant to the loop condition.

### Final State:
- `i` is now `n + 1`.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented during this iteration, but its exact value is not specified in the loop head.

### Answer:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`**.

So, the final state to be adjusted for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`**.
