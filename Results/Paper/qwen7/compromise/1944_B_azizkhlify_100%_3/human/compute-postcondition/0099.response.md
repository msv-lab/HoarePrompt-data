Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - According to the initial state, `i` starts from `n-1` and the loop iterates up to `2*n-1`.
   - Therefore, when the loop starts, `i` should be `n-1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue executing**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < 2*n`.
   - When `i` reaches `2*n`, the loop terminates.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop head variables**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` starts at `n-1` and that the loop will continue until `i` is less than `2*n`.

Given these points, we can summarize the required adjustments:

- `i` should be `n-1` at the start of the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged and is an integer between 1 and 5000.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000**
