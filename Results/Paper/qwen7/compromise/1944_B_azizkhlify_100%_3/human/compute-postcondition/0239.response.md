Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 3, and the current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0; `ur` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `ur` is incremented by 2, but the initial values of `i`, `n`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `ur` by 2 while keeping the other variables in their original conditions.
