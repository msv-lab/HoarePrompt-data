Output State: **`i` is `n`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r` at the index `a[i] - 1` by 1. Since the initial state only mentions that `i` is `n`, and no other variables are mentioned, we assume that `a` and `r` are already defined and contain appropriate values. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `n`, and the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
