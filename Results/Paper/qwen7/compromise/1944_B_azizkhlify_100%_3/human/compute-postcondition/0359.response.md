Based on the initial state provided, `res` must contain at least one element. However, no specific value or type of `res` is given, nor is the value of `i` defined. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state and there's no way to determine its value from the given information, we can only state that `i` is some integer value.

Given this, the `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space, but without knowing the exact value of `i`, we can only describe it as an integer.

Output: **i (where i is an integer)**
