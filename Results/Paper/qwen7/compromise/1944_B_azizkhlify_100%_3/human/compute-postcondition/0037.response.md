Output State: **`i` is current_i + 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `ul` is current_ul + 2, `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0**

Explanation: The code `l[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Since `a[i] - 1` was previously equal to 0, this assignment does not change the value of `l[a[i] - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
