Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - `l` is a list where the element at index `a[0] - 1` is 0
   - `ul` is 4 if `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 2; otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `l`, and `ul` remain unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `i` and `n`, we need to check the condition `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 1, `n` must be greater than 1 (i.e., `n > 1`).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list where the element at index `a[0] - 1` is 0, and `ul` is 4 if `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 2; otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `l`, and `ul` remain unchanged.**
