Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is now 0.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` changes the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0. Since `r[a[i] - 1]` was previously equal to 2 (as per the initial condition), it is now set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
