Output State: **`i` is 4; `n` is less than or equal to 3; `ur` is 2.**

The variable `ur` is incremented by 2, starting from an unspecified initial value (since it was not defined in the initial state). Given no other information about `ur`, we assume it starts at 0 for calculation purposes. After incrementing, `ur` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.
