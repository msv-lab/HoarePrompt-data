Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` remains the same, `r[a[i-1] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` updates the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by incrementing it by 1. However, since `i` is now `n + 2`, the relevant index in `r` will be `a[n+1] - 1`. The initial state specifies that `r[a[i-1] - 1]` is incremented by 1, but since `i` is now `n + 2`, the correct index to consider is `a[n+1] - 1`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the increment operation is applied to `r[a[n+1] - 1]`.
