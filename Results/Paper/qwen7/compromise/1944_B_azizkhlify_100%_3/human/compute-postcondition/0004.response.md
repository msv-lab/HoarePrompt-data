Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `k` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `l` is a list of n zeros, `r` is a list of n zeros.**

The code initializes a new list `r` with `n` zeros. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, or `l`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The only new variable `r` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.
