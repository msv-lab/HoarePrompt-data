Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `current_i + 1`
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000
   - `ul` is `current_ul + 4`
   - `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0, and it is also given that `ul == k * 2`

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `current_i + 1`. This means `i` is an integer that is one more than `current_i`.
- `a` is a list, and `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`.
- `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0, meaning the element `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is 0.
- `ul` is `current_ul + 4`, and it is also given that `ul == k * 2`.

However, the specific values of `a`, `l`, `current_i`, `current_ul`, and `k` are not provided. Therefore, we need to focus on the values that are explicitly stated or can be derived from the given conditions.

The print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space. Since `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0, it implies that `a[i]` is an index in the list `l` where the value is 0. But this does not affect the print statement directly.

Given the information, the print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i]**
