Output State: **`l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**.

In this case, the code increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` by 1. Since the initial values of other variables are not specified, they remain unchanged. The only affected variable is `l[a[i] - 1]`, which is incremented by 1.
