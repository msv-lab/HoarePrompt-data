Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder and typically represents the loop counter. However, since it is a placeholder and does not store any meaningful value, we do not need to adjust its state.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. This input determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: Since the loop will run based on the input, we need to ensure that the input condition is met. The input should be a positive integer within the specified range (1 to 5000).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself, ensuring it falls within the valid range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **the input must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ input ≤ 5000**
