Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 (though the exact value of `n` is not needed for this specific task).
   - `a` is a list of integers. We need to know the first element of `a` to determine the value of `l[a[0] - 1]`.
   - `l` is a list where the element at index `a[0] - 1` is 0.
   - `ul` is 4 if `l[a[0] - 1]` equals 2; otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `l`, and `ul` remain unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 2.
- Since `l` is defined such that `l[a[0] - 1]` is 0, it means that `l[a[0] - 1]` is 0, which does not match the condition for `ul` to be 4. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `l`, and `ul` remain unchanged.

Given that `i` is 2, we need to find `a[2]`. However, since the exact contents of `a` are not specified, we can only say that `a[2]` is the third element of the list `a`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the third element of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[2] a[2]**
