Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is the second element in `res`.

Given this, `i` is the second element of the list `res`. Since `res` contains at least one element, it must have at least two elements to define `i`.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **[second element of res] **
