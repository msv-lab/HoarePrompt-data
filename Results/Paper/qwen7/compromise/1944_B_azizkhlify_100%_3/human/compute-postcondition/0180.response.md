Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2 * n`.
   - `n` is the upper bound of the range for the loop.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is increased by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2 * n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but it is not modified here based on the given information.

5. **Postconditions**:
   - The postcondition `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 0 is not relevant for adjusting the state at the start of the loop.
   - The postcondition `ul` is increased by 4 is not relevant for adjusting the state at the start of the loop.
   - The condition to break out of the loop if `ul` equals `k * 2` is not relevant for adjusting the state at the start of the loop.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
- `i` is `2 * n + 1`
- `n` remains the same (unchanged from the previous iteration)

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `n` is the same as before**
