Given the initial state:
- `i` is `2 * n + 1`
- `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:
1. The value of `i` is `2 * n + 1`.
2. The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the value of `a[i]` is not explicitly provided, we can only describe it in terms of the index `i` and the list `a`.

Output: **a[2 * n + 1] a[2 * n + 1]**
