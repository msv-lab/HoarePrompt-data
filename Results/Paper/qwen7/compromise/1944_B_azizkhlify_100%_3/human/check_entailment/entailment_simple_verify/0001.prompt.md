You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: Output State: The output will consist of pairs of identical numbers from the array `a`, printed in the order they are found, until `k` pairs have been printed. Once `k` pairs are printed, any remaining single occurrences of these numbers (from the first part of the array `a`) will be printed next, up to `k` such numbers. Finally, any pairs found in the second half of the array `a` will be printed, again in the order they are found, until `ul` (the count of pairs found in the first half) equals `ur` (the count of pairs found in the second half).
    #
    #To summarize, the output will be a sequence of pairs and single numbers from the array `a`, printed according to the rules specified in the loop, ensuring that all conditions for `k` pairs and `k` single numbers are met before moving on to the second half of the array. The exact content of the output will depend on the specific values of `n`, `k`, and the array `a`, but it will always follow the described pattern.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `l` and `r` are initialized with zeros.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are initialized to zero.
   - An empty list `res` is created to store elements for the second part of the solution.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program counts how many times each element appears in the first half of the array (`l`).
   - It counts how many times each element appears in the second half of the array (`r`).

4. **Constructing `l`:**
   - The program tries to fill `l` with pairs of elements that appear exactly twice in the first half.
   - If it finds `k` pairs, it breaks out of the loop.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - If there are remaining elements needed to complete `l`, it takes single occurrences from the first half and adds them to `res`.

6. **Printing `l`:**
   - It prints the elements of `l`.

7. **Constructing `r`:**
   - The program fills `r` with pairs of elements that appear exactly twice in the second half.
   - If `l` and `r` have different numbers of elements, it adjusts `r` to match the number of elements in `l`.

8. **Printing `r`:**
   - It prints the elements of `r`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Construction of `l`:**
   - The program attempts to fill `l` with pairs of elements that appear exactly twice in the first half. However, this approach might not always work because it only considers exact pairs and ignores the possibility of using single occurrences to balance the XOR values.

2. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - The logic for handling remaining elements in `l` is flawed. It only considers single occurrences from the first half, which might not be sufficient to balance the XOR values.

3. **Construction of `r`:**
   - The program constructs `r` by filling it with pairs of elements that appear exactly twice in the second half. This might not always result in a valid solution because it doesn't consider the XOR values of `l` and `r`.

4. **Balancing XOR Values:**
   - The program does not ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal. It only tries to construct `l` and `r` without considering the XOR constraints.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
