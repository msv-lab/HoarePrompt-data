Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape on the grid is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Triangle Detection**: The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a triangle. However, this logic is flawed because a triangle can have more than one row with '1's. For example, a triangle with `k=3` would have the second and third rows with two '1's each, but the program would incorrectly classify this as a triangle.

2. **Square Detection**: The program checks if any row contains more than one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a square. This logic is also flawed because it doesn't account for the specific pattern required for a square. For instance, a square with `k=3` would have all three rows with three '1's each, but the program would incorrectly classify this as a square if there was any deviation from this pattern.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to check for both the triangle and square patterns explicitly:

- For a triangle, check if the '1's form a symmetric pattern around the center column.
- For a square, check if the '1's form a symmetric pattern across the rows.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if grid[i][n // 2] == '0':
            return False
        for j in range(n // 2 - i, n // 2 + i + 1):
            if grid[i][j] == '0' or grid[n - i - 1][j] == '0':
                return False
    return True

def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if grid[i][i] == '0' or grid[n - i - 1][n - i - 1] == '0':
            return False
        for j in range(i, n - i):
            if grid[i][j] == '0' or grid[j][i] == '0' or grid[n - i - 1][j] == '0' or grid[j][n - i - 1] == '0':
                return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_triangle(grid):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        elif is_square(grid):
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("NO SHAPE")

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks for the patterns of a triangle and a square and outputs the correct shape.
