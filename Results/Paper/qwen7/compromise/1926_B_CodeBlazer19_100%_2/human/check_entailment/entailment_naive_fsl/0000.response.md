Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. The program checks if each row contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to determine a triangle. For example, consider the following grid:
```
000
011
011
```
This grid contains a triangle, but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because the second and third rows both contain more than one '1'.

2. The program checks if each row contains more than one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a square. This is also not sufficient. For example, consider the following grid:
```
0000
0000
0111
0111
```
This grid contains a square, but the program would incorrectly identify it as a triangle because the first two rows contain only one '1'.

To correctly identify the shape, the program needs to check for the specific patterns of a triangle and a square. Specifically, it should:
- Check if the grid forms a triangle by verifying the pattern of increasing and then decreasing '1's in the rows.
- Check if the grid forms a square by verifying the pattern of constant '1' counts across rows.

Since the provided program does not handle these cases correctly, it is incorrect.
