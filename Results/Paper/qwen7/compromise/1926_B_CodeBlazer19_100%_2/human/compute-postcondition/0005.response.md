Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is not explicitly initialized in the given state, but it will be set to 0 at the start of each iteration.
   - `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is the variable that controls the number of iterations.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j < n`.
   - At the start of the loop, `j` is set to 0, so the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
   - There is no specific initialization needed for `j` other than setting it to 0 at the start of the loop.

5. **Consider the initial values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b`**:
   - These variables are not directly related to the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (it must be greater than 0) and `j` (which will be set to 0 at the start of the loop).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
