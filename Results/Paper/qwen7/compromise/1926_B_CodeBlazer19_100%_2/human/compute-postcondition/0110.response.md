Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the input string provided by the user.**

The code `b = 'SQUARE'` assigns the string `'SQUARE'` to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
