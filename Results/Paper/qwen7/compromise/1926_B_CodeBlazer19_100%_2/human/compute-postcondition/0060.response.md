Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either '' or 'SQUARE', `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n`, `s` is the last input string provided, and `s` is updated to the new input string.**

The code assigns the string `'TRIANGLE'` to the variable `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
