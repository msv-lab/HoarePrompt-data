Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `s` is a string input from the user.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'TRIANGLE'` to the variable `a`. This changes the value of `a` but does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `b`, `n`, `j`, or `s`. The precondition for `a` being 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1' remains unchanged, but since no condition was checked to assign a specific value to `a`, it is now explicitly set to `'TRIANGLE'`.
