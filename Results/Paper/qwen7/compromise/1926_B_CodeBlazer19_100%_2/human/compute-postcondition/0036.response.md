Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2 (since the loop runs until `j` is less than `n`), and `s` is the last string input from the user after all iterations of the loop have completed.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 100, `i` will remain 0, and `a` and `b` will reflect whether any of the input strings met the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `n` will still be greater than 0, `j` will be equal to `n-1`, and `s` will hold the last input string provided.
