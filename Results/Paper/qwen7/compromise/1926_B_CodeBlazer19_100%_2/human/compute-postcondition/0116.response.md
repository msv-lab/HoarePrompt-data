Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string, 'SQUARE', or 'TRIANGLE', `n` is the total number of inputs provided by the user, `j` is 0 (since `j` starts from `n-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0), `s` is the last input string provided by the user. After all iterations of the loop, if any input string `s` contained exactly one '1', then `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'. If no input string contained exactly one '1', `a` remains 0. The variable `b` will be 'SQUARE' if any input string contained more than one '1', otherwise, it remains either an empty string or 'TRIANGLE'.
