Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is 'FS', `j` is 6, and `n` is 4**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is initially either 'F' or 'S'. The code `nx += 'S'` concatenates the string 'S' to `nx`. Since `nx` was either 'F' or 'S', after the operation, `nx` becomes 'FS'. The values of the other variables (`total`, `i`, `j`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
