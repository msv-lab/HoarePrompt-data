Output State: **`x` is a list of characters, `j` is previous_j + 1, and `n` is such that previous_j + 1 <= n, and the character at x[previous_j] must be either 'F' or 'S'; `a[i]` is incremented by 1.**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Since no specific value for `a` or `i` was given initially, we only know that `a[i]` has been incremented. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
