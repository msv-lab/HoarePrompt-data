Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, `x` is an input string, `j` is 4, `a[1]` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[1]` by 1 because `i` is 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `n` must still be at least 3, `x` remains an input string, `j` is still 4, and `a[1]` is increased by 1.
