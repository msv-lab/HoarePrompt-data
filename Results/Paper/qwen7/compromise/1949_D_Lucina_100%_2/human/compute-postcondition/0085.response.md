Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `2`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[j]` increased by 1, `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x[j - 1]` is 'S'.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially `1`, after executing the code, `j` becomes `2`. Therefore, `b[j]` (which was `b[1]` before) is now incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
