Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given `for` loop is `j`. The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is less than `4`
   - `n` is `3`
   - `nx` is either `'SF'` or `'FF'`
   - `j` is `2`
   - `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Since `n` is `3`, the loop will run for `j` values from `1` to `4`.

4. **Previous Iteration**: In the previous iteration, `j` was `2`. For the loop to continue, `j` must be incremented to `3`.

5. **Adjusting the State**: We need to update the value of `j` to `3` because it needs to be within the range `1` to `4` for the loop to continue.

6. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`i`, `n`, `nx`, and `xx[i][j - 1]`) do not change based on the loop itself and are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is less than `4`, `n` is `3`, `nx` is either `'SF'` or `'FF'`, `j` is `3`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`**
