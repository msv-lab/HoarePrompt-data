Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `a[i]` is 0, `b[i]` is 0, `sa` is a list containing the numbers from 1 to `n` with 1 appended, `sb` is a list containing the numbers from 1 to `n`, and the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**

Explanation: The code `sa.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `sa`. Since `i` was initially 1, after the append operation, `i` increments by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `sa` now contains the numbers from 1 to `n` with an additional 1 appended to it.
