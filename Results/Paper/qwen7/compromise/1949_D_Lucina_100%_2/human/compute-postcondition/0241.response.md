Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`, and `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'. `nx` is increased by 'S'.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends 'S' to the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` was either 'F' or 'S', appending 'S' to it will result in 'FS' if `nx` was 'F', or 'SS' if `nx` was 'S'. However, since the exact value of `nx` before the operation is not specified, we can only say that `nx` is now a string that is the result of appending 'S' to its original value. The other variables (`xx`, `i`, `j`, and `sa`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
