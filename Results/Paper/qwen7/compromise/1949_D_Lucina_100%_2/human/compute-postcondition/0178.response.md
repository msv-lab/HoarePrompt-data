Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 1
   - `nx` is either 'FF', 'FS', 'SF', or 'SS'
   - `j` is 3
   - `n` is 4

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue if `j < n`. In the previous iteration, `j` was 3 and `n` was 4, so the loop will continue because `3 < 4`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 (since it starts from 1 and increments by default in the range function). Therefore, `j` will become 4.

5. **Maintain the value of `n`**: Since `n` does not change within the loop, it remains 4.

6. **Keep other variables unchanged**: The values of `total`, `i`, and `nx` remain the same as they are not involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `nx` is either 'FF', 'FS', 'SF', or 'SS', `j` is 4, `n` is 4**
