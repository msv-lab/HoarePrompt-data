Output State: **`x` is a list of characters, `j` is previous_j + 1, `n` is such that previous_j + 1 <= n, and the character at x[previous_j] must be either 'F' or 'S', `b[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `j` is updated to be `previous_j + 1`, and the condition that the character at `x[previous_j]` must be either 'F' or 'S' is still valid.
