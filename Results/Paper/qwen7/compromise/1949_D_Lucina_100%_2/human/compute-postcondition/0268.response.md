Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed.
   - `a[2]` is 0.
   - `b[2]` is 0.
   - `sb` has appended the value 2 and now contains [2, 2].

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `i` is 2, it means the loop has executed 2 times.
   - Therefore, `n` must be 2.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from 2 to 3.
   - `n` remains the same as it is the total number of iterations, which is 2.
   - `a[2]` and `b[2]` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `sb` will be modified during the loop body, but since we are only adjusting the loop head state, we don't change `sb` here.

5. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` is 2 (unchanged).
   - `a[2]` is 0 (unchanged).
   - `b[2]` is 0 (unchanged).
   - `sb` is [2, 2] (unchanged).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 2, `a[2]` is 0, `b[2]` is 0, `sb` has [2, 2]**
