Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `nx` is 'F', `j` is 2, `n` is 4, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and either `i` is in `sa[:1]` or `j` is in `sa[:1]`**.

Explanation: The variable `nx` is concatenated with the string 'F', making `nx` equal to 'F'. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding `i` and `j` being in `sa[:1]` remains the same.
