Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a[2]` is yet to be determined, `b[2]` is 0, `sa` is a list containing the values 1 and 2, `sb` is a list containing the value 1, `sb` now contains the value 2.**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 2, to the list `sb`. Initially, `sb` contained the value 1. After appending, `sb` now contains both 1 and 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.
