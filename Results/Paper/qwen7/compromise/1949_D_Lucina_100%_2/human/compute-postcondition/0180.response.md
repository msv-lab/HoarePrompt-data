Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `nx` is either 'FFF', 'FSF', 'SFF', or 'SSF', `j` is 4, `n` is 4**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is concatenated with the string 'F'. Since `nx` can be one of 'FF', 'FS', 'SF', or 'SS', appending 'F' to each of these results in 'FFF', 'FSF', 'SFF', or 'SSF'. The values of `total`, `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged.
