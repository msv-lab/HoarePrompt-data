Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is the value of `xx[5][4]` plus the value of `xx[5][4]`, `j` is 5, and `n` is 4.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Given that `i` is 5 and `j` is 5, `j - 1` is 4. Therefore, `nx` is updated to be the current value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[5][4]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
