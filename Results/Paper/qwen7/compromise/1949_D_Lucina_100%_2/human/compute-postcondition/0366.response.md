Postcondition: `i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 2, and `nx` is either 'x', 'S', or 'F' based on the following conditions: 
- If `xx[4][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated to 'x', 'S', or 'F' accordingly.
- If `xx[4][1]` is '?', then `nx` is either 'xS', 'FS', 'SF', or 'xF'. Specifically, `nx` is 'xS', 'FS', or 'SF' if `i` or `j` is found in the substring `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'xF'.
