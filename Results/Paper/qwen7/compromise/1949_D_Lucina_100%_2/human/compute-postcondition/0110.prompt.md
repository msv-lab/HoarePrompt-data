Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros; `b` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros; `xx` is a list containing a single empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = input()
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if x[j - 1] == 'F':
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
            b[i] += 1
            b[j] += 1
    xx.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `x` is an input string, `j` is 5, `xx` is a list containing the string `x`, and either `a[5]` is increased by 1 if `x[4]` is 'F', or `b[5]` is increased by 1 if `x[4]` is 'S', or no changes are made to the variables if `x[4]` is neither 'F' nor 'S'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be set to `n`, `j` will be `n + 1`, and both `a` and `b` will be lists of length `n + 1`. The list `xx` will contain one element which is the list `x`. For each index `k` from 2 to `n + 1`, if the character `x[k - 2]` is 'F', then `a[k]` will be the count of 'F's before index `k - 1` in `x`; if the character `x[k - 2]` is 'S', then `b[k]` will be the count of 'S's before index `k - 1` in `x`. The variable `xx` is appended with the list `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element has been incremented based on the occurrences of 'F' in the input list `x`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element has been incremented based on the occurrences of 'S' in the input list `x`, `xx` contains two elements: the first is the list `x` and the second is the list `x` again, and `x` remains unchanged with its value assigned from `input()`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
