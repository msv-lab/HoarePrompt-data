Output State: **`x` is a list of characters, `j` is previous_j + 1, `n` is such that previous_j + 1 <= n, and the character at x[previous_j] must be either 'F' or 'S', `b[i]` is incremented by 1.**

The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. No other variables are affected, so the conditions and values of `x`, `j`, `n`, and the character at `x[previous_j]` remain unchanged.
