Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `nx` is either 'FS' or 'SF', `j` is 3, `n` is 4**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` attempts to add the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. However, the variable `xx` is not defined in the given initial state, and no default value is provided. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, `j - 1` would be 2. Given that `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', it is a string, and adding another character to a string results in concatenation. Therefore, `nx` becomes either 'FS' or 'SF'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
