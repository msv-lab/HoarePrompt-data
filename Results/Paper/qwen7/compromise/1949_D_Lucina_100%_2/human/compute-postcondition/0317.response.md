Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `nx` is 'S', `j` is 3, and either `i` is in `sb[:1]` or `j` is in `sb[:1]`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string (`''`), after executing this line, `nx` becomes `'S'`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and the condition involving `sb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
