Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 3, n is 3, a[3] is 0, b[3] is 0, sa is [1, 2, 3], sb is [2, 2, 3].
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'S'
        else:
            nx += 'F'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is less than 4, `n` is 3, `nx` is either 'SFSFSF' or 'FFSFSF', or `nx` is one of 'SFSFSS', 'FFSFSF', 'SFFS', 'FFFS', 'SFFSS', 'FFFSS', 'SFFF', or 'FFFF', `j` is 3, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 4, and `nx` is 'FSSF'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 4, `n` is 3, `j` is 3, and `nx` is a string that can be one of the following: 'x' + `xx[4][2]`, 'S' + `xx[4][2]`, 'F' + `xx[4][2]`, 'xS' + `xx[4][2]`, 'FS' + `xx[4][2]`, 'SF' + `xx[4][2]`, 'xF' + `xx[4][2]`, 'xS', 'xF', 'xSF', 'FSF', 'SFxF', or 'xFxF'. 

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (from `j = 1` to `j = 3`), the variable `nx` will contain a string built up from the conditions checked within the loop. The exact content of `nx` depends on the values of `xx[4][0]`, `xx[4][1]`, and `xx[4][2]`, as well as whether `i` (which remains 4) and `j` (which reaches 3) are in the specified sublists `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
