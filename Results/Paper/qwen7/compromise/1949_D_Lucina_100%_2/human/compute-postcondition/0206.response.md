Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 5, `nx` is 'F' (assuming `xx[i][j - 1]` was not '?'), `j` is 5, and `n` is 4**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string stored in `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` is either the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if it is not '?', or 'F' or 'S' if it is '?'. Since no specific value for `xx[i][j - 1]` is given and it is not specified to be '?', we assume `xx[i][j - 1]` was not '?', making `nx` equal to 'F'. The other variables (`total`, `i`, `j`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
