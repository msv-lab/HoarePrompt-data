Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 1, `nx` is either 'FFS', 'FSS', 'SFS', or 'SSS', `j` is 4, `n` is 4**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Since `nx` can be one of the strings 'FF', 'FS', 'SF', or 'SS', appending 'S' to each of these results in 'FFS', 'FSS', 'SFS', or 'SSS'. The values of the other variables (`total`, `i`, `j`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
