Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`. For the loop to continue executing, `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `x` is a list of characters.
   - `j` is an index within the list `x`.
   - The postcondition specifies the conditions under which `a[j]` or `b[j]` are modified based on the character at `x[j-1]`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be `previous_j + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j <= n`, so for the next iteration, `j` should be `previous_j + 1` and it must still satisfy `j <= n`.

5. **Check the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - The character at `x[j-1]` must be either 'F' or 'S' for the loop to continue without raising a `TypeError`.

Given the above points, let's determine the new state for the next iteration:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `previous_j` and `n` is unchanged.
- For the next iteration, `j` will be `previous_j + 1`.
- The condition `j <= n` must hold true.
- The character at `x[j-1]` (which is `x[previous_j]`) must be either 'F' or 'S'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`x` is a list of characters, `j` is previous_j + 1, and `n` is such that previous_j + 1 <= n, and the character at x[previous_j] must be either 'F' or 'S'.**
