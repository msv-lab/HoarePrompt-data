Postcondition: **`i` is less than 4, `n` is 3, `nx` is either 'SF' or 'FF', `j` is 2, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, considering the given conditions. If the if condition is true, `nx` becomes either 'SF' or 'FS'. If the else condition is true, `nx` becomes either 'SF' or 'FF'. Since the else condition covers the case where the if condition is false, the final value of `nx` will be either 'SF' or 'FF'.
