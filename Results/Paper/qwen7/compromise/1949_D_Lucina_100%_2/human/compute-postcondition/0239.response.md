Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`, and `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'; `nx` is increased by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', otherwise `nx` remains as 'F' if either `i` or `j + 1` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, and 'S' otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` is increased by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `nx` is updated to 'F' if either `i` or `j + 1` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, and 'S' otherwise. The initial conditions and the nature of `nx` are preserved, only its value is updated based on the condition.
