Output State: **`i` is less than `4`, `n` is `3`, `nx` is either `'SFF'` or `'FFF'`, `j` is `3`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is concatenated with the string `'F'`. Since `nx` was either `'SF'` or `'FF'`, after adding `'F'`, it becomes either `'SFF'` or `'FFF'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
