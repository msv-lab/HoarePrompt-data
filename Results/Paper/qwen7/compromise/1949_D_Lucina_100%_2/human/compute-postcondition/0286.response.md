Output State: **`i` is less than 4, `n` is 3, `nx` is 'F', `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?, `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the end of the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string (`""`), after executing this line, `nx` becomes `'F'`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
