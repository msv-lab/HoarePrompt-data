Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is either `1` or `2`, `a` is a list of length `n + 1`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with `b[j]` increased by 1 if `j` is `2`, `xx` contains one element which is the list `x`, and `x` remains unchanged with its value assigned from `input()`. If `x[j - 1]` is `'F'`, then `a[j]` is `2`. Otherwise, `j` is set to `2` and `b[j]` is increased by 1.
