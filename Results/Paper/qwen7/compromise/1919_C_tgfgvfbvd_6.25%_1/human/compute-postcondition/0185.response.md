Output State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n + 1`, `b` retains its last assigned value, `c` retains its last assigned value, `a` retains its final value from the previous iteration, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits the input into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `l`. The values of `y`, `x`, `b`, `c`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
