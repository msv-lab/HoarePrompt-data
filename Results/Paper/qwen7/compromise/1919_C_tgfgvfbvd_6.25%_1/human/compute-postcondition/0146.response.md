Output State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `b` is the element at index `n` in list `l`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the element at index `x` (which is `n`) in the list `l` to the variable `b`. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, and `b` is the element at index `n` in the list `l`.
