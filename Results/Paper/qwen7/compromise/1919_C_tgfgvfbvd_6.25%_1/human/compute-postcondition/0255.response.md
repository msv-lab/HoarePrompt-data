Postcondition: `y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n + 1`, `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` and `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`.
