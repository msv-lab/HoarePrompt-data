Postcondition: `n` is greater than 3, `y` is equal to `n - 1`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is incremented by 1 and `l[x]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `l[x]` is set to `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `l[x]` is set to `a`. Otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`.
