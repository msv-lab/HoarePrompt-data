Postcondition: `n` is greater than 3, `y` is equal to `n - 1`. If the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, then `l[x]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `l[x]` is equal to `a`. Otherwise, `l[x]` is equal to `b`.
