Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `y` is equal to `n-1`, `x` is equal to `n`, `c` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the maximum value among `l[1]` to `l[n-1]` that satisfies `l[y] > l[y-1]`, and if no such values exist, `a` remains 0, `b` is the second maximum value among `l[1]` to `l[n-1]` that satisfies `l[y] > l[y-1]`, and if no such values exist, `b` remains 0; `l` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user, converts each integer to a string, and then maps each string to an integer, storing the resulting list in `l`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `y`, `x`, `c`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged, and `l` is updated to the new list of integers.
