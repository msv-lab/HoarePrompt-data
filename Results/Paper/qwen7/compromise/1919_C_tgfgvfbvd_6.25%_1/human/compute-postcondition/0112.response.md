Output State: **`y` is 3, `b` is `l[3]`**.

The code `b = l[y]` assigns the value at index `y` of list `l` to variable `b`. Given that `y` is 3, `b` is set to the element at index 3 of list `l`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 is not directly impacted by this line of code, so it remains valid.
