Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. It returns information based on the given test case, ensuring the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**
