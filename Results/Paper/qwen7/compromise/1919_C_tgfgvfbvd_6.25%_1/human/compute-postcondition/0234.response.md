Postcondition: `y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `n` is greater than 1, and `l[x]` is either equal to `a` or `b`. If `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `l[x]` is set to `a`; otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`. If the condition `l[x] < a and l[x] < b` is false, then `l[x]` remains unchanged, and `l[x]` is equal to `a` if `a` is equal to `l[x]` or `l[x]` is equal to `b` and `a` is less than `l[x]`.
