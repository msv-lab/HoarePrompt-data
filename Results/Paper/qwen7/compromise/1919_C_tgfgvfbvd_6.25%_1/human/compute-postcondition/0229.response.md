Output State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `l[x]` is equal to `a`, and `a` is equal to `l[x]`**.

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the value of `l[x]` to `a`. Since `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` and `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, the value of `a` becomes exactly equal to `l[x]`. All other variables (`y`, `x`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
