Postcondition: `n` is greater than 3, `y` is equal to `n - 1`, `x` is `n + 1`. If the value at index `x` of list `l` minus `a` is greater than or equal to the value at index `x` of list `l` minus `b`, then the condition holds as is. Otherwise, the condition switches, meaning the value at index `x` of list `l` minus `b` is greater than the value at index `x` of list `l` minus `a`.
