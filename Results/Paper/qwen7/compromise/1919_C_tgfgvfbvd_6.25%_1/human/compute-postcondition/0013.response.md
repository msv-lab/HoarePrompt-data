Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables that can change during each iteration of the loop. In this case, the loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for y in range(1, n):
   ```
   The variables involved here are `y` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `y` is currently 1.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop starts with `y = 1`.
   - After the first iteration, `y` will be incremented by 1, making it `y = 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `y` must be within the range defined by `range(1, n)`, which means `y < n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `y` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, after the loop increments `y` by 1, `y` will become 2.
   - The condition `n > 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `y` becomes 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `y` is 2**
