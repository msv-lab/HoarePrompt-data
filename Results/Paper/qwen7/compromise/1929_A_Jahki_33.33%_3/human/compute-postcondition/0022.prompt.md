You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, and num2 is not used and can be ignored as it does not appear in the problem description or the function definition.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `order` will be determined by how many times the condition `a[i - 1] >= a[i]` is true throughout the entire range of the loop. Given that the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = num2 - 1`, the final value of `order` will be the count of indices where the current element is greater than or equal to the next element in the list `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to `num2`, and `num2` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at all. The other elements of the list `a` will retain their original values unless they are explicitly modified within the loop, which is not indicated here.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `order` will hold the total count of adjacent pairs in the list `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element. The variable `i` will be set to `num2`, indicating the end of the loop. The list `a` itself and the value of `num2` will remain as they were initially, unless they were modified outside the given loop.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers, and returns `True` or `False`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns True

Case_2: The program returns False


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
