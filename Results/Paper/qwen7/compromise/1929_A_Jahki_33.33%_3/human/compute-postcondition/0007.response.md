Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, num2):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `num2`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `num2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `order` is 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `num2` must be greater than 1
   - The value of `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and the loop starts from 1 (inclusive), `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `num2` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` will now be 2).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `num2` must be greater than 2.

6. **Keep other states unchanged**: The values of `order`, `a[0]`, and `a[1]` remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`order` is 1, `i` is 2, `num2` must be greater than 2, and the value of `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`**
