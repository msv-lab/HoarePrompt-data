Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `num2`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `order` is 1
   - `i` is 2
   - `num2` must be greater than 2
   - `a[0]` is greater than or equal to `a[1]`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < num2`.

4. **Check the loop condition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `num2`.
   - Since `i` is 2, the loop will continue as long as `num2` is greater than 2.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - `num2` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

6. **Consider the postcondition**: The postcondition states that if `a[1]` (which is `a[i-1]`) is greater than or equal to `a[2]` (which is `a[i]`), then `order` remains 2. However, since this is the start of the next iteration, we don't know the value of `a[2]` yet, so we cannot determine the value of `order` just yet.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `num2`.

**Final State**:
State: **`order` is 1, `i` is 3, `num2` must be greater than 2**
