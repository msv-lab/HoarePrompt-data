Postcondition: **The final value of `order` is 0, indicating there are no adjacent pairs in the list `a` where the first element is greater than or equal to the second element. The variable `i` is set to `num2`, and the list `a` and the value of `num2` retain their initial states unless modified outside the given loop.**
