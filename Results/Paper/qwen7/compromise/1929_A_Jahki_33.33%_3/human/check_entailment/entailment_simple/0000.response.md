Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The key insight is that sorting the array and then calculating the difference between consecutive elements after sorting will yield the maximum possible beauty because the smallest elements will be paired with the largest ones, maximizing the positive differences.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the size of the array (`num2`) and the array elements (`case`).
   - It converts the string input into a list of integers (`a`).
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the maximum beauty is 0 because no rearrangement can increase the beauty further.
   - If the array is not sorted, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function counts the number of inversions in the array (where `a[i-1] >= a[i]`).
   - If the array is sorted (no inversions), it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest ones, maximizing the positive differences.
   - The loop correctly calculates the beauty as the sum of these differences.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the differences between consecutive elements.

Correctness: **True**
