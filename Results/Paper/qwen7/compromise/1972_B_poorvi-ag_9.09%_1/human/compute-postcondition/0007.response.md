Output State: `results` is a list containing either 'no' or 'yes' based on the conditions specified in the loop for each iteration of `i` from `range(t)`. For each iteration, if `n` (an integer input) is even, 'no' is appended to `results`. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in the string `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'no' is appended. The loop prints each element in `results` on a new line.
