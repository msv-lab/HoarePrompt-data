#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; `results` is a list containing 'no' or 'yes' based on the conditions specified in the loop for each iteration of `i` from `range(t)`. For each iteration, if `n` (an integer input) is even, 'no' is appended to `results`. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in the string `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'no' is appended.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing either 'no' or 'yes' based on the conditions specified in the loop for each iteration of `i` from `range(t)`. For each iteration, if `n` (an integer input) is even, 'no' is appended to `results`. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in the string `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'no' is appended. The loop prints each element in `results` on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it determines whether to append 'yes' or 'no' to a results list based on the parity of `n` and the count of 'U' compared to 'D' in the string `s`. Finally, it prints each element in the results list on a new line.
