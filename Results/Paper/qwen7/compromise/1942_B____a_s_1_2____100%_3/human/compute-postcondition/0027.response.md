Output State: **`p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]`, `p[i+1]` is equal to `mex - a[i+1]`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `p[i]` to be `mex - a[i]`. It also updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i+1]`, which was previously `mex - a[i+1]`. The previous values of `p[i+1]` and `mex` (before the update) are preserved, and the new value of `p[i]` is calculated based on the updated `mex`.
