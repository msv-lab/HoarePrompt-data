Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `mex` is `mex_initial`, `p` is `p_initial`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts them into a list of integers. The variables `i`, `mex`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variable `a` is created and assigned the list of integers.
