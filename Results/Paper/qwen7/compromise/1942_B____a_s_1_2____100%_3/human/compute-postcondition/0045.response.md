Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `mex` is the minimum value between the previous `mex` and `p[i]`, and `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` by setting it to the minimum of its current value (`mex`) and the value of `p[i]`. Here, `i` is `n-3`, so `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
