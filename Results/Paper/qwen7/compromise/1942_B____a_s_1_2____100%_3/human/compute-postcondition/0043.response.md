Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `mex` is the minimum value between the previous `mex` and `p[i]`, which is `mex - a[i]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from `i = n-1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` reaches `-1`.
   - At each iteration, `i` decreases by 1.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop is decrementing `i`, the next value of `i` will be `i - 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

5. **New State Calculation:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `n-2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should still be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `n-2` must be greater than or equal to 0, which implies `n >= 2`.

6. **Updating `mex`:**
   - The value of `mex` is updated based on the current `i` and `p[i]`, which is `mex - a[i]`.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, we assume that `mex` is updated according to the rule given.

7. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be `n-2`.
   - `mex` will be the minimum value between the previous `mex` and `p[n-2]`, which is `mex - a[n-2]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `n-2`, `mex` is the minimum value between the previous `mex` and `p[n-2]`, which is `mex - a[n-2]`**
