Output State: **`mex` is now the minimum of its original value and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]`, `p[i+1]` is equal to `mex - a[i+1]`, `p[i+2]` is equal to `mex - a[i+2]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This means `mex` will take the smaller value between its original value and `p[i]`. The values of `p[i]`, `p[i+1]`, and `p[i+2]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
