Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases (`t`). This integer is converted to an integer type using `int()`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases is maintained, and the value of `t` is updated to the integer input received.
