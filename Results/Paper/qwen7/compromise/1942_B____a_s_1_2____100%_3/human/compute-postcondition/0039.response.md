Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`, `mex` is assigned the value `n`.**

The code initializes the variable `mex` with the value of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
