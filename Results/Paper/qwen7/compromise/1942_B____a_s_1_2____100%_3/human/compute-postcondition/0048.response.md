Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `mex` is the minimum value between the previous `mex` and `p[i]`, and `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `p[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum value between its current value (`mex`) and `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is updated to ensure it does not exceed `p[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
