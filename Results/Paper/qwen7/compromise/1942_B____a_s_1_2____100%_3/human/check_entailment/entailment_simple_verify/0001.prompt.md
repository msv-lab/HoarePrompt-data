You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `-1`; `mex` is the minimum value found during the loop execution among `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`; `p[i]` contains the value `mex - a[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A list `p` of size `n` is initialized with `-1` values.
   - A variable `mex` is set to `n`, which will be used to find the MEX value.

3. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The loop runs from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the permutation `p`.

### Reasoning:

1. **Correct Calculation of MEX:**
   - The key idea is to calculate the MEX value for the suffix of the permutation starting from `i` to the end.
   - The value `mex - a[i]` ensures that the MEX value is correctly assigned to `p[i]` because `a[i]` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - This approach works because we are calculating the MEX from the end of the array towards the beginning, ensuring that the MEX value is correctly propagated.

2. **Updating MEX:**
   - The `mex` value is updated to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest unused index in the permutation.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles all edge cases as per the problem statement. It guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists, and the constraints are respected.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
