Postcondition: `c` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` if `s[k] == 'L'`, otherwise `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`. `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD` in both cases. `k` is increased by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `k + 1`. Additionally, either `l` is increased by 1 or `r` is decreased by 1 depending on the condition `s[k] == 'L'`.
