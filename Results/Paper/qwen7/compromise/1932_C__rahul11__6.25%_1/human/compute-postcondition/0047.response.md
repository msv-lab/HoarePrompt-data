Output State: **`ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1, but the exact value of `r` before the decrement is not specified. The other variables (`ans`, `k`, `n`, `res[c]`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
