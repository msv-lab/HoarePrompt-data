Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is no longer the first element of `arr`; `ans` is the product of the original first element of `arr` and the previous value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is multiplied by `i`, which is the first element of `arr`. After this operation, `i` is no longer the first element of `arr` because it has been used in the multiplication. The value of `ans` is updated to be the product of its previous value and `i`.
