Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` is the product of the current `i` and the previous value of `ans`.**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `i` with the current value of `ans`. Since `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `ans` was previously the product of the current `i` and the previous value of `ans`, the new value of `ans` will be the product of `i` and the previous `ans`. The precondition that `arr` must contain at least one element remains unchanged, and `i` is still the next element in `arr`. The updated value of `ans` is the product of the current `i` and the previous `ans`.
