Postcondition: `ans` is the value of `ans` after performing either `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD` when the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L' and `l` is increased by 1, or `ans = ans // arr[r-1] % MOD` when the character at index `k` in string `s` is not 'L'. `res[c]` is always equal to `ans % m % MOD`, and `k` is an index within the string `s`.
