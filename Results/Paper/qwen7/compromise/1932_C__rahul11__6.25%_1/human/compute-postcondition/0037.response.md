Postcondition: `k` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to either `ans // arr[l] % MOD` or `ans // arr[r] % MOD` depending on whether `s[k]` is 'L' or not, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is increased by 1 if `s[k]` is 'L', `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', and `c` is increased by 1.
