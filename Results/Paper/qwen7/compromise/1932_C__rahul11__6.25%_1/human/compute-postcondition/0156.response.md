Based on the initial state provided:

- `c` is equal to `n-1`
- `ans` is the final value of `ans` after all iterations
- `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`
- `l` is `n-1`
- `r` is 0

The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the list `res`.

To determine what exactly will be printed, we need to focus on the value of `res[c]` since it's the only part of `res` that is explicitly described in terms of other variables.

Given:
- `c = n-1`
- `res[c] = ans % m % MOD`

Therefore, `res[n-1]` will be `ans % m % MOD`.

Output: **res[0] res[1] ... res[n-2] res[n-1] (where res[n-1] is ans % m % MOD)**
