Output State: **`c` is 2; `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`; `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`; `k` is `n-1`; `l` and `r` remain unchanged; `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables (`c`, `ans`, `res[c]`, `k`, `l`, and `arr[r]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `r` is now one less than its original value.
