Output State: **`k` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `ans` is the result of dividing the initial `ans` by each element in `arr` from either the left or right based on the string `s`, `res[c]` is the final value of `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is the leftmost index not yet processed, `r` is the rightmost index not yet processed, and `c` is equal to `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the result in the list `arr`. The values of `k`, `ans`, `res[c]`, `l`, `r`, `c`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous values.
