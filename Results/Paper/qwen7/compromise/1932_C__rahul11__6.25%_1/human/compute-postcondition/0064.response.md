Output State: **`ans` is multiplied by the next element from `arr`; `i` is the next element from `arr`.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `ans` by the current value of `i`, which is the next element from `arr`. However, since the initial value of `ans` is not specified, we can only say that `ans` is now `ans * i`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is used in the multiplication but is not re-assigned. Therefore, `i` is still the next element from `arr`.
