Output State: **`ans` is the value of `ans` divided by `arr[l]` and then modulo `MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is an index within the string `s` and the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', `l` is increased by 1.**

The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
