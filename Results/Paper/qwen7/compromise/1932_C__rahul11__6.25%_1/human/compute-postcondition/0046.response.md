Output State: **`ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ans % m % MOD` to `res[c]`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as it is only used in the calculation for `res[c]`. The values of `k` and `n` remain the same as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the updated state includes the new assignment for `res[c]` while keeping the original values of `ans`, `k`, and `n`.
