Output State: **`ans` is the value of `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `k` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ans % m % MOD` to `res[c]`. Since the initial state of `ans` is given as `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `k` is 2, and `n` is greater than 1, these values remain unchanged. The only new information is that `res[c]` is now set to `ans % m % MOD`.
