Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `k + 1`, and `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables (`c`, `ans`, `res`, `k`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than `k + 1` remains valid.
