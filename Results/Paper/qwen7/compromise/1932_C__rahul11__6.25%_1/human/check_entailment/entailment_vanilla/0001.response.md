Reasoning:
1. The given program does not correctly handle the problem as described.
2. The main issues are:
   - The initial product `ans` is calculated before any commands are processed, which means the initial result is incorrect.
   - The program should calculate the product of the remaining elements after each command, but it calculates the product once before starting the loop.
   - The program uses `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6`, which is unnecessary and different from the required modulus `m` specified in the problem.
   - The program initializes `res` with zeros and then overwrites them, but it should only store the results of the operations as specified.
   - The loop runs `n-1` times instead of `n` times, missing the final operation after the last command.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
