Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not always find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). For example, for \(x = 10\), the solution outputs \(y = 5\), but the correct output should be \(y = 5\) as well, but for \(x = 21\), the solution outputs \(y = 10.5\), which is not an integer. The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of \(y\) to find the maximum \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
