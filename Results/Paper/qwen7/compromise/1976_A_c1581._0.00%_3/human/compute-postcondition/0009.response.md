Postcondition: `password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where 1 <= n <= 20, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string; `last_digit_index` is an integer indicating the index of the last digit found in the `password` string, or -1 if no digit was found; the loop has executed all iterations without returning 'NO'. The current state of `digits` is such that it is not sorted.
