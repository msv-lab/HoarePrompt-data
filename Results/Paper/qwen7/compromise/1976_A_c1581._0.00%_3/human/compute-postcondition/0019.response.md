The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `password`. `password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where 1 <= n <= 20, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. The function checks the password and returns 'YES' under certain conditions, and 'NO' otherwise. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a password and return 'YES' based on specific criteria, and 'NO' otherwise.
