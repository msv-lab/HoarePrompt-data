Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits the input into a list called `data`.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary information (`n` and `password`) for each case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it checks if the password meets the conditions specified in the problem statement.
   - It separates the password into digits and letters.
   - It checks if the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - It also ensures that no digit comes after a letter.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It also correctly identifies if any digit comes after a letter.

### Detailed Checks

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**:
   - The code correctly separates digits and letters into two lists (`digits` and `letters`).

2. **Checking Non-Decreasing Order**:
   - The code checks if both `digits` and `letters` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This is done using `sorted(digits)` and `sorted(letters)`.

3. **No Digit After Letter**:
   - The code maintains a `last_digit_index` to track the last seen digit index.
   - If a letter is encountered after a digit, it immediately returns "NO".

### Edge Cases

1. **Empty Passwords**:
   - The provided code handles empty passwords correctly since the sorting check will pass for an empty list.

2. **Passwords with Only Digits or Only Letters**:
   - The code correctly handles such cases as well.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong according to the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
