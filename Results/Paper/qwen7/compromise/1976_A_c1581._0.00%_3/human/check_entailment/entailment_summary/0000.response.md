Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified conditions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This approach handles multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it extracts the necessary information (length of the password and the password itself) and passes it to the `func_1` function.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Separates the password into digits and letters.
   - Checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - Checks if the letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - Ensures there are no digits coming after letters by checking the position of the last digit.
4. **Output**: The program collects the results from each test case and prints them out.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong according to the specified rules. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
