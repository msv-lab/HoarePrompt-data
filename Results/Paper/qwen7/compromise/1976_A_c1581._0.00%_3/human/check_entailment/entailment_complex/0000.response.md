Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. The function `func_1` properly separates the password into digits and letters.
3. It checks if the digits and letters are in sorted order.
4. The logic for checking the order of digits and letters is correct.
5. The function returns 'NO' if any of the conditions are not met and 'YES' otherwise.

Given the provided example and the state transitions, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required logic to verify if a password is strong according to the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
