Output State: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3 * cnt`, `l` is `func_2() + cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is less than `n + 1.

After all iterations of the loop, `cnt` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs and the loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`. Since `l` starts as `func_2() + 1` and increases by 1 with each iteration (as `l = func_2() + 1` is executed at the start of each loop), after `cnt` iterations, `l` will be `func_2() + cnt`. Given that the loop runs until `cnt` becomes 0, the final value of `l` will be `func_2() + cnt`, which is `func_2() + 0` or simply `func_2()`. The value of `i` remains 1 as there is no operation changing its value within the loop. The value of `k` is updated by subtracting 3 for each iteration, so after `cnt` iterations, `k` will be `k - 3 * cnt`. The condition `l < n + 1` must still hold true for the loop to terminate.
