Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 3*(n // k)`, `cnt` is `0 - (n // k)`, and either `cnt` is not equal to 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`. `func_2()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_2()` is called, which does not modify the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, or `cnt`. The condition `either cnt is not equal to 0 or l is not equal to n + 1` remains true because `func_2()` does not change these variables.
