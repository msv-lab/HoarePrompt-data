Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), and `v` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is `n-1`) to `v`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `v` now holds the value of `i`, which is `n-1`.
