Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\)
- `cnt` is `k`
- `l` is 1

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `l` is explicitly given as 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as 0.
- `v` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value. However, since the print statement includes `i * v`, and `i` is 0, the value of `i * v` will always be 0 regardless of the value of `v`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **? 1 0**
