Output State: `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3 * cnt`, `l` is `func_2() + cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is less than `n + 1.

After all iterations of the loop, `cnt` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The value of `l` will be `func_2() + cnt`, which simplifies to `func_2()` since `cnt` becomes 0. Therefore, the final state of `l` will be the result of `func_2()`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states within the loop, with `k` being updated by subtracting `3 * cnt` (which is 0) from its initial value.
