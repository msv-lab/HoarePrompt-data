Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 3`, `cnt` is `cnt - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is decremented by 1. Since `cnt` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing, it remains greater than 0. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.
