Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 2`, `cnt` is `cnt - 1`, `l` is less than `n + 1**.

Explanation: The code `cnt -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `n` remains a positive integer, `k` remains `k - 3`, `l` remains `func_2() + 2`, and `l` remains less than `n + 1`.
