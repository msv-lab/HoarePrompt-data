Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head conditions**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
   - This means the loop continues as long as `cnt` is non-zero and `l < n + 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `k` is `k`
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1 + func_2() + 1`
   - `cnt` is `cnt - 1`

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop head involves two conditions: `cnt` and `l < n + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that both conditions are met for the loop to execute one more time.

4. **Adjust `cnt`**:
   - Since `cnt` is `cnt - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `cnt` must be non-zero.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `cnt` is greater than 0.

5. **Adjust `l`**:
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1 + func_2() + 1`, which simplifies to `2 * func_2() + 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `2 * func_2() + 2 < n + 1`.

6. **Combine the adjustments**:
   - `cnt` must be greater than 0.
   - `2 * func_2() + 2 < n + 1`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `cnt` and `l`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k`, `l` is `2 * func_2() + 2`, `cnt` must be greater than 0 and `2 * func_2() + 2 < n + 1**
