Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 3`, `cnt` must be greater than 0 and `func_2() + 3 < n + 1**.

Explanation: The code changes the value of `l` from `func_2() + 1`. Since `l` was initially defined as `2 * func_2() + 2`, we can express the new value of `l` as `func_2() + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `2 * func_2() + 2 < n + 1` also transforms into `func_2() + 3 < n + 1` due to the change in the value of `l`.
