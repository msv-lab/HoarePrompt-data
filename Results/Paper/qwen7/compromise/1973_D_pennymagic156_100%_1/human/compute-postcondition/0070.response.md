Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3 * 0`, `l` is `func_2() + 0`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is less than `n + 1`, and `cnt` is 1, `l` is 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `cnt` to `k` and `l` to `1`. Given the initial conditions, `k` is `k - 3 * 0`, which simplifies to `k`, and `l` is `func_2() + 0`, which simplifies to `func_2()`. Since `cnt` was initially 0 and now it is updated to `k`, and `l` is updated to `1`, the condition `l < n + 1` remains valid as `l` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, making `l` less than `n + 1` true.
