Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 2`, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `l` is less than `n + 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` to `func_2() + 1`. The previous value of `l` was `func_2() + 1 + 1`, so the new value of `l` is reduced by 1, making it `func_2() + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
