Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `func_2()` must return a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i = 0`.
- `l = func_2() + 1`, and since `func_2()` returns a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`, `l` must be a value between 1 and `n` (inclusive).

However, the value of `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `i * v` without knowing `v`.

Given this information, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for `l` and `i * v`. Since `i = 0`, `i * v` will be 0 regardless of the value of `v`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **'? [l] 0' where l is a value between 1 and n (inclusive)**
