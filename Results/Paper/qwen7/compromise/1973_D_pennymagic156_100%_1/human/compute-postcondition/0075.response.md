Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
2. **Analyze each part of the loop condition**:
   - `cnt`: For the loop to continue, `cnt` must be non-zero (i.e., `cnt != 0`).
   - `l < n + 1`: For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is `k` (unchanged from the previous iteration).
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - `cnt` is 0.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - Since `cnt` is currently 0, it cannot satisfy the condition `cnt and l < n + 1` because `cnt` is zero. Therefore, `cnt` must be adjusted to a non-zero value.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and since `func_2()` returns some value, `l` is already defined. We don't need to change `l` unless `n` changes, but `n` remains a positive integer, so `l < n + 1` can still hold true as long as `func_2()` doesn't return a very large value.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt` to a non-zero value.

Therefore, the modified state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `cnt` is non-zero**
