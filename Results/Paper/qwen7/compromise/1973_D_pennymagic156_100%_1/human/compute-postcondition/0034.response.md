Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `func_2()` returns a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `func_2() + 1` to `l`. Since `func_2()` must return a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`, `l` will be set to a value that satisfies this condition. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `cnt`, and `l` are updated according to the function's return value, but the exact value of `func_2()` is not specified. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
