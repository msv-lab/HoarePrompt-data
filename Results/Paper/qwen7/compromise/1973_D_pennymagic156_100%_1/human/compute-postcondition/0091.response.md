Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is set to `n-1`, where `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is set to `0`.
   - `l` is calculated as `func_2() + 3 * (n // k)`. Since `k` is `0`, the expression `n // k` is undefined because division by zero is not allowed. This means `l` is also undefined.
   - `cnt` is calculated as `0 - (n // k)`. Again, since `n // k` is undefined due to division by zero, `cnt` is also undefined.
   - The condition states that either `cnt` is not equal to `0` or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`. Given the undefined nature of `l` and `cnt`, this condition is not relevant for determining the output of the print statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('! -1', flush=True)`.
   - The string `'! -1'` is explicitly provided and will be printed as is.
   - The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is flushed immediately, but it does not affect the content of the output.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output the string `'! -1'`.

Output: **! -1**
