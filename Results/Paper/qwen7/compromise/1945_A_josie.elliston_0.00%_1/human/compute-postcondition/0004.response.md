Postcondition: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer and `universals` is a non-negative integer. If the number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts` modulo 3 and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, the minimum number of tents required for the `extroverts` and `universals` to be accommodated according to their preferences is returned.
