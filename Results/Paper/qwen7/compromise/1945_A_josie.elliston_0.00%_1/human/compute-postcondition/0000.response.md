Output State: **`introverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of introverts, `extroverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, `universals` is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals, and `ret` is the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` has been called with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments, and the return value of this function call has been assigned to the variable `ret`. The values of `introverts` and `universals` remain unchanged from their initial state.
