### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program has a flawed decoding logic. Let's break down why the original program is incorrect and provide a corrected version.

#### Issues in the Original Program

1. **Incorrect Decoding Logic:**
   - The original program attempts to decode the integer `lex` by appending fixed values (1, 26) to an array `arr` based on incorrect conditions. This does not correctly handle the range of possible values for `lex`.

2. **Flawed Sorting and Output:**
   - The program sorts the array `arr` and then converts the elements to characters. However, the sorting step is unnecessary and does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Cases:**
   - The original program does not correctly handle the range of `lex` values and does not ensure that the resulting word is the lexicographically smallest.

#### Correct Approach

To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to start with the smallest possible values for the letters and incrementally build the word until the sum matches the given encoded value.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        a, b, c = 1, 1, 1
        while a + b + c < lex:
            if c < 26:
                c += 1
            else:
                c = 1
                if b < 26:
                    b += 1
                else:
                    b = 1
                    a += 1
        print(chr(a + 96) + chr(b + 96) + chr(c + 96))

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `a`, `b`, and `c` to 1, representing the smallest possible values for the letters.

2. **Incremental Building:**
   - Use a while loop to increment `c` until the sum `a + b + c` equals the given encoded value `lex`.
   - If `c` exceeds 26, reset `c` to 1 and increment `b`.
   - If `b` exceeds 26, reset `b` to 1 and increment `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - Convert the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to characters using `chr(a + 96)`, `chr(b + 96)`, and `chr(c + 96)` respectively, and concatenate them to form the lexicographically smallest word.

### Final Evaluation

The original program is incorrect due to its flawed decoding logic and unnecessary sorting. The corrected program ensures that the lexicographically smallest word is produced.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
