### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the flaws in the provided program. Let's break down the issues and verify the revised logic:

1. **Original Program Issues:**
   - The logic for decoding the encoded value is incorrect. The program attempts to manually construct the list `arr` based on fixed conditions, which do not accurately represent the possible values of the encoded integer.
   - The sorting and appending logic does not ensure that the lexicographically smallest word is produced.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to start with the smallest possible values for the three letters and incrementally build the word until the sum matches the encoded value.
   - If the current sum exceeds the encoded value, we need to backtrack and adjust the values to find the lexicographically smallest combination.

3. **Revised Program:**
   - The revised program iteratively builds the word starting from the smallest possible values.
   - It ensures that the sum of the values matches the encoded value.
   - If the sum exceeds the encoded value, it backtracks and adjusts the values to find the correct combination.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is read from input, representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `lex` is read, representing the encoded value.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - The program initializes `a`, `b`, and `c` to 1.
   - It enters a loop to increment `a`, `b`, and `c` until the sum `a + b + c` equals `lex`.
   - If `c` exceeds 26, it resets `c` to 1 and increments `b`.
   - If `b` exceeds 26, it resets `b` to 1 and increments `a`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest word formed by converting `a`, `b`, and `c` to their corresponding characters using `chr(a + 96)`, `chr(b + 96)`, and `chr(c + 96)`.

### Verification Using Annotated Code

- **State before the loop:**
  - `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`.
  - `lex` is the encoded value for the current test case.

- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop continues to increment `a`, `b`, and `c` until `a + b + c` equals `lex`.
  - If `c` exceeds 26, it resets `c` to 1 and increments `b`.
  - If `b` exceeds 26, it resets `b` to 1 and increments `a`.

- **Final State:**
  - The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` form the lexicographically smallest word that sums up to `lex`.

### Conclusion

The revised program correctly decodes the encoded value and produces the lexicographically smallest word. The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaws in the original program and the need for a different approach.

**Final: True**
