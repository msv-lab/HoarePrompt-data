State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is an empty string, `j` must be less than 3**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `j`.
2. The loop condition `for j in range(3)` means that the loop will iterate as long as `j < 3`.
3. Currently, `j` is set to 3, which means the loop will not execute because `3` is not less than `3`.
4. To ensure the loop executes, `j` must be less than `3`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `j` is less than `3`, while keeping the other variables in their current state.
