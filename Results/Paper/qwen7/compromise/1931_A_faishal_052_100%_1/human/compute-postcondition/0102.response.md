Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order**.

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the elements of `arr` in-place in ascending order. Since the initial state of `arr` is `[lex]`, after sorting, `arr` will contain the same elements but in sorted order. Given that `arr` initially contained only one element, it remains unchanged in terms of its content but is now sorted.
