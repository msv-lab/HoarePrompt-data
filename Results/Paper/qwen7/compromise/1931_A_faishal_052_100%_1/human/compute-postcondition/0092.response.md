Output State: **`lex` is an integer and `arr` contains the element 26.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append(26)` appends the integer `26` to the list `arr`. This operation modifies the list `arr` by adding the element `26` to it. The value of `lex` remains unchanged as per the initial conditions and the code does not affect its value. Therefore, `lex` stays as an integer, and `arr` now contains the element `26`.
