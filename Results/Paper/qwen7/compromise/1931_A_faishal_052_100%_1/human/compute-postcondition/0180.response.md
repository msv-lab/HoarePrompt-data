Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `cases` is a positive integer.
- `temp` is equal to `chr(info[0][0] + 96) + chr(info[0][2] + 96) + chr(info[0][3] + 96) + chr(info[0][4] + 96)`.

The `print(temp)` statement will print the value of `temp`.

To determine the value of `temp`, let's break down the formula:

- `chr(info[0][0] + 96)` converts the first element of `info[0]` to a character by adding 96 to it.
- `chr(info[0][2] + 96)` converts the third element of `info[0]` to a character by adding 96 to it.
- `chr(info[0][3] + 96)` converts the fourth element of `info[0]` to a character by adding 96 to it.
- `chr(info[0][4] + 96)` converts the fifth element of `info[0]` to a character by adding 96 to it.

Since the exact values of `info[0][0]`, `info[0][2]`, `info[0][3]`, and `info[0][4]` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact characters. However, we know that these characters are derived from the ASCII table where adding 96 to a number results in a lowercase letter (since 'a' in ASCII is 97).

Therefore, the output will be a string composed of four lowercase letters derived from the elements of `info[0]` at indices 0, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

Output: **chr(info[0][0] + 96) + chr(info[0][2] + 96) + chr(info[0][3] + 96) + chr(info[0][4] + 96)**
