Output State: **`lex` is an integer and `arr` contains the element 26**.

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append(26)` appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. This operation does not affect the value of `lex`. Depending on the initial state of `lex`, the conditions mentioned in the initial state are still valid, but now `arr` definitely contains the element 26.
