To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head here includes the variable `i` and the constant `cases`.

Given the information about the loop's behavior:
- For each case (`i` in `range(cases)`), the loop constructs an array `arr` based on the value of `lex`.
- It appends `lex` to `arr`, sorts `arr`, and then adds it to the `info` list.
- After all cases have been processed, `info` will contain a list of lists, where each inner list represents the final state of `arr` for each respective case, sorted in ascending order.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable will take values from `0` to `cases-1` during the loop iterations.
2. **Variable `cases`:** This determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.
3. **Array `arr`:** This array will be constructed and modified within the loop, but its initial state before the loop starts is not specified.
4. **Variable `lex`:** This variable's value will determine how `arr` is constructed and sorted.
5. **List `info`:** This list will accumulate the sorted versions of `arr` for each iteration.

Since the problem specifies the final state of `arr` and `info` after all iterations, we need to ensure that the loop can execute with the correct initial conditions for `i` and `cases`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` should start at `0` and `cases` should be a positive integer to ensure the loop executes at least once.
- `arr` and `info` do not need to be explicitly adjusted as they are initialized and modified within the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `cases` must be a positive integer**

This ensures that the loop can execute and process all cases as required.
