Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is equal to 2; `arr` contains the element 26**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Given that `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, subtracting 26 from it results in a value between 2 and 26 (inclusive). Since the exact initial value of `lex` is not specified, the most precise description is that `lex` is now equal to 2 plus some value between 0 and 24, which simplifies to just stating `lex` is equal to 2 given the constraints. The values of `j` and the contents of `arr` remain unchanged.
