Output State: **The loop executes 3 times in total, with `j` being 2. `lex` is either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27`. The list `arr` contains the elements [26, 26, 1, lex - 2] or [26, 26, 1, lex - 27].**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Since `lex` can be either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27`, the updated list `arr` will contain the original elements plus the new value of `lex`. The number of times the loop executes and the value of `j` remain unchanged.
