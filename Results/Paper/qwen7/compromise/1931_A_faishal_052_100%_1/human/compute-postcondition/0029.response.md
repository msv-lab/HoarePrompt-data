Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is either -26 or between 0 and 52 (inclusive), and `arr` contains the elements 26 and 26.**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 26. Given the initial conditions, `lex` was either less than 52 or between 28 and 78 (inclusive). After subtracting 26, `lex` would be:

- If `lex` was less than 52, it would now be less than 26.
- If `lex` was between 28 and 78 (inclusive), it would now be between 2 and 52 (inclusive).

Since 26 - 26 = 0, the range for `lex` now includes 0. Therefore, `lex` is either -26 (if it was originally less than 26) or between 0 and 52 (inclusive). The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
