Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(2)`. The variables involved are `j`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 2.

4. **Calculate the new state**: Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration (`j = 1`), the next iteration will occur when `j` becomes 2. However, since the loop runs for `range(2)`, it will stop after `j` reaches 1.

5. **Adjust the state**: Given that the loop will not execute again because `j` is already 1 and the loop condition `j < 2` is no longer satisfied, we do not need to change the value of `j`. The other variables `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case does not exist because the loop has completed) remains the same as the postcondition given.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is either less than 52 or between -26 and 52 (inclusive), and `arr` contains the elements 26 and 26**
