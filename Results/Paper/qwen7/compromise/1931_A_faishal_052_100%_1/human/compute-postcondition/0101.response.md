Output State: **`arr` contains the value of `lex`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Since the initial state of `arr` is not specified (other than the fact that its output state depends on the loop and the value of `lex`), the only change is that `lex` is added to the list `arr`. Therefore, the output state is that `arr` now contains the value of `lex`.
