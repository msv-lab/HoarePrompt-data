Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 2.
- `cases` is a positive integer (though its exact value isn't relevant for the print statement).
- `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[2][0] + 96`, and `info[2][1] + 96`, with each character added sequentially in the loop.

Since the loop runs for `j` in `range(3)`, it means `j` takes the values 0, 1, and 2. For each value of `j`, the characters corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[2][0] + 96`, and `info[2][1] + 96` are added to `temp`.

Let's break down the process:

1. When `j = 0`, `temp` gets the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`.
2. When `j = 1`, `temp` gets the character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96` appended to it.
3. When `j = 2`, `temp` gets the character corresponding to `info[2][1] + 96` appended to it.

So, `temp` will be the concatenation of these three characters.

Output: **chr(info[1][0] + 96) + chr(info[2][0] + 96) + chr(info[2][1] + 96)**
