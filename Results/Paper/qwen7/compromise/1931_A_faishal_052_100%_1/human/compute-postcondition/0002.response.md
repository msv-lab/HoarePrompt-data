State: **`cases` is an input integer such that 1 <= cases <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- The condition for the loop to execute is that `cases` must be a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100 (inclusive).
- The state of `info` being an empty list is already correct and does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Thus, the only adjustments needed are ensuring `cases` is within the specified range and setting `i` to its initial value of 0.
