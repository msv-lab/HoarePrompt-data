Output State: **`j` is 0, the value of `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and not less than 52, and the current value of `lex` is less than or equal to 78; `arr` contains the element 26.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `j` is still `0`, `lex` is still within the range `[28, 78]`, and `arr` now includes the element `26`.
