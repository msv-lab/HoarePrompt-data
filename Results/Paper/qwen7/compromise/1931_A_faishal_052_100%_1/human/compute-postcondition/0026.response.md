Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is either less than 52 or between 28 and 78 (inclusive), and `arr` contains the elements 26, 26**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` initially contained the element `26`, after appending `26` again, `arr` now contains the elements `26, 26`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
