Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `info[1][3] + 96`, `j` must be less than 3**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `temp` by appending a character to it. The character is determined by converting the value at `info[1][3]` to its corresponding ASCII value and adding 96 to it. Since `i` was initially 1 and the code increments `i` (though not explicitly shown, implied by the context), `i` becomes 2. The value of `j` remains 3 as it is not modified. The precondition that `j` must be less than 3 is still valid, but since `j` is 3, it no longer satisfies this condition. However, the output state includes the updated value of `i` and the effect on `temp`.
