Output State: **`j` must be less than 2, `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `arr` contains the value 26**.

The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Since `j` must be less than 2 and `lex` is between 28 and 52 (not inclusive), these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the list `arr`.
