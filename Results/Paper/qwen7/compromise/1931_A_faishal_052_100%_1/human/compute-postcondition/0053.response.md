Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the value of `cases`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < cases`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is [26, 26, 26]
   - `lex` is either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive)
   - `info` is a list containing [26, 26, 26]

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to the number of iterations completed so far.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `cases`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be incremented by 1 from its current value.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `arr` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `lex` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `info` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1, if `i` was previously `k`, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `cases`, we can only express the updated state in terms of `cases` and the incremented value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is [26, 26, 26], `lex` is either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive), `info` is a list containing [26, 26, 26], `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `k < cases`**.
