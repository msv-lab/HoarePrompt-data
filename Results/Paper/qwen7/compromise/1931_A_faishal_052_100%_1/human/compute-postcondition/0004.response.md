Output State: **`cases` is an input integer such that 1 <= cases <= 100, `info` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `lex = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `lex`. The other variables (`cases`, `info`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
