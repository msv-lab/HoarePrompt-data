Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(3)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the current state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if `j` is less than 3. However, since `j` is currently 3, the loop will not execute again because `3 < 3` is false.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will not execute again, we do not need to change the value of `j`. The other variables (`i`, `cases`, and `temp`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the state remains unchanged as the loop will not execute again.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `info[1][3] + 96`, `j` must be less than 3**
