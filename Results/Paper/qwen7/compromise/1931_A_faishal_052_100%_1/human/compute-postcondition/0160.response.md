State: **`i` is 0, `j` must be between 0 and 2 (inclusive), `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is an empty string** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `j` is defined in the range function `range(3)`, which means `j` will take values from 0 to 2 (inclusive).
- The initial value of `i` is 0, which does not affect the loop's execution since `i` is not used in the loop itself.
- The variable `cases` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute because the loop will run as long as `j < cases`.
- The variable `temp` is an empty string and does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` (which must be between 0 and 2), `cases` (which must be a positive integer), and `temp` (which remains an empty string).
