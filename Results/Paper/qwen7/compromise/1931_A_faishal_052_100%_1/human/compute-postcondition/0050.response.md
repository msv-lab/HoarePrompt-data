Output State: **`arr` contains the elements 26, 26, 26, `lex` is either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(lex)` appends the current value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Since the loop runs 3 times, `lex` is appended three times. However, the value of `lex` remains unchanged within the loop. If `lex` was less than 28 initially, after the loop, it will be either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive). If `lex` was 28 or more initially, it will be reduced by 78 (26 * 3) and will still be within the range of -26 to 52. The loop's effect on `lex` is already considered in the initial precondition, so no further changes are made to its value. The list `arr` now contains the element 26 three times.
