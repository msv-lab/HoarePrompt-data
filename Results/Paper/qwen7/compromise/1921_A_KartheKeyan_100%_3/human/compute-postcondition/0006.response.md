Output State: **`x` is an integer from the first input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split**.

This means that the code reads two integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to variables `x` and `y`. The exact values of `x` and `y` depend on the input provided by the user, but they are now stored as integers in these variables.
