The loop condition is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is 3. Therefore, `n` does not need to be adjusted since it is already non-zero.

No other states need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head conditions.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` is 3, `x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is a list of four tuples sorted in ascending order based on their first element, `p2` is the square of the difference between the first elements of the third and second tuples plus the square of the difference between the second elements of the third and second tuples, `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`**
