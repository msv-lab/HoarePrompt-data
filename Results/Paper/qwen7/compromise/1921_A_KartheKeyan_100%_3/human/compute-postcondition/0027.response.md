Output State: **`x` is an integer from the first input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, `coord` is a list containing one tuple (x, y)**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `x` and `y` are integers obtained from the first and second inputs respectively, `coord` now contains one tuple consisting of these two integers. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
