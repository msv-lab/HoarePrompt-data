Output State: **`t` is reduced by the number of test cases processed; `s` is the sum of `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each test case; `n` is the input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input, which is taken from the user. The values of `t` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state as no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet.
