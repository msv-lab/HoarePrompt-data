Output State: **`x` is an integer from the second input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, `coord` is a list containing two tuples ((x, y), (x, y)), `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains one tuple `(x, y)`. After appending, `coord` will contain two tuples, both being `(x, y)`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged.
