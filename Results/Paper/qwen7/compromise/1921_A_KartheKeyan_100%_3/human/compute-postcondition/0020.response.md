Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 4.
   - `x` is an integer from the fourth input split.
   - `y` is an integer from the fourth input split.
   - `coord` is a list of four tuples sorted in ascending order based on their first element.
   - `p2` is the square of the difference between the first elements of the third and second tuples plus the square of the difference between the second elements of the third and second tuples.
   - `res` is the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(round(res))
   ```

Given that `coord` is a list of four tuples sorted in ascending order based on their first element, let's denote the tuples in `coord` as follows:
- `coord[0] = (a1, b1)`
- `coord[1] = (a2, b2)`
- `coord[2] = (a3, b3)`
- `coord[3] = (a4, b4)`

Since `coord` is sorted in ascending order based on the first element, we have:
\[ a1 < a2 < a3 < a4 \]

Next, we need to determine the value of `p2`:
\[ p2 = (a3 - a2)^2 + (b3 - b2)^2 \]

Then, we need to find the value of `res`:
\[ res = \sqrt{p1} \times \sqrt{p2} = \sqrt{p1 \times p2} \]

Finally, the `print(round(res))` statement will round `res` to the nearest integer and print it.

Since the exact values of `a1, a2, a3, a4, b1, b2, b3, b4, x, y` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the rounded value of `res`.

Output: **round(sqrt(p1 * ((a3 - a2)**2 + (b3 - b2)**2)))**
