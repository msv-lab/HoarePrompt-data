Output State: **`x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)) sorted by the first element of each tuple, `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The `coord` list, which initially contains four tuples each being `(x, y)`, is sorted based on the first element of each tuple. Since `x` and `y` are the same for all tuples, the sorting will not change the order of the tuples. Therefore, the `coord` list remains the same as before the sorting operation, and `i` remains 4.
