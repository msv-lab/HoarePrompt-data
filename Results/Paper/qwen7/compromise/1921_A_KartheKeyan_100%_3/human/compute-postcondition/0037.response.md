Output State: **`x` is an integer from the fourth input split, `y` is an integer from the fourth input split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y)) sorted by the first element of each tuple, `i` is 4, `p1` is the squared distance between the second and the first point in `coord`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the points represented by the first and second tuples in the `coord` list. Since `coord` is sorted by the first element of each tuple, the first tuple is `(x, y)` and the second tuple is also `(x, y)`. Therefore, both coordinates are the same, resulting in `p1` being `0`. However, since the problem does not explicitly state that `p1` should be updated to `0`, we keep the general form of the calculation.
