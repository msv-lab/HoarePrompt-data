Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 3 of list `l`, `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of list `l`, `l` is updated to a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input as a string, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `l`. The values of `i`, `n`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged, but `l` is now updated to a list of integers.
