Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 0 of list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of list `l`. The value of `q` is equal to `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is assigned the value `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `q` is still equal to `i + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.
