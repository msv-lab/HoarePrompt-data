Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 0 of list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of list `l`. If `q` equals `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.
