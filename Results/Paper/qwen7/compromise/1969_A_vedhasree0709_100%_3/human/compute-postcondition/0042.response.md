Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `j` is 0, `p` is the integer at index 3 of list `l`, `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `j` from 1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
