Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. This means the loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `n` must be greater than 4
   - `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces
   - `j` is 1
   - `p` is the integer at index 3 of list `l`
   - `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of list `l`

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if the user inputs a non-zero value.
   - If the user inputs `0`, the loop will terminate immediately.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - The only variable that can change is the input value for the next iteration, which will determine if the loop continues.
   - If the input is non-zero, the loop will continue. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value is non-zero.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the possibility of the loop continuing based on the user input.

**State:**
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `n` must be greater than 4
- `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces
- `j` is 1
- `p` is the integer at index 3 of list `l`
- `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of list `l`
- The input value for the next iteration must be non-zero

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 4, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 3 of list `l`, `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of list `l`, the input value for the next iteration must be non-zero**
