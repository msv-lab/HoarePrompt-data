Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 3 of list `l`, `q` is the element at index `p - 1` of list `l`, `l` is updated to a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code sets `i` to 0, which changes its value from the initial state where `i` was equal to `n`. All other variables (`n`, `l`, `j`, `p`, `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
