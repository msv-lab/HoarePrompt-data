Output State: **`i` is 4; `p` is `l[3]`; `q` is updated to `l[2]`; `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 3, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 4. The values of `p`, `q`, and `j` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement as mentioned in the initial state.
