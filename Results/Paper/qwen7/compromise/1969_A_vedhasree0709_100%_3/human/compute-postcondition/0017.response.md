Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `p` is the integer at index 2 of list `l`, `q` is the integer at index `p - 1` of list `l`**

Explanation: The code `p = l[i]` updates the value of `p` to be the element at index `i` in the list `l`. Given that `i` is 2, `p` is now the third element in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
