Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[n]`, `q` is `l[l[n]]`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `l`. The values of `i`, `j`, `p`, `q`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
