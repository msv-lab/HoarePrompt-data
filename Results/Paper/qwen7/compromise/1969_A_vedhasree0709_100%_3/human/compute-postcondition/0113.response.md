Output State: The loop will execute as many times as the number of test cases specified by the user. After all iterations, the variables `i`, `j`, `p`, and `q` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `i` will be equal to `n`, `j` will be 1, `p` will be the last element of the list `l` (i.e., `l[n-1]`), and `q` will be the element at the index `p - 1` of list `l` (i.e., `l[l[n-1]-1]`). The program will print "2" during the first successful iteration (when `q == i + 1`) and will print "3" if no such iteration occurs.
