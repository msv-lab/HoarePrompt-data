Output State: **`i` is 3; `p` is `l[3]`; `q` is `l[2]`; `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code `j = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `j`. The values of `i`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states. Specifically, `p` is still `l[3]`, and `q` is updated to `l[2]` based on the initial state where `q` was `l[1]` and then updated to `l[l[3] - 1]`, which is `l[2]` since `l[3]` is 3.
