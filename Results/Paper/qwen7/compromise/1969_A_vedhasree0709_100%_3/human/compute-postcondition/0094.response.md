Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code snippet `j = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `j`. Since `i` was initially 1 and `p` and `q` were initialized from `l[1]` and `l[0]` respectively, these values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being 1, `j` being 1, `p` being `l[1]`, and `q` being `l[0]`. However, since only `j` is affected, the output focuses on updating `j` while keeping `i` as its initial value.
