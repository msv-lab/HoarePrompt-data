Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `p` is `l[2]`, `q` is `l[1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. The values of `i`, `j`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged, and the `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional block if one was present.
