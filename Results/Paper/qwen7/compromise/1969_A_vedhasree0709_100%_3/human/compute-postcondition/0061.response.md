Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= n - 1`.
2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
4. **Determine the requirement for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Given that `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 3. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that `i <= n - 1` remains true for the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3; `p` is `l[2]`; `q` is `l[1]`; `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
