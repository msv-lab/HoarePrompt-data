Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the logic for determining the maximum number of wins for the specified cow. Here’s why:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic Flaws**:
   - The function `func_1` tries to find the first two positions where the cow's rating is less than the ratings of other cows. This approach is flawed because it doesn't consider the optimal swapping strategy.
   - The function should identify the best position to swap the cow to maximize its wins.

2. **Swapping Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy involves finding the best position to place the cow such that it can win as many matches as possible. This requires identifying the highest-rated cow that is lower than the specified cow's rating and placing the cow before this higher-rated cow.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify the highest-rated cow that is lower than the specified cow's rating.
   - Determine the position of this cow.
   - Calculate the number of wins based on the position of the specified cow relative to this higher-rated cow.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    max_wins = 0
    # Find the highest-rated cow that is lower than the specified cow's rating
    for i in range(n):
        if l[i] > l[k]:
            max_wins = max(max_wins, i + 1)
    # If the specified cow is already in the best position
    max_wins = max(max_wins, k + 1)
    # If the specified cow can be swapped to win more matches
    for i in range(n):
        if l[i] > l[k]:
            if i < k:
                max_wins = max(max_wins, k - i)
            else:
                max_wins = max(max_wins, i - k)
    print(max_wins)
```

This corrected version identifies the best position to place the cow and calculates the maximum number of wins accordingly.
