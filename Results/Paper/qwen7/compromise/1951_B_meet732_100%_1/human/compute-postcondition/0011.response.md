Postcondition: `ind` is a list containing exactly one index from the list `a` where the corresponding cow rating is greater than `x`. `a` is the original list of n distinct integers. `c` is the number of elements added to `ind` (at least 1). The current value of `len(ind)` is 1, and the first element of `ind` is 0. `x` is the k-th element of the list `a`.
