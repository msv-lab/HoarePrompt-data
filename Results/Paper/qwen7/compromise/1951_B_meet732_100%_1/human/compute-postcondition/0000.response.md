Output State: **a is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and 1 <= k <= n; x is the k-th element of the list a.**

Explanation: The code `x = a[k]` assigns the value of the k-th element in the list `a` to the variable `x`. The length of the list `a` is `n`, and `k` is an index between 1 and `n` (inclusive). The other variables and the list `a` remain unchanged.
