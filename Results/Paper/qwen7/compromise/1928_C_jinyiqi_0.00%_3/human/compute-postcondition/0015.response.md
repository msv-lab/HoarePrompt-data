Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 5, `output1` is a list containing the values [3, 5], `output2` is a list containing the value [int(x / 5)] if `x` is divisible by 5, otherwise `output2` remains an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends `int(x / i)` to `output2`, where `i` is 5. Since `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), the value of `int(x / 5)` depends on whether `x` is divisible by 5. If `x` is divisible by 5, `output2` will contain `[int(x / 5)]`. Otherwise, `output2` remains an empty list. The other variables (`x`, `i`, `output1`) remain unchanged.
