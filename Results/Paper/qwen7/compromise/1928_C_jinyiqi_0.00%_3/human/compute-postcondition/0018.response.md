Output State: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` from 1 up to `int(x ** 0.5)`, and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding quotients of `x` divided by each divisor in `output1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be set to the next integer greater than the square root of `x`. The lists `output1` and `output2` will contain all pairs of divisors of `x` (including the divisor 1 and `x` itself if `x` is a perfect square). Specifically, `output1` will have all integers `i` such that \(1 \leq i \leq \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor\) and `x % i == 0\), and `output2` will have the corresponding values `int(x / i)` for each `i` in `output1`.
