Output State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 3, `output1` is a list containing the values [3], and `output2` is an empty list.**

The code appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `output1`. Therefore, `output1` now contains the values [1, 3]. The value of `x`, `i`, and `output2` remain unchanged.
