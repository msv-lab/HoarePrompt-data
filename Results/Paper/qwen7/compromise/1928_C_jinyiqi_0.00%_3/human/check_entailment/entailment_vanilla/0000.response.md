Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - It reads the position `n` and the number `x` for each test case.

2. **Checking Conditions for Valid `k`:**
   - The program checks two conditions to determine possible values of `k`:
     1. `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     2. `(n - x) % 2 == 0`

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It returns a list of divisors in ascending order.

4. **Generating Possible Values of `k`:**
   - For each valid condition, it uses the divisors from `func_1` to generate possible values of `k`.
   - Specifically, it checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` for each divisor `s`.

5. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - The results are stored in a set to remove duplicates before converting back to a list.

### Detailed Check:

1. **Condition Checking:**
   - The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` ensure that `k` is an integer and fits the pattern described in the problem.
   - These conditions are correctly applied.

2. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates all divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
   - The logic to reverse and concatenate divisors is correct.

3. **Generating `k` Values:**
   - The logic to check if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the generated `k` values satisfy the problem constraints.
   - This part of the logic is also correct.

4. **Output Handling:**
   - The final output is a unique list of valid `k` values, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find all valid `k` values based on the given constraints. There are no logical errors or omissions in the provided code.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
