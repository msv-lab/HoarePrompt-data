Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function `func_1` computes the divisors of `x` and returns them in a specific order. It correctly handles the divisors of `x` by including both the smaller and larger divisors (if they are distinct) in a concatenated list, with the larger ones appearing before the smaller ones.
   - The logic for finding divisors is sound, and the function correctly handles the square root calculation to ensure efficiency.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks two conditions for each test case:
     1. `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     2. `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
   - These conditions ensure that the settling pattern fits within the range defined by `n` and `x`.
   - For each condition, it calls `func_1` on the appropriate value (`n + x - 2` or `n - x`) and then iterates over the returned divisors to check if they satisfy the condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - The results are stored in a set to avoid duplicates and then converted to a list before printing.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `k = 1` is not considered, as the settling does not exist for `k = 1`.
   - The program correctly handles large inputs within the specified range (`1 <= x < n <= 10^9`).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
