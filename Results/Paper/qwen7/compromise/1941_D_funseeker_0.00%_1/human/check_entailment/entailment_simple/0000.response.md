Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are correctly defined and handle the input as expected.
   - `func_1` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2` calls `func_1` and returns the integer value.
   - `func_3` calls `func_1` and splits the resulting string into integers.
   - `func_4` correctly initializes the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`. It also initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Possible Final Players**:
   - The logic inside `func_4` iterates through each throw, updating the set `ans` based on the direction of the throw (`c`).
   - For each player `q` in `ans`, it calculates the new positions considering both clockwise (`(q + r) % n`) and counterclockwise (`(q - r) % n`) movements.
   - If the direction is unknown (`c == '?'`), both possible positions are considered.
   - After processing all throws, the set `ans` contains all possible final positions of the ball.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where `0` is in `ans` by replacing `0` with `n` using `ans.discard(0)` and `ans.add(n)`.
   - The final output is the size of `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` in sorted order.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the logic in `func_4` correctly implements the required functionality without any logical errors or omissions.

Correctness: **True**
