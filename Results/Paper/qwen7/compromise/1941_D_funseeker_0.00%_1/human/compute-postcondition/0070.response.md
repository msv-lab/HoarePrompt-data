Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one element, `temp` is a set containing one element `(q + r) % n`, `r` is an integer value converted from the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and is either '0' or '?'**.

Explanation: The code adds an element to the set `temp`. The element added is `(q + r) % n`. The values of `q`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. `ans` is still required to contain at least one element, and `temp` now contains the new element `(q + r) % n`.
