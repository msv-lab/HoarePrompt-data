Output State: **If `c` is '1', then `temp` contains the elements `[temp, (q + r) % n]`; if `c` is '0' or '?', then `temp` contains the elements `[temp, (q + r) % n]`; if `c` is neither '1', '0', nor '?', then `temp` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- If `c` was '1', then `temp` originally contained `(q - r) % n`.
- After executing `temp.add((q + r) % n)`, `temp` now contains both `(q - r) % n` and `(q + r) % n`.
- If `c` was '0' or '?', then `temp` originally contained an additional element `(q + r) % n`.
- After executing `temp.add((q + r) % n)`, `temp` now contains two elements `(q + r) % n`.
- If `c` was neither '1', '0', nor '?', then `temp` remained unchanged, and adding `(q + r) % n` to it would not affect its contents.
