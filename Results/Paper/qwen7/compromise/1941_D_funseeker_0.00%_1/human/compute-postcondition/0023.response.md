Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for q in ans:`. The variables involved here are `q` and `ans`.

2. **Understand the Postconditions**:
   - `ans` must contain at least one element.
   - `q` is the next element from `ans`.
   - `temp` contains an element equal to `(q + r) % n` if `c` is either '0' or '?'.
   - `temp` stays unchanged if `c` is neither '1' nor '?'.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `q` is the next element from `ans`, it means that `q` is being processed in the loop body.
   - After processing `q`, the loop will move on to the next element in `ans`.
   - Therefore, `ans` will lose its first element (which was `q`), and `q` will change to the next element in `ans`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `ans` will now contain all elements except the first one (the one that was `q`).
   - `q` will be the next element in `ans`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ans` will no longer contain the first element, which was `q`.
- `q` will be the next element in `ans`.

So, the updated state is:

**`ans` must contain at least one element (excluding the first element, which was `q`), `q` is the next element from `ans`, and `temp` contains an element equal to `(q + r) % n` if `c` is either '0' or '?', and `temp` stays unchanged if `c` is neither '1' nor '?'**.

State: **`ans` must contain at least one element (excluding the first element, which was `q`), `q` is the next element from `ans`, and `temp` contains an element equal to `(q + r) % n` if `c` is either '0' or '?', and `temp` stays unchanged if `c` is neither '1' nor '?'**.
