Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is equal to `temp`, `r` is an integer value converted from the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
for q in ans:
    if c == '0' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q + r) % n)
    if c == '1' or c == '?':
        temp.add((q - r) % n)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element, and `temp` is a set containing two elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `r` is an integer value converted from the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()` and is either '0' or '?', because `c` is either '1' or '?' as per the if condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the next element in `ans`, `temp` contains four elements: `(q + r) % n`, `(q - r) % n`, and the original elements from before the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` must contain at least one element (excluding the current `q`), `q` is the next element in `ans`, and `temp` contains six elements: `(q + r) % n`, the original elements from before the if-else block, `(q + r) % n`, and `(q - r) % n`. This is because if `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is updated to include an additional element `(q + r) % n`, and since there is no else part, this update remains regardless of the condition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
