Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000); `m` is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000); `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 <= x <= n); `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the set `ans` with the player `x`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial values, which are assigned by `func_3()`. The set `ans` now contains only the player `x`.
