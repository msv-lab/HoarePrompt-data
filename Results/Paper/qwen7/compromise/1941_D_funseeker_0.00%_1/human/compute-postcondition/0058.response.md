Output State: **`temp` is a list containing the element `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation: The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the element `(q - r) % n` to the list `temp`. Since the initial state of `temp` is a list, and depending on the value of `c`, the list might already contain certain elements, but after executing this line of code, the list `temp` will definitely contain the element `(q - r) % n`. The other conditions related to `c` do not affect the direct addition of this element. Therefore, the updated state of `temp` is a list containing this new element.
