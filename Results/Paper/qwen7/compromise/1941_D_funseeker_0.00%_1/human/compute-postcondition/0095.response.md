Postcondition: **The final state of `ans` will be a set containing up to six unique elements after all iterations of the loop have finished. These elements are derived from applying the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to the initial player `x` and any subsequent players added to `ans` based on the values of `r` and `c` obtained from `func_1().split()` in each iteration. The current value of `0` is present in the set `ans`.**
