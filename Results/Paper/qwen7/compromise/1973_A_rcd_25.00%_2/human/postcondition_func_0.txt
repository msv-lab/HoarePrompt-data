The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three non-negative integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) under specific constraints. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on these integers. If the sum of \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is odd, it prints \(-1\) and moves to the next test case. Otherwise, it determines a specific value to print according to certain conditions involving \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\). After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated values for each case.
