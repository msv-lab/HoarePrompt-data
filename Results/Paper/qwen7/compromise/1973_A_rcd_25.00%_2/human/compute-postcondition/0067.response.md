Let's analyze the given conditions and the loop head to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Given Conditions:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`.

### Loop Head:
```python
while high >= cur:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition is `high >= cur`.
- For the loop to continue executing, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

### Current States:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`.
- `cur` is some value that needs to be incremented or checked against `high`.

### Determining the Next State:
- The loop will continue as long as `high >= cur`.
- To ensure the loop executes one more time, `cur` must be less than `high`.

### Conclusion:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `cur`. It must be less than `high`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`, and `cur` must be less than `high`.**

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`, and `cur` must be less than `high`.**
