Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `p1, p2, p3` are updated to their respective integer inputs.**

The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. The initial conditions regarding `t` and the relationship between `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` as well as the unchanged values of `t`.
