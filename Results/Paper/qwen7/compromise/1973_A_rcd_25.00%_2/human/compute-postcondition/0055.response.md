Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low`, and `(p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur))` is true, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or altered by the `break` statement, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `low`, `high`, and `cur` remain as they were before the statement was executed. The condition `(p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur))` also remains true.
