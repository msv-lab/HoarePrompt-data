Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even, and `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, `low` is `p3 - p1` if `p3 - p1` is smaller than `p3 - p2`, otherwise `low` is `p3 - p2`, `high` is the opposite of `low`, `cur` is equal to `low`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `low` to `cur`. Since `low` was previously defined based on the conditions given, `cur` now holds the same value as `low`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
