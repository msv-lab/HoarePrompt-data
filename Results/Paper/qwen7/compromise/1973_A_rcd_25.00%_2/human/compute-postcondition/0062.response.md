Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers assigned values from the input split by spaces.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` must be greater than or equal to `low + 1`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression to evaluate is `p1 - cur + p3`.

3. **Identify Missing Variable:**
   - The variable `cur` is not defined in the initial state. Since it is not defined, we cannot determine its value directly from the given information. However, if we assume `cur` is a typo and should be one of the variables `p1`, `p2`, or `p3`, we need to consider the context and typical usage.

4. **Typical Usage Context:**
   - Given the context of the problem, `cur` might be intended to be `p1` or `p2`. Let's assume `cur` is meant to be `p1` (a common usage in such problems).

5. **Evaluate the Expression:**
   - If `cur` is assumed to be `p1`, then the expression becomes `p1 - p1 + p3`, which simplifies to `p3`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The code will print the value of `p3`.

Output: **p3**
