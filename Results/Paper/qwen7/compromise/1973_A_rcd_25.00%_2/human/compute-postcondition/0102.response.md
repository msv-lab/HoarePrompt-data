To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head condition and the variables involved in it.

The loop condition is `high >= cur`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- Either `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is true, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `cur` is equal to `high` + 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `high >= cur` must still be true. Given the current state, `cur` is equal to `high` + 1, which means the condition `high >= cur` is false.

To make the loop execute one more time, `cur` must be less than `high`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `cur` to be less than `high`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is less than `high`**.
