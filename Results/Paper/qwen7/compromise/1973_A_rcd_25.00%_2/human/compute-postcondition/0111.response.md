Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, and the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` reflect the inputs provided for each iteration.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` will be decremented by the number of times the loop ran. Since `t` starts as an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, after running the loop for all its iterations, `t` will be reduced to 0. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be the last set of values provided by the input for the final iteration of the loop. The loop's logic does not change these values; it only prints certain outcomes based on the conditions given. Therefore, the final state of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be those provided in the last input, and `t` will be 0.
