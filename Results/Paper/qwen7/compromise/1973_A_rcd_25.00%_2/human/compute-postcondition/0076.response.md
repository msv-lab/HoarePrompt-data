Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd and `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program continues the loop. If the sum is even or `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is equal to `high`.
