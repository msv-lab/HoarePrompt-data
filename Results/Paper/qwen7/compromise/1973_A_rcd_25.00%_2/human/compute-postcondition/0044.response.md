Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
- `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are then updated to their respective integer inputs.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This print statement simply outputs the integer `-1`. The values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` do not affect this specific print statement.

Output: **-1**
