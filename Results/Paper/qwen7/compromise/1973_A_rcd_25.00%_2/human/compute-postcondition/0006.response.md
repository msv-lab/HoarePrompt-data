Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement itself, the values of `t`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` remain unchanged, and the condition about their sum being odd also remains valid.
