Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `high >= cur`. Therefore, the relevant variables are `high` and `cur`.

2. **Understand the current state**:
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive.
   - `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned from the input split.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is equal to `low`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `high >= cur` must be true.
   - Since `cur` is equal to `low`, the condition simplifies to `high >= low`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - By definition, `high` is always greater than or equal to `low`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is the minimum of the same two values, the condition `high >= cur` is always true based on the definitions of `high` and `cur`.

Since the condition `high >= cur` is always true given the definitions of `high` and `cur`, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop executes the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low`**
