Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head condition is `high >= cur`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is equal to `low`, and `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

3. **Analyze the condition `high >= cur`**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.

4. **Check the relationship between `high` and `cur`**:
   - Since `cur` is equal to `low`, and `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is at most the smaller of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, so `high` is at least the larger of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

5. **Determine if any adjustments are needed**:
   - Given that `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` will always be greater than or equal to `cur` unless both `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are zero, making both `low` and `cur` zero, and `high` also zero.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - In the given conditions, `high` being greater than or equal to `cur` is inherently true as long as `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2` are not both zero. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time based on the given conditions.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `p1`, `p2`, `p3` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `cur` is equal to `low`**
