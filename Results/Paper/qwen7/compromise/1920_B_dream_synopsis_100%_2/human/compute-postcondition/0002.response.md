Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `n`, `k`, and `x` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state as they are not affected by this operation.
