Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list containing the element `a[0]`, `sums` is `a[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Initially, `sums` is equal to `a[0]`. After appending, `ans` becomes a list containing `a[0]`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `sums` remain unchanged.
