Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Here, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` remains an integer, `n` remains an integer, and `ans` still contains the value of `sums`, which is now updated according to the given formula.
