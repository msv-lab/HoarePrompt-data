Output State: **`i` is within the range [0, k]; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; `ans` is an empty list; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and reversed; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `i` is not equal to 0; and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**

This means that the value of `sums` has been updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. All other variables remain in their original conditions or values as described in the initial state.
