Postcondition: `i` is an integer and not equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` contains the value of `sums`, and `sums` is updated as follows:
- If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`.
- If `i + x - 1 >= n`, then `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]`.
