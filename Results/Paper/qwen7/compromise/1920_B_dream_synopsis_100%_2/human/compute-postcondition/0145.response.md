Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), along with an array of \( n \) integers. It sorts the array in descending order, calculates a series of sums based on specific conditions involving \( x \) and \( k \), and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints the maximum value from this list for each test case.**
