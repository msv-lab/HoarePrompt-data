Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop, and `ans` will be a list containing `k+1` elements.**

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have reached the value of `k`. The variable `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `sums` will hold the final value after all the updates specified in the loop body. The list `ans` will contain `k+1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` at the end of each iteration of the loop.
