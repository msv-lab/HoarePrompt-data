Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is the same as before, `sums` is `a[1]`, and `ans` is a list containing `[sums, sums]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains `[sums]`, which is `[a[1]]`. After appending `sums` again, `ans` becomes `[a[1], a[1]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
