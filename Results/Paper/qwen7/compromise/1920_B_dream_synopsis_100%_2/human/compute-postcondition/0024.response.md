Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans` is a list containing `sums`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was not initialized before this line, it becomes a list containing the single element `sums`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `sums` remain unchanged.
