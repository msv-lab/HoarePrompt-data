Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list. If `i == 0`, then `ans` contains the value of `sums` updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` contains the value of `sums` updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, then `ans` contains the value of `sums` updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
