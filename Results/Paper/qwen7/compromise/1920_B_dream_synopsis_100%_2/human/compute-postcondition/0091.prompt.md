Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `k + 1`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated, `ans` is now an empty list, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and reversed, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is within the range [0, k], `sums` is updated to either `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` (if `i + x - 1 < n`) or `sums + a[i - 1]` (if `i + x - 1 >= n`), `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and reversed, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is within the range `[0, k-1]`, `sums` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i == 0`, `sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `ans` now includes the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` includes the new value of `sums`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` includes the old value of `sums`. `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration, and `a` and `sum1` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is within the range [1, k], `sums` is updated as follows: if `i == 0`, then `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]`. `ans` includes the updated value of `sums`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same, and `a` and `sum1` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
