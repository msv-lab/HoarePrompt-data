Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is the same as before, `sums` is either `a[1]` or updated to `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` depending on whether the condition `i + x - 1 < n` is met. If the condition is true, `ans` is a list containing `[sums]`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged and is appended with `sums`.
