Output State: **`i` is within the range [0, k]; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`; `ans` is an empty list; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and reversed; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `i` is not equal to 0; `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding the element `a[i - 1]` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions involving `i`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` remain the same as before the code execution.
