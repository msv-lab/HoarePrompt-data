Output State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `i` is `k + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` is calculated based on the conditions within the loop:

- If `i == 0`, the first element in `ans` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For subsequent iterations where `i + x - 1 < n`, each element in `ans` is updated to the previous value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`.
- For iterations where `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, each element in `ans` is updated to the previous value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]`.

The final state of `sums` will be the last value it was updated to, which is the last element in the `ans` list.
