Output State: **`i` is within the range [1, k], `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value, `ans` includes the updated value of `sums` in the list, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same, and `a` and `sum1` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The other variables (`i`, `sums`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
