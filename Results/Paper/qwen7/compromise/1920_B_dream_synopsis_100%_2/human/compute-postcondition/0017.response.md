Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is not equal to 0, and (i + x - 1 >= n); `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`; `ans` now contains `[sums]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` was previously updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`, the new value of `ans` is a list containing `[sums]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
