Output State: **`ans` now contains the value of `sums`, `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`, `i` is an integer and not equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer and the condition `i + x - 1 < n` is still true.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `sums`, `i`, `x`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition `i + x - 1 < n` is still true.
