Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b`, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `len(a)` is 0, then `x` and `y` are both set to infinity. If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, then `i` is incremented by 1 (making it equal to the length of list `b` + 1), and `y` is updated to the last element of list `b` with an additional element from `lit[i]`. Otherwise, `x` and `y` are updated to `lit[i]` if `lit[i]` is greater than `x` and also greater than `y`. If none of these conditions are met, `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
