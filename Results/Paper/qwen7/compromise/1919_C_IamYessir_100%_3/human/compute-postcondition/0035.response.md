Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with the last element being `lit[i]`, `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty).**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Since `i` was previously 0, `lit[i]` is `lit[0]`. The value of `x` is updated to be the last element of the updated list `a`, which is now `lit[0]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
