Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is either an empty list with `x` being infinity or a non-empty list where `x` is the last element of `a`, and `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty). The current value of `x` is greater than `lit[0]`, and the condition `x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y` is satisfied.
