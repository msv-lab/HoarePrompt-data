Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`, `y` is unchanged, `b` and `lit` are unchanged, `x` is set to infinity (float('inf')).**

In this case, the code sets `x` to infinity (`float('inf')`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
