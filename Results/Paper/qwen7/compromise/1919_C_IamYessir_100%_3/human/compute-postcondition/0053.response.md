Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with the last element being `lit[0]`, `y` is either infinity (if `b` is empty) or the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty), and `x` is less than `y`, and the condition `x >= lit[i]` is true.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. Given that `i` is 0, the first element of `lit` is appended to `a`, making the last element of `a` equal to `lit[0]`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
