Postcondition: `i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If the last element of list `b` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, then `y` remains unchanged as the last element of list `b`. Otherwise, `y` is updated to `lit[i]` and list `a` gains a new element equal to `lit[i]`, provided that `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `y`.
