Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list with one more element than before (the last element is `lit[i]`), `b` is unchanged, `cp` remains 0, if `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` is set to positive infinity, and `y` is either the last element of list `b` or positive infinity.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `a`. This increases the length of `a` by one, with the new last element being `lit[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
