Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is either an empty list or a list with one element, `b` is a list with at least one additional element which is `lit[i]`, `cp` is 0, `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and the value of `x` is less than the current value of `y`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `b` had at least zero elements before the append operation, after appending, `b` will have at least one additional element, which is `lit[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
