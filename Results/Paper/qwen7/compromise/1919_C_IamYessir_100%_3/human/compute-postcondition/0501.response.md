Output State: **`i` is 1; `b` must have at least one element, and the current value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`; `s` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is incremented by 1, starting from its initial value of 0 (implied since it's not given explicitly but derived from the context). The values of `i` and `b` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
