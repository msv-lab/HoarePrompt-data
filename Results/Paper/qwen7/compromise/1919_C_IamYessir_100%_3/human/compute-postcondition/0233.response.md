Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. The last element of list `a` is appended to list `a`, `y` is strictly greater than the last element of list `b`, `x` is not greater than `y`, and the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than `y`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to list `a`. Since `i` is already equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, appending an element to `a` does not affect `i`, `n`, or `x`. The conditions regarding `y` and `x` remain unchanged as well.
