Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. If `len(a)` is 0, then `x` is set to infinity and `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged and `y` is equal to the last element of list `b`, and list `b` has an additional element `lit[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. This increases the length of `b` by 1, so `i` is now one more than the original length of `b`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
