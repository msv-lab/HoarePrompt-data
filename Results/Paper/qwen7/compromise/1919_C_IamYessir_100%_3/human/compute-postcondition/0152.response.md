Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `a`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < len(a)`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `len(a)` is greater than 1.
   - `s` is 1 (though `s` is not directly involved in the loop head).

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 at the beginning of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The condition `len(a) > 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `len(a)` must still be greater than 1.
   - `s` remains unchanged and is still 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `len(a)` is greater than 1, and `s` is 1**.
