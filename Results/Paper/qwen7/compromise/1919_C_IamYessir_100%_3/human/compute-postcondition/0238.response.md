Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, `n` must be at least 1, and `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`. `y` is less than or equal to the last element of list `b`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. Additionally, `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is now equal to the last element of list `b`; `b` has the last element of `lit` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `i` is already equal to the length of list `b` minus 1, appending `lit[i]` to `b` increases the length of `b` by 1, making `i` equal to the new length of `b` minus 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
