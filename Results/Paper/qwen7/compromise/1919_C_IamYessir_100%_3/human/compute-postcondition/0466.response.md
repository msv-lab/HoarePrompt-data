Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` now contains an additional element which is the integer corresponding to `lit[i]`, `b` now contains an additional element which is the integer corresponding to `lit[i+1] if y >= lit[i+1]`, otherwise `b` now contains an additional element which is equal to `lit[i+1] if y >= lit[i+1] and lit[i+1] > x`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, `cp` remains 0, if `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` is set to positive infinity.**

This means that the list `a` has been updated to include the new element `lit[i]`. The list `b` has also been updated based on the conditions involving `y` and `lit[i+1]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their previous postconditions.
