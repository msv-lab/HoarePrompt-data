Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is either infinity or the last element of list `a`, depending on whether the list `a` is empty or not, and `y` is either infinity or the last element of list `b`, depending on whether list `b` is empty or not. If `y >= lit[i]`, then `b` is a list containing the element from `a` at index `i-1`. Otherwise, if `lit[i] > x`, then `b` contains the element from list `a` at index `i-1`; otherwise, list `a` now contains the element `a[1]` and list `b` remains unchanged.
