Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer input from the user, `lit` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `lit` remain unchanged from their initial state.
