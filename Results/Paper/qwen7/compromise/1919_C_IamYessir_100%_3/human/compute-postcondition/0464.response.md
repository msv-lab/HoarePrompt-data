Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i+2]` relative to `x` and `y`, `cp` remains 0, if `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` is set to positive infinity, `b` now contains one additional element which is the integer corresponding to `lit[i+1]` if `y >= lit[i+1]`, otherwise `b` now contains an additional element which is equal to `lit[i+1]` if `y >= lit[i+1] and lit[i+1] > x`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, `y` is either positive infinity or the last element of list `b`.

This postcondition describes that after executing the if-else block, `n` remains greater than 0, `lit` remains a list of integers, and the states of `a` and `b` are updated based on the value of `lit[i]` relative to `x` and `y`. Specifically, if `lit[i] > x`, then `a` and `b` are updated as specified in the if part. Otherwise, `b` is updated based on the value of `lit[i+1]` relative to `y` and `x`, and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
