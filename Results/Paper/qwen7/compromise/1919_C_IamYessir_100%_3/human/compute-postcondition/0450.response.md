Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i+1]` relative to `x` and `y`.
   - `cp` remains 0.
   - If `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`.
   - Otherwise, `y` is positive infinity.
   - If `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`.
   - `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` is set to positive infinity.
   - `b` now contains an additional element which is the integer corresponding to `lit[i]` if `y >= lit[i]`, otherwise `b`'s state depends on whether `x < y` and `x >= lit[i]` or `y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one less than the current `i` in the loop.
   - We need to determine the new state of `i`, `n`, `lit`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` for the next iteration.

Given the loop condition `for i in range(0, n):`, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n-1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Increment `i`:**
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

2. **Check `n`:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

3. **Update `lit`:**
   - `lit` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

4. **Update `a` and `b`:**
   - Based on the conditions given, we need to update `a` and `b` based on the value of `lit[i+1]` relative to `x` and `y`.

5. **Update `x` and `y`:**
   - The values of `x` and `y` depend on the state of `b` and the relationship between `x`, `y`, and `lit[i+1]`.

### Updated States:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `lit` remains the same.
- `a` and `b` will be updated based on the value of `lit[i+1]` relative to `x` and `y`.
- `x` and `y` will be updated based on the state of `b` and the relationship between `x`, `y`, and `lit[i+1]`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` are lists whose states depend on the value of `lit[i+2]` relative to `x` and `y`, `cp` remains 0, if `b` is not empty, `x` is greater than `y`, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, if `x` is equal to `y`, then `x` remains equal to `y`, `x` is equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` is set to positive infinity, and `b` now contains an additional element which is the integer corresponding to `lit[i+1]` if `y >= lit[i+1]`, otherwise `b`'s state depends on whether `x < y` and `x >= lit[i+1]` or `y >= lit[i+1] and lit[i+1] > x`. If `x < y` and `x >= lit[i+1]`, `a` is a list with one more element than before (the last element is `lit[i+1]`), and `b`'s state depends on the value of `lit[i+2]` relative to `x` and `y`. Otherwise, `b` now contains an additional element which is equal to `lit[i+1]` if `y >= lit[i+1] and lit[i+1] > x`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged.**
