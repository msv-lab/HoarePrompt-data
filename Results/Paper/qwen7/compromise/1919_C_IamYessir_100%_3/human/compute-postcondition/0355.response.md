Output State: **`n` is an input integer decremented by 1, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `a` and `b`. The values of `n` and `lit` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `n` is still an input integer decremented by 1, and `lit` is still a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers.
