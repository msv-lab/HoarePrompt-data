Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is either an empty list or a list with one element, `b` is a list with at least one more element (the appended element is `lit[i]`), `cp` is 0, and `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and there exists an index `i` such that `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]` and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Since `b` was previously a list with at least zero elements, after appending `lit[i]`, `b` now has at least one more element. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
