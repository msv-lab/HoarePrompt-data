Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` contains the element `lit[3]`, `b` is unchanged, `x` is the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, otherwise `x` is infinity.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the value of `lit[i]` (where `i` is 3) to the list `a`. Since `i` is 3, `a` now contains the element `lit[3]`. The value of `n` remains greater than 0. The list `b` is not affected, so it remains as it was. The value of `x` is updated to be the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty, which it is now, or infinity if `a` was empty, which it is not.
