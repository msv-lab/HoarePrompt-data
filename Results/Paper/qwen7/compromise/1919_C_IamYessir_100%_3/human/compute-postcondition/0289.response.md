Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b` + 1, `n` must be at least 1, `x` is either set to infinity (float('inf')) or reassigned to the last element of list `a`, `y` is float('inf'), and `b` and `lit` are unchanged.**

The code assigns `float('inf')` to `y`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
