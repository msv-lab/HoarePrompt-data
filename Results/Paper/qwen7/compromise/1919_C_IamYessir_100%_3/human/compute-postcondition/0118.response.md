Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, the list `b` now contains the element `lit[3]`, the list `a` is unchanged, and if the list `a` is empty, `x` is infinity, otherwise `x` is the last element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element `lit[i]` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 3, `b` now contains the element `lit[3]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, `n` remains greater than 0, and the list `a` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `x` remains as defined by the initial state, which means if `a` is empty, `x` is infinity, otherwise `x` is the last element of list `a`.
