Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is a list with one more element than before, `b` is a list with at least zero elements, `cp` is 0, `y` is the last element of the list `b` if `b` is not empty, otherwise `y` is positive infinity, and `x` is equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the `i-th` element of the list `lit` to the list `a`. Since `a` was either an empty list or a list with one element, after appending the `i-th` element of `lit`, `a` will now be a list with one more element than before. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.
