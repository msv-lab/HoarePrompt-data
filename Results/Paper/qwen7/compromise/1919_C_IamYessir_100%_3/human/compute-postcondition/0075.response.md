Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, and the loop condition is `i < n`, the loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 0.
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
