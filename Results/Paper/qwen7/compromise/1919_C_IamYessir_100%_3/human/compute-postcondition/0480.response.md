Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `n` will be 0, `lit` will remain as the list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` and `b` will be lists whose final states depend on the values of `lit` relative to `x` and `y` throughout the iterations. `cp` will remain 0. If `b` is not empty, `x` will be greater than `y`, otherwise `y` will be positive infinity. `x` will be equal to the last element of list `a` if `len(a) != 0`, otherwise `x` will be set to positive infinity. `b` will contain all elements of `lit` that satisfy the conditions specified within the loop.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `n` will be 0 because the loop runs from 0 to `n-1`.
- The list `lit` will stay the same as it was initially.
- The lists `a` and `b` will each contain specific elements from `lit` based on the comparisons made during the loop.
- The variable `cp` will remain unchanged at 0.
- The value of `x` will be the last element of `a` if `a` is not empty; otherwise, it will be positive infinity.
- The value of `y` will be the last element of `b` if `b` is not empty; otherwise, it will be positive infinity.
- Both `a` and `b` will collectively contain all elements from `lit` that meet the specified conditions within the loop.
