Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `b`; `n` must be at least 1; `x` is equal to the last element of list `a`; `a` has its last element appended with the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the end of list `a`. Since `i` is equal to the length of list `b`, the value being appended is `b[i]`. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged as per the precondition.
