Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it divides the list into two sublists, \( a \) and \( b \), based on certain conditions. It then counts the number of times an element in sublist \( b \) is greater than the previous element. The function prints this count for each test case.**
