Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(b) - 1` (since `i` starts at `1` and goes up to but does not include `len(b)`).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `s` is 1

4. **Condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues if `i` is less than `len(b)`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `s` remains unchanged as per the postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `s` is 1**
