Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `start_year` is the result of applying the operation ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for each x in the range from 0 to len(nums) - 1, with x taking on each value in that range in sequence, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial state of `num_tests` and the calculation of `start_year` remain unchanged. Therefore, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, and `start_year` is calculated as specified, and `n` is now an input integer.
