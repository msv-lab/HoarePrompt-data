The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. For the loop to execute at least once, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num_tests} \leq 1000\). This means `num_tests` is already within the valid range, and no adjustment is necessary since the loop condition `num_tests > 0` is already satisfied.

Therefore, no state adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer, 1 ≤ num_tests ≤ 1000, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.**
