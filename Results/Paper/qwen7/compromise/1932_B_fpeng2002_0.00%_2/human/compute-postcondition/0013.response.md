Output State: `start_year` is the result of applying the operation ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x] for each `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums)` - 1, with `x` taking on each value in that range in sequence, and `x` is `len(nums)` - 1 after all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be the final value obtained by successively applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each index `x` from 0 to the length of the `nums` list minus one. The variable `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list minus one after all iterations have completed.
