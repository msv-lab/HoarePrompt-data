Output State: **`start_year` is ((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `x` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `start_year` based on its current value and the value at index 1 of the `nums` list. The initial value of `start_year` is given by the expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`. After executing the code, `start_year` is recalculated using `nums[x]`, which is `nums[1]` since `x` is 1. The value of `x` remains unchanged.
