Output State: **`x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input, `start_year` is `((((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1])`, and `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`.**

Explanation: 
- The code `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer before storing them in the list `nums`.
- The variable `x` was initially set to the length of the `nums` list, which is now updated to the actual length of the list `nums`.
- The variables `start_year` and `num_tests` remain unchanged from their initial state.
