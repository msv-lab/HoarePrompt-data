Output State: **`num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `start_year` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code sets `start_year` to 0, overriding its previous value which was calculated as the result of a complex operation involving `start_year`, `nums`, and an index `x`. Therefore, `start_year` is now 0, and the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
