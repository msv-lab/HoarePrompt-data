Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `x` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.
   - `x` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `x` in the range from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `x` was 1.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be 2.
   - The value of `len(nums)` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `x` will be 2.
   - `len(nums)` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `start_year` is not directly affected by the loop incrementing `x`, so its value remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`start_year` is ((start_year + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `x` is 2**
