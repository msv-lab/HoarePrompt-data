Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list; `start_year` is ((((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]) + 1) // nums[length of nums - 1] + 1) * nums[length of nums - 1].

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` will be equal to the total number of elements in the `nums` list. The value of `start_year` will be calculated based on the last element of the `nums` list, following the pattern defined within the loop body. Specifically, `start_year` will undergo a series of operations involving division, addition, and multiplication, starting from the initial value of 0 and incorporating each element of `nums` in sequence until the last element is processed.
