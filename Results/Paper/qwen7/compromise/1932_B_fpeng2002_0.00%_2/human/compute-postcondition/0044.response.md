Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, and `start_year` is the result of applying the operation `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each index `x` from 0 to the length of the `nums` list minus one, with `x` being equal to the length of the `nums` list minus one after all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list. The variable `start_year` will hold the final value obtained by successively applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each index `x` from 0 to the length of the `nums` list minus one. This means that `start_year` will undergo a series of updates, each time incorporating the next element in the `nums` list, until all elements have been processed.
