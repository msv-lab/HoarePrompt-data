To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head and the condition under which the loop continues to iterate. The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, `len(nums)`
- `start_year` is calculated as `((((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1])`

Since the loop condition is `num_tests > 0`, the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `num_tests`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

State: **`x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, `len(nums)`, and `start_year` is `((((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1])` and `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
