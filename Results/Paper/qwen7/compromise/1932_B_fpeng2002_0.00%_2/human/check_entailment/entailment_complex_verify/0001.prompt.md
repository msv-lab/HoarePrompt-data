You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    while num_tests > 0:

        n = int(input())

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is equal to the length of the `nums` list, and `start_year` is the result of applying the operation `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each index `x` from 0 to the length of the `nums` list minus one, with `x` being equal to the length of the `nums` list minus one after all iterations.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list. The variable `start_year` will hold the final value obtained by successively applying the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each index `x` from 0 to the length of the `nums` list minus one. This means that `start_year` will undergo a series of updates, each time incorporating the next element in the `nums` list, until all elements have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of integers in a list `a`, and the list `a` itself containing `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a final value for `start_year` by iteratively applying a specific formula to each element in the list `a`. The final value of `start_year` is then printed for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable will be updated to the next occurrence year for each sign.

3. **Loop Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates over each sign.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     ```python
     start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
     ```
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `(start_year + 1) // nums[x]`: This gives the quotient when `(start_year + 1)` is divided by `nums[x]`.
     - Adding 1 to this quotient ensures we get the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the next occurrence year.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs, the final `start_year` is printed.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- `n = 6`
- Periodicities: `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`

1. Start with `start_year = 0`.
2. First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
3. Second sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`.
4. Third sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`.
5. Fourth sign: `start_year = ((8 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`.
6. Fifth sign: `start_year = ((10 + 1) // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`.
7. Sixth sign: `start_year = ((18 + 1) // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`.

The final `start_year` is 36, which matches the expected output.

#### Test Case 2:
- `n = 5`
- Periodicities: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

1. Start with `start_year = 0`.
2. First sign: `start_year = ((0 + 1) // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`.
3. Second sign: `start_year = ((1 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`.
4. Third sign: `start_year = ((2 + 1) // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
5. Fourth sign: `start_year = ((3 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`.
6. Fifth sign: `start_year = ((4 + 1) // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`.

The final `start_year` is 5, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the year when the nth sign occurs and the apocalypse happens. Therefore, the program is correct.
