Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) (where \( 3 \leq n \leq 78 \)), and for each \( n \), it constructs a string \( word \) based on specific rules. It then prints each constructed string. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.**
