You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, alphabet is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', and n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78 after all iterations of the loop. The value of `word` will vary based on the input values for `n` during each iteration, but it will always follow the rules defined within the loop body.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem statement.

2. **Encoding Calculation:**
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the encoded value.
   - The program then constructs a word based on the value of `n`.

3. **Word Construction Logic:**
   - If `n > 52`, it suggests that the word cannot start with 'a' and must use a character beyond 'z'. However, since the maximum possible sum of three lowercase letters is `26 + 26 + 26 = 78`, the condition `n > 52` should be handled correctly.
   - If `n > 26`, it means the first character is 'a', and the second character is calculated as `n - 28`.
   - If `n <= 26`, it means the first two characters are 'a', and the third character is calculated as `n - 3`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly by ensuring that the constructed word is within the valid range of 3 lowercase letters.
   - It ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest by constructing it from the smallest possible characters first.

### Detailed Breakdown of the Code

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            # This condition is not necessary as the maximum sum of three lowercase letters is 78.
            # It should be handled directly in the next conditions.
            pass
        elif n > 26:
            # The first character is 'a', and the second character is calculated as n - 28.
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 27] + 'z'
        else:
            # The first two characters are 'a', and the third character is calculated as n - 3.
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)
```

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `24`
   - Expected Output: `aav`
   - Explanation: `a + a + v = 1 + 1 + 22 = 24`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `70`
   - Expected Output: `rzz`
   - Explanation: `r + z + z = 18 + 26 + 26 = 70`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3`
   - Expected Output: `aaa`
   - Explanation: `a + a + a = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `55`
   - Expected Output: `czz`
   - Explanation: `c + z + z = 3 + 26 + 26 = 55`

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `48`
   - Expected Output: `auz`
   - Explanation: `a + u + z = 1 + 21 + 26 = 48`

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles the construction of the lexicographically smallest word for each test case based on the given encoded values. Therefore, the program is correct.
