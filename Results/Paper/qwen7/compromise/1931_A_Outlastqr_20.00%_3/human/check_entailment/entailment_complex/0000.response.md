Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - The code checks if `n` is greater than 52. If true, it constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`. This is correct because the maximum possible sum for a 3-letter word (where each letter is 'z') is `26 + 26 + 26 = 78`, and the minimum is `3 + 1 + 1 = 5`. So, if `n > 52`, the third letter must be 'z'.
   - The code checks if `n` is greater than 26. If true, it constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`. This is correct because if `n` is between 27 and 52, the second letter must be 'z', and the first letter must be 'a' plus the remaining value.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`. This is correct because if `n` is between 3 and 26, both the first and second letters must be 'a', and the third letter must be the character at the position `n - 3`.

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The logic ensures that the word is constructed in a way that respects lexicographical order. For instance, if `n` is 24, the word "aav" is generated, which is the lexicographically smallest word that can be formed with a sum of 24.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases correctly. For example, for `n = 3`, the word "aaa" is generated, which is the smallest possible word.
   - For `n = 78`, the word "zzz" is generated, which is the largest possible word.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to generate the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
