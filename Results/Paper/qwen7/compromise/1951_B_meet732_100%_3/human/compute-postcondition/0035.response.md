Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It returns one of the following values based on specific conditions: n-1 (where n is the number of distinct integers in the list `a`), k-1 (where k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, indicating the initial position of your cow), the first element in the list `ind` minus 1, the maximum value between k minus the index of the first cow with a rating greater than x or the index of the first cow with a rating greater than x minus 1, the minimum value between the second index in list `ind` decremented by 1 and the index `k` decremented by 1, the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0]), or the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0]).**
