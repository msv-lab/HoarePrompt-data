Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in the `else` block is flawed. Let's consider the following scenario:

- For the test case `(k=2, x=1, a=1)`, the program should output 'YES' because Sasha can always win by betting 1 coin each time and never lose. However, the program incorrectly outputs 'NO' because it checks if `a >= z` where `z` is calculated as `0` in the loop due to the initial value. 

To fix this, the program needs to correctly calculate the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can always win. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if x < k - 1:
            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        elif x == k - 1:
            if a >= x + 3:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can always win
            z = (k - 1) ** (x + 1) - 1
            if a >= z:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that Sasha can always win by calculating the minimum number of coins required to cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then winning.
