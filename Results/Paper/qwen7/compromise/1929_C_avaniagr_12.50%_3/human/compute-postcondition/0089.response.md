Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an integer.
- `x` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `i` is equal to `x + 3`.
- `z` is updated to `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`.
- The condition `a >= z` holds true.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Given this, the output will be a string "YES".

Output: **YES**
