Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is `x + 2`, `z` is `2 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Given the initial state, `z` was already equal to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`. After executing `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`, `z` becomes `2 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
