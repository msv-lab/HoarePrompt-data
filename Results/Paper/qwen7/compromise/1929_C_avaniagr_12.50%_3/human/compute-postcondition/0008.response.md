Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
- `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, and it is assigned a value from the input.
- `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and it is assigned a value from the input. Additionally, the current value of `x` is less than or equal to `k - 2`.
- `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will simply print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
