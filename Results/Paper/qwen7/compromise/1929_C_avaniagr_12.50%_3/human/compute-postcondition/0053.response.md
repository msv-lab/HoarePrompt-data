Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `x` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `x`, `z` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to `z`. Initially, `z` is 0. Since `k` is an input integer, `k - 1` will be a specific integer (let's call it `a`). Therefore, `z // a + 1` will be `0 // a + 1`, which simplifies to `0 + 1`, resulting in `1`. Thus, `z` is updated to `1`. The values of `k`, `x`, `i`, and the initial value of `z` remain unchanged.
