Output State: `k` is an integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is `x + 3`, `z` is `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, `k` remains an integer, `x` remains a non-negative integer, and `a` remains unchanged. The variable `i` will be equal to `x + 3` because it starts at `x` and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `x + 3`. The variable `z` will be updated according to the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` three times. After three iterations, `z` will be `3 * (z + z // (k - 1) + 1)`.
