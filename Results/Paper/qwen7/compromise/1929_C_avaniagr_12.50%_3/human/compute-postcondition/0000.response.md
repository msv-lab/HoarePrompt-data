Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, updating the value of `t`. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
