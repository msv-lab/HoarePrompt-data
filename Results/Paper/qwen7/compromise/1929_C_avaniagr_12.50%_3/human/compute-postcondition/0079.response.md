Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` remains unchanged, `i` equals `x`, `z` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `z = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `z`. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. If `x >= k - 1`, then `i` would have been `x + 1`, but now it is simply `x`. If `x < k - 1`, then `i` would have been `x + 1`, but now it is `x`. In both cases, `z` is now 0.
