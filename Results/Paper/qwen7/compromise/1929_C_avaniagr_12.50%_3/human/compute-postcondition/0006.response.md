Output: **YES**

Explanation: The print statement simply outputs the string "YES". The values of the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` do not affect this print statement because it does not reference any of these variables. The conditions provided for these variables (e.g., `t > 0`, `2 ≤ k ≤ 30`, `1 ≤ x ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9`) are used to define the valid range of values but do not influence the output of the print statement itself.
