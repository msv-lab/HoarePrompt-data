Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30.
- `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100.
- `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9.
- The current value of `x` is equal to `k - 1`.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` because the print statement does not depend on these variables. It only outputs the fixed string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
