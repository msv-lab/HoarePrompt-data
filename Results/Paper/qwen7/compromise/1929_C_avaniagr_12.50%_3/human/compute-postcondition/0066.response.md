Postcondition: `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `2x + 1`, and `z` is equal to `x + 1`. If `x` is equal to `k - 1`, then `z` is updated based on the value of `a` (either `a` remains unchanged if `a >= z` or `a` remains unchanged if `a < z`). Otherwise, `i` is equal to `2x + 1` and `z` is equal to `x + 1`, with `a` remaining unchanged.
