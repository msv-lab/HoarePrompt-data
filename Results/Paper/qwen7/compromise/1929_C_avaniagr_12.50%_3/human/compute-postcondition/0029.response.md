Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `z` is `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates the value of `z` by adding to it the result of `z // (k - 1) + 1`. However, the value of `k` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `z`. We only know that `z` has been updated according to the given formula. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
