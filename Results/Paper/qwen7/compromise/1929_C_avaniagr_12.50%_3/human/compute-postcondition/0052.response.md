Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(x + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `x`.
   - `x` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at `x`, and the loop runs while `i <= x + 1`, the loop will definitely execute at least once if `x` is non-negative.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` is a valid integer (non-negative) to guarantee the loop executes.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `i`.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` is equal to `x`.
- `x` must be a non-negative integer to ensure the loop executes.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`k` is an input integer, `x` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `x`, `z` is 0**
