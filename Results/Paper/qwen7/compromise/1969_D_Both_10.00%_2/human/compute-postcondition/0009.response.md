Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `val_b` from the `main_ar` list.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `val_b`**: Since the loop is iterating over `main_ar`, the initial value of `val_b` should be the first element of `main_ar`.

3. **Understand the Purpose of the Loop**: The loop is intended to process each element of `main_ar`. However, based on the given output state, the loop is actually processing each sub-array in `sec_arr` and accumulating their first elements into `sub_summ`.

4. **Identify the Final State Conditions**:
   - `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements `[val_a[0]]` in `sec_arr`.
   - `sec_arr` is a non-empty list.
   - `val_a` is the last element in `sec_arr`.

5. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `val_b` is the current element being processed in the loop, it should be set to the first element of `main_ar` initially.
   - `sec_arr` must be a non-empty list as stated.
   - `val_a` will be the last sub-array processed in `sec_arr`, so it should be set to the last sub-array in `sec_arr`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly is:

State: **`sub_summ` is 0, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the first element of `main_ar`**.

Note: `sub_summ` is initialized to 0 because it accumulates the sum of the first elements of each sub-array in `sec_arr`.
