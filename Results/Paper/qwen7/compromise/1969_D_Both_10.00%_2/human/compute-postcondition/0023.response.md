Output State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for all `val_b` in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`, and `main_ar` is empty.**

In this final output state, `sub_summ` contains the cumulative sum of the first two elements of each sub-array `val_b` in `main_ar` where the sum of these two elements is greater than or equal to zero. The loop has iterated through all elements in `main_ar`, and since the loop condition checks `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, once all elements are processed, `main_ar` will be empty. `sec_arr` remains a non-empty list, and `val_a` is the last sub-array processed in `sec_arr`.
