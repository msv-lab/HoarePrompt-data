Output State: **`sub_summ'` is now `sub_summ' + val_a[0] + val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list that must have at least one more element, `val_a` is the third element in `sec_arr`**

Explanation: The code `sub_summ += val_a[0]` increments `sub_summ` by the value of `val_a[0]`. Given the initial state where `sub_summ` was `sub_summ' + val_a[0]`, after executing the code, `sub_summ` becomes `sub_summ' + val_a[0] + val_a[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
