Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for val_a in sec_arr:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `val_a` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `sub_summ'` is 0 + `val_a[0]`
   - `sec_arr` is a non-empty list
   - `val_a` is the first element in `sec_arr`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `val_a` must be the next element in `sec_arr`. Since `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, it has at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `sec_arr` remains a non-empty list because the list is not modified within the loop body (only `val_a` changes).
   - `val_a` should now be the second element in `sec_arr` because it was the first element in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `sub_summ'` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop head.
- `sec_arr` remains a non-empty list.
- `val_a` is now the second element in `sec_arr`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`sub_summ'` is 0 + `val_a[0]`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the second element in `sec_arr`**
