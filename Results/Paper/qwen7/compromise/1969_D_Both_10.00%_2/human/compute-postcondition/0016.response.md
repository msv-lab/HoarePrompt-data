Output State: **`sub_summ` is 0 + val_b[0] + val_b[1], `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the next element in `main_ar`**

Explanation: The code updates `sub_summ` by adding the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` to its current value. Since `sub_summ` was initially 0, it now becomes `0 + val_b[0] + val_b[1]`. The other variables (`sec_arr`, `val_a`, and `val_b`) remain unchanged.
