Output State: **The program returns sub_summ, which is the sum of val_b[0] + val_b[1] for all val_b in main_ar where val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0.**

This means that the program returns the calculated `sub_summ`, which is derived from the condition that each pair `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` in `main_ar` must be greater than or equal to 0. The value of `sub_summ` is the sum of all such valid pairs found in `main_ar`.
