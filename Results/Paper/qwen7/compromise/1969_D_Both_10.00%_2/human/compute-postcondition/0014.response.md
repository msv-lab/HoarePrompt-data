Postcondition: `sub_summ` is 0, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`. If the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first two elements of `val_b`. Otherwise, the values of `sub_summ`, `sec_arr`, and `val_a` remain unchanged.
