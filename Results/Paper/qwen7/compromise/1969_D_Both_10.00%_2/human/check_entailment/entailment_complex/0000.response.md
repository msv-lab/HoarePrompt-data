Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes variables for processing each test case. It correctly calls `func_2` to read the values of `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly reads and splits the input into integers and returns them as a map object. However, the use of `map` directly with `int` conversion might not be ideal for list operations, but it works here because the next step is to convert it to a list. The function correctly handles the input for each test case.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function has some issues. The logic inside the function does not align with the problem statement. Specifically:
   - It sums the first elements of `sec_arr`, which is unnecessary.
   - It adds `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ` for all `val_b` in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, which does not match the problem requirements.

Given the problem description, the goal is to maximize Alice's profit considering the constraints and strategies of both players. The current implementation of `func_3` does not reflect the correct logic for calculating Alice's optimal profit.

The core logic for solving this problem involves:
- Sorting items by their difference `(b_i - a_i)` in ascending order.
- Selecting items to maximize Alice's profit under the given constraints.

The current implementation does not follow this logic, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the implementation, we need to implement the logic that correctly maximizes Alice's profit by sorting items and selecting them based on the constraints.
