Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code is flawed and does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Length of Subarray to Remove**: The current code tries to find the minimum length of subarrays where elements are the same but does not account for the specific condition required to make the array non-beautiful. It simply finds the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and incorrectly assumes this is the minimum number of elements to remove.

2. **Handling the Condition for Non-Beautiful Array**: The problem requires checking if it's possible to remove elements such that no two adjacent elements are equal after removal. The current approach does not handle this condition properly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the longest subsequence where elements are the same and ensure that removing these elements would break the beauty condition. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the longest subarray where elements are the same
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ar[i] == ar[i-1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
        
        # Check if the entire array is uniform
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of elements to remove
            min_removals = n - max_length
            print(min_removals)

func()
```

This solution correctly identifies the longest subarray of identical elements and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.
