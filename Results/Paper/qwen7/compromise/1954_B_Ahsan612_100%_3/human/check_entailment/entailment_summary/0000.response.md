Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by finding the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list. However, the logic to determine if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly identify whether the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Instead, it only finds the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number, which does not necessarily lead to the solution.

To determine if the array can be made non-beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no subarray where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` for some `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1). The program should track the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same and ensure that removing elements from these sequences can break the condition for the array to be beautiful.

Given the execution summary and the problem description, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
