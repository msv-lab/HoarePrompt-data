Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful.
2. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
3. The provided code aims to find the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list. This count is used to determine if removing this many elements would make the array non-beautiful.
4. The logic in the code correctly identifies the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the array.
5. If this minimum count is greater than or equal to the length of the array, it means the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing fewer elements, hence the output should be `-1`.
6. Otherwise, the minimum count itself is printed as the result.
7. The code handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
8. The code correctly uses the constraints and input format as described.

Given these points, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
