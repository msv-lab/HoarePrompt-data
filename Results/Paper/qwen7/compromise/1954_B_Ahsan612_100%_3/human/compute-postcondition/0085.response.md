Output State: `same` is a non-negative integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the current element being compared in the list, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, `i` is the index of the next element to be processed in the list.

In this final state, the loop has iterated through the entire list `ar`. The variable `same` will hold the count of consecutive occurrences of the current number `num` before it changes to a new number. The variable `minn` will store the smallest value of `same` found during the loop's execution. The variable `i` will point to the index just beyond the last element of the list `ar`.

The exact values of `same` and `minn` depend on the contents of the list `ar`. `same` will reflect the longest sequence of repeated elements encountered, and `minn` will be the shortest such sequence length observed.
