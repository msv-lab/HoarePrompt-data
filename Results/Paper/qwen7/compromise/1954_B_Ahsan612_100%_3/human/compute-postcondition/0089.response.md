Based on the initial state provided:

- `same` is between 1 and `len(ar) - 1`.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `num` is the last element in `ar` that was different from the previous `num` or `ar[0]` if no such element exists.
- `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop.
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
- The condition `minn == inf` or `minn == len(ar)` holds true.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print(-1)
```

Given the precondition, there is no calculation or evaluation needed for this print statement. It directly prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
