Output State: **`same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is equal to `ar[0]` or `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same` (or 1), `i` is increased by 1, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
