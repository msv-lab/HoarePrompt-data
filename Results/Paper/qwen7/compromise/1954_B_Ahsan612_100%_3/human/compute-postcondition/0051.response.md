Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`, `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`, `ar` is updated with new integer values from input.**

Explanation: The code sets the variable `same` to 1. This updates the value of `same` but does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `num`, `minn`, `i`, or the process of updating `ar`. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
