Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. However, since `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable (not referenced within the loop), it doesn't affect the loop condition.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop condition is determined by the expression `int(input())`. This means the loop will run as long as the input is a positive integer.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The array `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\) and the array `a` is beautiful.
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **Adjusting the state**: Since the loop will continue as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer, we need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is a positive integer. Given the constraints, this is always true because `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and \(10^4\).

5. **Conclusion**: The only state that needs to be considered for the loop to execute is the value of `t`, which must be a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
