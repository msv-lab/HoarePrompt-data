Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 3, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
