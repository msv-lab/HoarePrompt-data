Output State: **`same` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is increased by 1, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
