Based on the initial state provided:

- `same` is an integer.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `num` is the first element of the list `ar`.
- `minn` is initially the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`.
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
- `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between its previous value and `same`.
- `minn` is not equal to infinity and `minn` is not equal to the length of `ar`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the value of `minn`:

1. `minn` starts as the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`. This means `minn` could be either `ar[1]`, `ar[2]`, or `same`, whichever is smaller.
2. `minn` is then updated to be the minimum value between its previous value and `same`. This ensures that `minn` does not increase but only decreases or stays the same.

Since `minn` is not equal to infinity and not equal to the length of `ar`, it must be a finite integer value that is at least 0 (since list indices and integer values are non-negative).

Therefore, `minn` will be the smallest value among `ar[1]`, `ar[2]`, and `same`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the smallest value among ar[1], ar[2], and same)**
