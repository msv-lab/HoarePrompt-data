Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is now `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of 2 and `same`, `i` is `i + 1` and is less than `len(ar)`**.

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `same` to 1. This changes the value of `same` but does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the other variables remain unchanged, and the updated value of `same` is included in the output state.
