Output State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is `ar[3]`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 3, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` assigns the value of the fourth element in the list `ar` (since list indices start at 0) to the variable `num`. The value of `i` is 3, so `num` is now set to `ar[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
