Output State: **`same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between its previous value and `same`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `minn` has been updated to reflect the smallest value found between its initial comparison values (`ar[1]` and `ar[2]`) and the value of `same` during the iterations. The other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
