Output State: **`same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `i` is 3, `num` is equal to `ar[3]`**

Explanation: The code `same = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. No other variables are affected, so their previous values remain unchanged. The precondition that `len(ar)` must be at least 2 is also still valid.
