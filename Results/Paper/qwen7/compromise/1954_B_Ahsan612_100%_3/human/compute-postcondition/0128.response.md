Postcondition: **`same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is equal to `ar[0]` or `ar[i]`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same` (or 1), `i` is set to a value such that `i + 1 < len(ar)` or `i + 2 < len(ar)`, and `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`**.

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If the condition `ar[i] == num` is true, `same` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `same` is reset to 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `num`, `minn`, `i`, and `ar[i-1]`) maintain their respective conditions as described.
