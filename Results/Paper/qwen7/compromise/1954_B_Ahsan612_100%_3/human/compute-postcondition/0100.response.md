Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `num` is now equal to `ar[0]`, `minn` is infinity, and `i` is equal to len(`ar`) - 1.**

Explanation: The line `minn = inf` assigns the value of infinity to the variable `minn`. All other variables retain their previous values and states.
