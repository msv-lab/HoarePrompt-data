Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `same` is an integer, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between `ar[1]` and `ar[2]` after updating with `same`, and `i + 1 < len(ar)`. If `ar[i]` equals `num`, then `i` is incremented by 2 and `same` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `same` is set to 1 and `num` is updated to the value of `ar[i]`.
