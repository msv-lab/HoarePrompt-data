Output State: **`i` is 5, `k` is 4, `b` is `p[b] - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `b = p[b] - 1` updates the value of `b` to be the value of `p[b]` minus 1. However, since the initial state does not provide the value of `p`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `b`. All other variables (`i` and `k`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
