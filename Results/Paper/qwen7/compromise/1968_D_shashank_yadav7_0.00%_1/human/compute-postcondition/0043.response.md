Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, (p[b] - 2) * -2 + bp) + max(bm, (p[b] - 2) * -2 + bp)`, `i` is 2, `bp` is `bp` + `a[b] * 2`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is -2, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]` three times, `sm` is `sm` + `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `sm` is `sm` + `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`.**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments `sp` by the value of `a[s]`. Since `sp` was already increased by `a[s]` once before, it is now increased by `a[s]` a total of three times. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state or the state after the previous operations.
