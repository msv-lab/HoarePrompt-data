Output State: **`i` is 10, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is `2 * bm + max(2 * bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b] + bp + a[b]`**

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Initially, `bp` was defined as `a[b] + a[b] + bp`. After the increment, `bp` becomes `a[b] + a[b] + bp + a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
