Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -2, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `sp` is incremented by the value of `a[s]` three times, `bp` is incremented by the value of `a[b]` three times, `bm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp`, `sm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp`**.

Explanation: The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`. The values of `i`, `k`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are updated as follows:
- `sp` is incremented by the value of `a[s]` three times.
- `bp` is incremented by the value of `a[b]` three times.
- `bm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp`.
- `sm` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp`.

The initial values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `s` and `b` now hold the input values. The values of `n`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are dependent on the input values and the operations performed.
