Postcondition: `i` is 7, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`. If `bm` is less than `sm`, then `bm` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`.
