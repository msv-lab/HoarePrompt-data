Output State: **`i` is 8, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `bm` by adding the maximum of its current value and the value of `a[b] * k + bp`. Given that `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to `a[b] * 0 + bp`, which is just `bp`. Since `k` is 0, the term `a[b] * k` becomes 0, so the new value of `bm` is simply `max(bm, bp)`. The values of `i`, `b`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged.
