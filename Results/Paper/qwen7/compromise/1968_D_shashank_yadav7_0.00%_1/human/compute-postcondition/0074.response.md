Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`**

Explanation: The code `b = p[b] - 1` updates the value of `b` to be the value of `p[b]` minus 1. Since `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but the initial condition that `k` is 0 remains unchanged. The value of `i` remains 3 as it was not affected by the code.
