State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = t-1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial value of `i` is set to 0 by the `range(t)` function.
4. Since `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), this constraint is already satisfied and does not need adjustment.
5. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `t` is greater than 0 (which is implied by the given range) and setting `i` to 0.

So, the final state is: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0**.
