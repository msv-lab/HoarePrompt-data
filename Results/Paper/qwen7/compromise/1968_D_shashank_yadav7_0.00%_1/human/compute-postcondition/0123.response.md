Output State: **`i` is 8, `k` is -3, `b` is an input integer, `s` is `s - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `bm = a[b] * k` updates the value of `bm` to be the product of `a[b]` and `k`. The values of `i`, `s`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
