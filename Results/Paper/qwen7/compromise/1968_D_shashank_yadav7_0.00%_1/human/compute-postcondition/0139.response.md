Output State: **`i` is 9, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**.

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. The values of `i`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation `k -= 1`.
