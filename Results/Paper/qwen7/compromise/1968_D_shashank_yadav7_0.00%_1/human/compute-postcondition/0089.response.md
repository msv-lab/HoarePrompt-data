Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `2 * bm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `2 * a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + a[b]`**

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Since `b` is defined as `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, and `s` is defined as `p[s] - 1`, these definitions remain unchanged. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`) also remain unchanged. Therefore, `bp` is updated to be `a[b] + bp + a[b]`.
