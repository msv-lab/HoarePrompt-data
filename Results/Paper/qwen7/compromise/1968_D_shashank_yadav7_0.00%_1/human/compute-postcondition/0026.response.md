Output State: **`sm` is `sm` + max(`sm`, `a[s]` * `k` + `sp`), `i` is 0, `bp` is `bp` + `a[b]`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is -1, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `sp` is increased by `a[s]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the loop or the innermost if-structure it is within. Since no variables are reassigned or modified by the `break` statement itself, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
