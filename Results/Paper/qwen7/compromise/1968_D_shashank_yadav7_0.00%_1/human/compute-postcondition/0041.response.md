Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, (p[b] - 2) * -2 + bp) + max(bm, (p[b] - 2) * -2 + bp)`, `i` is 2, `bp` is `bp` + `a[b] * 2`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is -2, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]` twice, `sm` is `sm` + `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`.**

Explanation: The line `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` updates `bm` by adding to it the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`. Here, `a[b] * k + bp` simplifies to `(p[b] - 2) * -2 + bp`, which further simplifies to `-2 * p[b] + 4 + bp`. Since `k` is -2, the expression remains the same. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
