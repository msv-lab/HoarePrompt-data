Postcondition: **`i` is 7, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is at least as large as `sm`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is updated to be at least as large as `sm`. If `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, then `bm` remains unchanged. The values of `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` follow the described update rules in both cases.
