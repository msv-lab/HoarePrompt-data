Output State: **`i` is 8, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by adding the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`. Given that `k` is 0, the term `a[s] * k + sp` simplifies to `sp`. Therefore, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, sp)`. The values of `i`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, and `bp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
