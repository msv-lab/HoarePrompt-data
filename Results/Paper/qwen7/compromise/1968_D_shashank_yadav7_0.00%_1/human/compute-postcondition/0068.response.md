Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: We know that `i` is initially set to 3.

3. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: Since `n` is not explicitly given in the initial state, we need to figure out what `n` should be for the loop to execute. The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Given that `i` starts at 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Check other variables**: The other variables (`k`, `b`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, `a`, and `s`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop executes. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

5. **Formulate the final state**: Based on the above analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
