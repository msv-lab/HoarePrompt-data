Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid, and now `t` also holds the specific value input by the user. All other variables (n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a) remain in their initial state as described in the precondition.
