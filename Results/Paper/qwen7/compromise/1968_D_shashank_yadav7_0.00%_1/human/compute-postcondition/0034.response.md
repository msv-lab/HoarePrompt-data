Output State: **`bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `i` is 0, `bp` is `bp` + `a[b] * 2`, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is -1, `s` is `p[s]` - 1, `sp` is increased by `a[s]` twice, `sm` is `sm` + `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. Since `bp` was previously `bp + a[b]`, after this line, `bp` becomes `bp + a[b] + a[b]`, which simplifies to `bp + 2 * a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
