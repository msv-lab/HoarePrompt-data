Output State: **`i` is 9, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1` - 1, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` by subtracting 1 from `p[s]`. Since the initial state of `s` is `p[s] - 1`, updating `s` means that `s` now becomes `p[s] - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `p[s] - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
