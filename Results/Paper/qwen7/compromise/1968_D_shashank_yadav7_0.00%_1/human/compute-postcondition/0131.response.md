Output State: **`i` is 8, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`**.

In this case, the code `b = p[b] - 1` updates the value of `b` to be the value of `p[b]` decremented by 1. However, since the initial state does not specify what `p` is, we cannot determine the exact value of `b`. We only know that `b` is now `p[b] - 1`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
