`s` is decremented by 1. Initially, `s` was `-1` (since `s -= 1` and `s` was `3` before this operation). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -2, `b` is `input integer - 1`, `b` -= 1, `sp` is incremented by the value of `a[s]` three times, `bp` is incremented by the value of `a[b]` three times, `bm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[b]`, `k`, and `bp`, `sm` is the maximum of its current value and two calculations involving `a[s]`, `k`, and `sp`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from user input, `s` is 2.**
