You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of n constraints where n is an integer. Each constraint is represented by two integers a and x, where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of n constraints where n is an integer. Each constraint is represented by two integers a and x, where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. If `space` is True, `line` is split into a list of strings stored in `items`. Otherwise, `items` is a list of characters from a line.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers converted from the items in the list `items` where `to_int` is True and `space` is True, meaning `line` is split into a list of strings stored in `items`.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns the list `items` which contains characters from a line without being split into a list of strings.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `space` (a boolean) and `to_int` (a boolean). It returns a list of integers if both `to_int` and `space` are True, where the list is obtained by converting the items in the list `items` into integers. If `to_int` is False or `space` is False, it returns the list `items` as is, which contains characters from a line without being split into a list of strings.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list of integers converted from the items in the list `items` where `to_int` is True and `space` is True, meaning `line` is split into a list of strings stored in `items`.

Case_2: The program returns the list `items` which contains characters from a line without being split into a list of strings.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
