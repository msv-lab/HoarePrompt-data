t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of n constraints where n is an integer. Each constraint is represented by two integers a and x, where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
