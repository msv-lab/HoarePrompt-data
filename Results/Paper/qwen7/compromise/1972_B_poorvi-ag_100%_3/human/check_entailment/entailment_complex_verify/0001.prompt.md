You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` integers are appended to the `results` list. If the count of 'U' in each input string `arr` is odd, 'yes' is appended; otherwise, 'no' is appended.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list contains 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in each input string `arr` is odd or even, respectively, and then each element in `results` is printed on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` and strings `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It checks if the count of "U" in each string `s` is odd or even and appends "yes" or "no" to the `results` list accordingly. Finally, it prints each element in the `results` list on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force a win by playing optimally. If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can force a win by playing optimally.

3. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It checks if the count of 'U' (facing-up coins) is odd using `arr.count('U') % 2 == 1`.
   - If the count is odd, it appends 'yes' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'.
   - Finally, it prints each result from the results list.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even.
   - Based on this, it decides the winner correctly.
   - The output format matches the requirements (case-insensitive).

Since the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
