Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. For each test case, it returns information about the lengths of the sticks.**

This means the function takes a series of test cases as input, where each test case consists of an integer indicating the number of sticks, followed by the lengths of those sticks. The function then processes these inputs and returns information related to the lengths of the sticks for each test case.
