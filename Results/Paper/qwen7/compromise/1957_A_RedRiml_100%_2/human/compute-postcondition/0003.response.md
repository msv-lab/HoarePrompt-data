Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list named `palka` by taking a single line of space-separated integers as input, splitting the input string into individual elements, and converting each element to an integer using the `map` function. The original values of `t`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged, but now `palka` holds the list of integers derived from the input.
