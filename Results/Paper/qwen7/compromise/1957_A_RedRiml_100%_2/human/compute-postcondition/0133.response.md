Output State: **`i` is the third element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the third element of `palka` twice, and `d` is a dictionary where the value of the third element of `palka` is set to 1 if it was initially `None`, or incremented by 1 if it was not `None`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is the third element of `palka`) to the list `pl`. Since `i` was already in `pl` (as the third element of `palka`), now `pl` contains the third element of `palka` twice. The dictionary `d` remains unchanged in terms of its structure but retains the same conditions regarding the value of the third element of `palka`.
