Output State: **`d` is a dictionary, `i` is a key in `d`, and the value of `d.get(i)` is now one more than its original value.**

Explanation: The code increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Since the initial value of `d.get(i)` is not `None`, it implies that `i` exists in the dictionary and has some initial value. After executing `d[i] += 1`, the value of `d.get(i)` will be increased by 1.
