Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `palka`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `palka` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is the next element in the list `palka`.
   - `pl` is a list with one additional element which is `i`.
   - `d[i]` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1 depending on its current value.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `palka`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the last element processed from `palka`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `palka`.
   - `pl` will have one more element added to it, which is `i`.
   - `d[i]` will be updated (set to 1 or incremented by 1).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `palka` remains the same list of integers.
   - `i` will be the next element in `palka`.
   - `pl` will have one additional element, which is `i`.
   - `d[i]` will be updated based on its current value.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`palka` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in the list `palka`, `pl` is a list with two additional elements which are `i`, and `d[i]` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1 depending on its current value.**
