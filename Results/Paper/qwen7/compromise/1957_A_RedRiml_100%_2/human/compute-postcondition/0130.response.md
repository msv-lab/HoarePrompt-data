Output State: **`i` is the third element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the third element of `palka` appended once, `d` is a dictionary where the key `i` is mapped to 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` sets the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` to 1. Since `i` is the third element of `palka`, `pl` remains unchanged as it is just a list containing the third element of `palka` appended once. The dictionary `d` now has the key `i` mapped to 1, regardless of its initial value (whether it was `None` or not).
