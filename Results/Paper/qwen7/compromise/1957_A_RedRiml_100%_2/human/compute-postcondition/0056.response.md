Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which iterates over the elements of `palka`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `palka` is not empty.
   - Before the loop starts, `palka` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.
   - The other variables (`d`, `pl`, `w`, and `ln`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

3. **Formulate the required state**:
   - Since the loop depends on `palka` having at least one element, `palka` must contain at least one integer.
   - The other variables do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer**.
