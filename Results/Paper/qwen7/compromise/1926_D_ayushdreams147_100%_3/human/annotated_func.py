#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that each integer in the list is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
            if count[num] == 0:
                del count[num]
        
    #State: Output State: `res` is the number of unique pairs of integers in the list `a` such that one integer is the bitwise complement of the other, `count` is an empty dictionary, and `n` is the length of the list `a`.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique pairs of integers in the list 'a' such that one integer is the bitwise complement of the other.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It calculates and returns the number of unique pairs of integers in the list `a` such that one integer is the bitwise complement of the other. After executing, the function sets `res` to the count of these unique pairs, makes `count` an empty dictionary, and leaves `n` unchanged.
