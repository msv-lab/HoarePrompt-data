You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes `n` and `a` as input.
   - It initializes `res` (result) to 0 and a dictionary `count` to keep track of the counts of transformed numbers.
   - It iterates through each number in `a`:
     - If the number `num` is not already in `count`, it transforms `num` using the operation `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` and updates the count of this transformed number. It also increments `res` by 1.
     - If the number `num` is already in `count`, it decrements the count of `num`. If the count of `num` becomes zero, it removes `num` from `count`.

3. **Transformation Explanation**:
   - The transformation `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` flips all the bits of `num`. This means that if `num` and another number `x` have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits, their transformed versions will not match.
   - By counting the unique transformed numbers, the function determines the minimum number of groups needed.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Bit Matching Condition**:
   - The condition `x_2(i) != y_2(i)` for all `1 ≤ i < 32` is satisfied by ensuring that no two numbers in the same group have the same transformed value. This is because flipping all bits ensures that if two numbers have matching bits, their transformed values will not match.

2. **Group Counting**:
   - The function correctly counts the number of unique transformed values, which corresponds to the minimum number of groups required.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as multiple zeros or identical numbers correctly by ensuring that each unique transformed value is counted only once.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of groups required to satisfy the condition.

**Correctness: True**
