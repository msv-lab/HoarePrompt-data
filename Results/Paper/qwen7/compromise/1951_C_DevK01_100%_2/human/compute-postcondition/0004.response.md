Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, it processes integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)), and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). The function does not return any value directly but processes these inputs according to their constraints.**
