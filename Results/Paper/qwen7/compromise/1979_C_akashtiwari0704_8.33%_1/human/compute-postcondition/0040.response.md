Postcondition: **`sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` is greater than 0, `prod` is equal to the product of all elements in the list `a` up to index `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then `sumo` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is set to `bets`, `ans` is a string containing the concatenation of `str(a[i])` followed by a space for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, and `bets` is incremented by the total number of iterations in the loop.**
