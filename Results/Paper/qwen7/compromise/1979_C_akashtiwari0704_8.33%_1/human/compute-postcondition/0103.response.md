Postcondition: **`bets` is at least the total number of iterations in the loop, `i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is the sum of the integer division of `prod` by each element in `a` for all iterations, and each element in `a` is updated to the result of `prod // a[i]` for its respective index. Additionally, the condition `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod` holds true.**
