Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop. Here, the loop variable is `i` and the control variable is `bets`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `bets`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `bets` must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` is a string that has been appended with `str(a[i])` followed by a space.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than `bets`. Therefore, `bets` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `ans` will be updated by appending `str(a[i+1])` followed by a space.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `bets` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `ans` will be a string that has been appended with `str(a[i+1])` followed by a space.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a string that has been appended with `str(a[i+1])` followed by a space**.
