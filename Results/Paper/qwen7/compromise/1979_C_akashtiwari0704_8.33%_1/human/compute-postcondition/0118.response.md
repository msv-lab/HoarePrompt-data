Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where for each case, it takes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list `k` of `n` positive integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t`, `n`, and a list `k`. The function processes these inputs and produces a result for each test case, but the specific nature of the result is not detailed in the provided information.
