Output State: `i` is equal to `bets`, `ans` is a string containing the concatenation of `str(a[i])` followed by a space for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, and `bets` has been incremented by the total number of iterations in the loop.

In simpler terms: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `bets`, `ans` will contain a space-separated string of all elements in the list `a` up to index `bets-1`, and `bets` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed.
