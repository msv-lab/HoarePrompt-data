Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[i-1]) + int(a[i])`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the value of `int(a[i])`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after executing `a[i] = prod // a[i]`, `i` becomes 3. Therefore, `sumo` is now increased by `int(a[3])`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
