Output State: **`sumo` is increased by `int(a[i])`, `i` is less than `bets`, and `bets` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the integer value of `a[i]` to `sumo`. The other conditions and variables (`i` being less than `bets` and `bets` being greater than 0) remain unchanged.
