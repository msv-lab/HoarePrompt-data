Output State: **`sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` is an input integer, `prod` is equal to the product of all elements in the list `a` up to index `bets - 1`, `T` is `T + 1`, and `t` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `bets = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `bets`. The other variables (`sumo`, `i`, `prod`, `T`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
