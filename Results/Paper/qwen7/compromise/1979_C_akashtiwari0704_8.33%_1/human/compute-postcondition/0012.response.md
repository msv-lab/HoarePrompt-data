Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is equal to `bets - 1`; `prod` is equal to the product of all elements in the list `a` up to index `bets - 1`.

This means that `i` will take on the value of `bets - 1` after the loop completes, as it increments with each iteration. The variable `prod` will hold the cumulative product of the first `bets` elements of the list `a`.
