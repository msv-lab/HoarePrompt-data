Output State: **`sumo` is 0, `i` is equal to `bets - 1`, `prod` is equal to the product of all elements in the list `a` up to index `bets - 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes `sumo` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `i` or `prod`. The variable `i` remains equal to `bets - 1` after the loop completes, and `prod` retains the product of the elements in the list `a` up to the index `bets - 1`. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
