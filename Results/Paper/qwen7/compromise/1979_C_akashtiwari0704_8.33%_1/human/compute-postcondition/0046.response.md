Output State: **`i` is within the range [0, `bets-1`], `prod` is equal to `prod * a[i]`**

Explanation: The code multiplies the variable `prod` by `a[i]`. Since `i` is within the range [0, `bets-1`], it means `i` is a valid index for the list `a`. The value of `prod` is updated to its current value multiplied by the value at index `i` of the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
