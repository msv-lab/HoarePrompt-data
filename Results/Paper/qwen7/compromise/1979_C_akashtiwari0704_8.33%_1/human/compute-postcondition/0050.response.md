Output State: **`i` is `bets + 1`; `prod` is equal to `prod * a[bets-1] * a[i] * a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `prod *= a[i]` multiplies the current value of `prod` by `a[i]`. Given the initial state where `prod` is equal to `prod * a[bets-1] * a[i]`, after executing the code, `prod` will be updated to `prod * a[bets-1] * a[i] * a[i]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only modifies `prod`.
