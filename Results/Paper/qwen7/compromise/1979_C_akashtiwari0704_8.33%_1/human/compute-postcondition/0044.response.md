Output State: **`prod` is 1, `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[i])` for each `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` is an input integer, `T` is `T + 1`, and `t` remains unchanged, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The line `prod = 1` initializes the variable `prod` to 1. All other variables (`sumo`, `i`, `bets`, `T`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
