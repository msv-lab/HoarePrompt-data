Output State: **`sumo` is 0, `i` is equal to `bets`, `prod` is equal to the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets-1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sumo` to 0. The values of `i` and `prod` remain unchanged from their previous states after the initialization of `sumo`. Therefore, `i` is still equal to `bets`, and `prod` is still equal to the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets-1`.
