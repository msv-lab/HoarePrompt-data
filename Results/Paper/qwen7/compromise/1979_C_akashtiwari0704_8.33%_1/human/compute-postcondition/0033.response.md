Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `bets`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `bets`
   - `ans` is a string containing the character `str(a[i])` followed by a space
   - `bets` must be greater than or equal to 1

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `bets`.
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `bets`, it cannot be incremented further within this loop iteration.
   - Therefore, `bets` must be decreased by 1 to allow `i` to be less than `bets` in the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains unchanged (it is still equal to `bets`).
   - `bets` is decreased by 1.
   - `ans` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `ans` within the loop.

6. **Final state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `bets`
   - `ans` is a string containing the character `str(a[i])` followed by a space
   - `bets` must be greater than or equal to 0 (since it was originally greater than or equal to 1 and is now decreased by 1)

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is equal to `bets`, `ans` is a string containing the character `str(a[i])` followed by a space, `bets` must be greater than or equal to 0**
