Output State: **`sumo` is `prod // a[2] + int(a[2])`, `i` is 3, `a[3]` is `prod // a[3]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` where `i` is 3. So, `a[3]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `sumo` remains as `prod // a[2] + int(a[2])`, `i` is still 3, and `a[3]` is updated to `prod // a[3]`.
