The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of cases, then for each case, it reads another positive integer `bets` and a list of `bets` positive integers. It calculates the product of all elements in the list, divides this product by each element in the list, sums these divisions, and checks if the sum is greater than or equal to the original product. If true, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it constructs a string of the modified list elements separated by spaces and prints this string.
