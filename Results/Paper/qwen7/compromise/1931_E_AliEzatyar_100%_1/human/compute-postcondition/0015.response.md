Output State: **`counter` is 2 if `num[len(num) - 1]` equals '0' and `num[i]` also equals '0', otherwise `counter` is 1 if `num[len(num) - 1]` equals '0' and `num[i]` does not equal '0', or `counter` remains 0 if `num[len(num) - 1]` does not equal '0'; `i` is -1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the value of `counter` remains unchanged from its initial state based on the conditions given, `i` is set to -1, and the loop or if statement is exited.
