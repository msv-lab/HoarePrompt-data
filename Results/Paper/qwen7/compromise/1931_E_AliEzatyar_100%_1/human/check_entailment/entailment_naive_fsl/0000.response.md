Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the game mechanics properly. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is used to count trailing zeros in a string representation of a number. However, the logic for counting trailing zeros is correct.

2. **Game Mechanics**: The program attempts to determine the winner by calculating the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros. It then checks if the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of the largest trailing zeros is greater than or equal to \( m + 1 \). This logic is flawed because it does not simulate the actual game process where players take turns reversing digits and concatenating numbers.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The program does not simulate the game turns or check if Sasha can form a number greater than or equal to \( 10^m \) after Anna's move. Instead, it makes a static determination based on the total digit count and trailing zeros, which does not reflect the dynamic nature of the game.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 5
  9 56 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  Anna
  ```

- Program Output:
  The program incorrectly determines the winner based on the digit count and trailing zeros, which does not reflect the actual game dynamics.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus is incorrect.
