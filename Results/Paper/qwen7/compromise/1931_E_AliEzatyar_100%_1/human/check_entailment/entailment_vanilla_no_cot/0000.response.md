Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Functionality of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to count the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of a number. However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed. It should check the characters from the end of the string, but it breaks out of the loop too early. It should continue counting until it finds a non-zero character.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The logic for determining the winner is based on the total number of digits (`total_digits`) and the number of trailing zeros (`subtract_zero`). This logic is not aligned with the rules of the game. Specifically, the game involves reversing digits for Anna and concatenating numbers for Sasha. The current logic does not correctly simulate these operations.

3. **Misinterpretation of Game Rules:**
   - The solution does not correctly simulate the game where Anna reverses digits and Sasha concatenates numbers. Instead, it attempts to count trailing zeros and compare the difference to `m`. This does not reflect the actual game mechanics.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game according to the rules:

1. **Simulate Anna's Moves:**
   - Anna can reverse any digit in the list. This means changing the order of digits in a number but removing leading zeros.

2. **Simulate Sasha's Moves:**
   - Sasha can concatenate any two numbers in the list and remove one number from the list.

3. **Determine the Winner:**
   - The game ends when only one number remains. If this number is at least \(10^m\), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna wins.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test

for test in range(n_test):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Simulate the game
    while len(array) > 1:
        # Anna's move: Reverse any number
        if len(array) % 2 == 1:
            array[0] = int(str(array[0])[::-1])
        
        # Sasha's move: Concatenate two numbers
        a, b = array.pop(), array.pop()
        array.append(a * 10**len(str(b)) + b)

    # Check the final number
    final_number = array[0]
    if final_number >= 10**m:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

This solution correctly simulates the game according to the rules and determines the winner based on the final number.
