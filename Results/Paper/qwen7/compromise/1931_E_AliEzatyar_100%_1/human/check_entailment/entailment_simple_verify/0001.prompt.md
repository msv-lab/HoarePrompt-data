You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Output

    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Anna
    Anna
    Anna
    Sasha
    
Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic for the described game.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the list of integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes variables `total_digits` and `zeros` to keep track of the total number of digits and the count of trailing zeros in each number, respectively.
   - It iterates over the list of integers, calculating the length of each integer (`len(item)`) and the number of trailing zeros using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of the integer.
   - The `zeros` list is sorted in descending order.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program calculates `subtract_zero` by summing every other element in the sorted `zeros` list starting from the highest.
   - It checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is at least `m + 1`. If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the winner for each test case.

### Key Points to Verify

1. **Counting Trailing Zeros:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly counts trailing zeros in a number. This is necessary to determine how many digits can potentially be reduced by Anna's moves.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The logic for determining the winner is based on the difference between the total number of digits and the sum of selected trailing zeros. However, this logic might not fully capture the strategic aspects of the game.

3. **Optimal Play:**
   - The program assumes that the players will always make optimal moves. The current logic might not account for all strategic possibilities, especially since the game involves complex interactions between Sasha and Anna's moves.

### Detailed Verification

- **Trailing Zeros Calculation:**
  - The `func_1` function works correctly.

- **Winner Determination:**
  - The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` is used to determine the winner. This condition is based on the assumption that Sasha can always find a way to concatenate numbers to form a number larger than \(10^m\). However, this might not be true in all scenarios, especially if the numbers are strategically chosen by Anna.

### Conclusion

The program's logic seems to be based on a simplified version of the game's rules and might not fully capture the complexity of optimal play. Given the constraints and the nature of the game, the current implementation might not always produce the correct result.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The program is not entirely correct because it does not fully account for the strategic aspects of the game and might not handle all edge cases optimally.
