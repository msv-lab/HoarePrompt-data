### Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(s)` is supposed to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. This involves calculating the cumulative distances between '>' and '<' characters, both forward and backward.

2. **Forward Calculation (`A`)**:
   - The function correctly calculates the cumulative distances from each '>' character to the nearest '<' character, moving from left to right.
   - This part of the code is implemented correctly, and the logic for updating `A` and `idx_A` is sound.

3. **Backward Calculation (`B`)**:
   - The function also correctly calculates the cumulative distances from each '<' character to the nearest '>' character, moving from right to left.
   - This part of the code is implemented correctly, and the logic for updating `B` and `idx_B` is sound.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final loop iterates through each cell and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the forward and backward distances.
   - The logic for determining whether to use the forward or backward distances is correct.
   - The calculations for `a` and `b` are correct and consistent with the problem's requirements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when there are no '>' or '<' characters correctly.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the pinball starts at the boundary of the grid.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the correct values for each cell, which is verified by the example provided.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1(s)` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. There are no apparent errors in the logic or implementation.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
