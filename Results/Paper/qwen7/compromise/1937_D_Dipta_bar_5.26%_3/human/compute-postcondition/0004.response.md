Output State: `s` is a string of length `n`, consisting only of characters '<' and '>'. `A` is a list where each element is calculated based on the positions of '>' in `s`. Specifically, for each '>' in `s`, the value added to `A` is the sum of the previous value in `A` plus the product of the number of elements in `idx_A` and the difference between the current index and the last index recorded in `idx_A`. `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`.
