Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the constant `n`. Therefore, we need to focus on adjusting the states of `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` being 0, as the range function in Python starts from 0 by default.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. Since `n` is the length of the string `s`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` should be set to 0 initially.
   - `n` should be set to the length of the string `s`, and this value must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the adjusted states are:

State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list where each element represents the cumulative sum of positions '>' encountered up to that point, adjusted by the number of previous '>' positions, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, and `n` must be at least 1**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is a list where each element represents the cumulative sum of positions '>' encountered up to that point, adjusted by the number of previous '>' positions, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, and `n` must be at least 1**.
