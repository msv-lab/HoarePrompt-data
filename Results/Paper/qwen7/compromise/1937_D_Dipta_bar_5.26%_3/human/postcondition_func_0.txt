The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of '<' and '>', and prints a series of values based on the relative positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. Specifically, it calculates and prints the cumulative distances from each '>' character to the nearest '<' character and vice versa, considering the positions of these characters in reverse order. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the calculated values directly.
