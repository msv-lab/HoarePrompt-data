Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.

- **Condition Check**: 
  - The program checks if `n` (number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (desired number of cubes).
  - It also checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This ensures that the operations (adding and removing cubes) can balance out to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.
  
- **Output**:
  - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES".
  - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program is correct.
