### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move involves adding or removing exactly one cube.
   - The key conditions for this are:
     - `n` must be greater than or equal to `m` (since we need at least `m` moves to add `m` cubes).
     - The difference between `n` and `m` must be even (since every addition and removal cancels out in pairs).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function iterates over the number of test cases specified by `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n < m`, the condition `n >= m` fails, and the program correctly prints "NO".
   - If `(n - m) % 2 != 0`, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` fails, and the program correctly prints "NO".
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program correctly prints "YES".

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
