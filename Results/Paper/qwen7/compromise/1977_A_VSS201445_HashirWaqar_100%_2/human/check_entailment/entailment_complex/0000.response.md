Reasoning:
The provided function correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This is done using a loop that runs `t` times.

2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, the function reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then checks two conditions:
   - `n >= m`: This ensures that there are enough moves to potentially achieve the desired number of cubes.
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which means that the operations (adding and removing cubes) can balance out to result in `m` cubes.

3. **Output Generation**: Based on the above conditions, the function prints "YES" if both conditions are satisfied, indicating that it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given these points, the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the expected output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
