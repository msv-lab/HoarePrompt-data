Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Conditions Check**:
   - The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` (`n >= m`).
   - If this condition is true, it further checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even (`(n - m) % 2 == 0`).

3. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Reasoning:

- **Condition `n >= m`**:
  - This condition ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as many as the desired number of cubes `m`. This is necessary because removing cubes cannot result in more cubes than initially added.

- **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**:
  - This condition checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is crucial because each move can either add or remove one cube, which means the total change in the number of cubes must be an even number. 

### Example Scenarios:

1. **Test Case: `n = 3`, `m = 3`**
   - `n >= m` is true.
   - `(n - m) = 0`, which is even.
   - Output: "YES"

2. **Test Case: `n = 2`, `m = 4`**
   - `n >= m` is false.
   - Therefore, the output is "NO".

3. **Test Case: `n = 5`, `m = 3`**
   - `n >= m` is true.
   - `(n - m) = 2`, which is even.
   - Output: "YES"

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. It checks both necessary conditions: `n` must be at least `m`, and the difference `(n - m)` must be even.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
