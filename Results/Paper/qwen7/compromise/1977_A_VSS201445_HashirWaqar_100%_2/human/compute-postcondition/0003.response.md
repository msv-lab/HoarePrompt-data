Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes three integers: t, n, and m, with t being a positive integer between 1 and 100, and n, m being positive integers between 1 and 100. For each test case, the function returns a value based on the relationship between n and m.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing t, n, and m, and returns a value (not specified here) based on the comparison between n and m.
