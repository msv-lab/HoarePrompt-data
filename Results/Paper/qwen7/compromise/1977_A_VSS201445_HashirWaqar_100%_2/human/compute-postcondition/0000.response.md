Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This means that `int(input())` will read an integer from input, and this integer should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).

3. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value falls within this range.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that the input value must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the input value must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
