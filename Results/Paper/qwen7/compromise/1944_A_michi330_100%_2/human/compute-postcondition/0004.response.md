Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers n and k as part of a test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 represents the number of test cases. It returns a result based on the relationship between n and k for each test case.**
