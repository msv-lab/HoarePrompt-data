Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most `k` bridges.
2. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
4. If `k >= n - 1`, the program prints `1`, meaning Everule can only visit island 1.
5. Otherwise, it prints `n`, indicating that Everule can visit all `n` islands.
6. The logic in the program matches the problem statement and examples provided.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
