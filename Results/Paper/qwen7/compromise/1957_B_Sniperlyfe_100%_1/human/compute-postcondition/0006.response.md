Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` where `nums[0]` is equal to `nums[0] + k` and all other elements `nums[i]` (for i from 1 to n-1) are equal to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`, with `k` being reduced accordingly by the value of `nums[i]` during each iteration.**

Explanation: The code `nums[0] += k` increments the value of `nums[0]` by `k`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `nums[0]` is `((1 << (`k`'s bit length)) - 1) - 1 + k`, while the rest of the list `nums` remains as specified in the initial state.
