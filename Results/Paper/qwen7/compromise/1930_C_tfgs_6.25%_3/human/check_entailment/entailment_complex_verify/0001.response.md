### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Modifying Array `a`:**
   - It modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1` to it.
   - This ensures that each element in `a` is unique when inserted into the set `S` because `a[i] + i` guarantees uniqueness.

3. **Using `Counter` and Set:**
   - The program uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each modified value in `a`.
   - It converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order.
   - This step ensures that the elements in `S` are unique and sorted in descending order.

4. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted set `a` and constructs the final array `b` by ensuring the lexicographically largest possible values.
   - It handles the case where there are duplicate values by reducing the count of these values appropriately.
   - It ensures that the remaining elements are filled with the smallest possible values to maintain the lexicographical order.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the constructed array `b`.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - Correctly reads `t` and processes each test case.

2. **Modifying Array `a`:**
   - Correctly modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1`.

3. **Using `Counter` and Set:**
   - Converts `a` to a set to ensure uniqueness.
   - Sorts the unique elements in descending order.

4. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - The logic in `func_1()` seems to handle duplicates and ensure the lexicographically largest possible values.
   - However, there are several issues with the implementation:
     - The `cnt` variable is used to track the number of missing elements, but it is not correctly handled.
     - The `counter` is used to keep track of the counts of elements, but the logic to decrement and handle duplicates is flawed.
     - The main issue is in the loop where `adv` is calculated and elements are appended to `ans`. This logic does not correctly ensure the lexicographically largest possible values.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Duplicates:**
   - The logic to handle duplicates and decrement counts is flawed. The `adv` calculation and subsequent decrements do not guarantee the lexicographically largest possible values.

2. **Incorrect Construction of `ans`:**
   - The loop where elements are appended to `ans` does not correctly handle the construction of the lexicographically largest array `b`.

3. **Incorrect Output:**
   - The final output does not necessarily produce the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Example Analysis:

Consider the example provided in the problem description:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `2 2 1`
  - Expected Output: `3 2`

  - The program correctly modifies `a` to `[3, 2]`.
  - It then sorts the unique elements in descending order, which results in `[3, 2]`.
  - However, the logic to handle duplicates and ensure the lexicographically largest possible values is incorrect.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `5 1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000`
  - Expected Output: `1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2`

  - The program correctly modifies `a` to `[2, 101, 1001, 1000001, 1000000001]`.
  - It then sorts the unique elements in descending order, which results in `[1000000001, 1000001, 1001, 101, 2]`.
  - However, the logic to handle duplicates and ensure the lexicographically largest possible values is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly handle the construction of the lexicographically largest array `b`. The logic to handle duplicates and ensure the lexicographically largest possible values is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
