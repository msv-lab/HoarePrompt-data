Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple elements in the array `a` are equal. According to the problem description, the set `S` should only contain unique elements, and inserting an element that is already present in the set should not change the set. However, the program uses `Counter` and `set` to ensure uniqueness, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the same value is inserted multiple times due to different indices.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 1 1
```

The correct output should be `[3, 2, 1]` because:
- First operation: Select `i=1`, insert `a_1 + 1 = 2` into `S`, delete `a_1`.
- Second operation: Select `i=2`, insert `a_2 + 2 = 3` into `S`, delete `a_2`.
- Third operation: Select `i=3`, insert `a_3 + 3 = 4` into `S`, delete `a_3`.

Thus, `S = {4, 3, 2}` and sorting in descending order gives `[4, 3, 2]`.

However, the program outputs `[4, 3, 1]` because it incorrectly handles the insertion of the same value multiple times. Specifically, when it encounters the same value multiple times, it does not ensure that the set `S` remains unique as required by the problem description. This leads to the incorrect output.
