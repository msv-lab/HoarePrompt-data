Output State: **`i` is 1; `a[0]` is 1; `a[1]` is 2**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` updates the value of `a[i]` by adding `i + 1` to its current value. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `a[0]` is 1, the code calculates `a[1] += 1 + 1`, which means `a[1]` is updated to `2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and `a[0]` also remains unchanged.
