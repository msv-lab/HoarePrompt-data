Output State: **`i` is 2; `a[0]` is 1; `a[1]` is 2; `a[2]` is 3**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` updates the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`. The value of `a[2]` is updated by adding `i + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`. Therefore, `a[2]` becomes 3. The values of `i`, `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 remain unchanged.
