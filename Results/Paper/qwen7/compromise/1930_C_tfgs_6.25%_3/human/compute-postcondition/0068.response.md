Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by `for _ in range(cnt)`. This means the loop variable is an underscore `_`, but it doesn't affect the state directly. The key variables here are `cnt`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `cnt` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1.
   - `cnt` is a positive integer (since the loop ran at least once).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be decremented by 1.
   - The state of `ans` does not change because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `ans` within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `cnt`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1, `cnt` is decreased by 1**
