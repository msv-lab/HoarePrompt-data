Output State: **`ans` is a list where the last element is now the second last element minus 1, `cnt` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `ans` the value of the last element of `ans` minus 1. Since the last element was already decreased by 1 in the initial state, the new last element is the second last element minus 1. The variable `cnt` is also decreased by 1 as mentioned in the initial state.
