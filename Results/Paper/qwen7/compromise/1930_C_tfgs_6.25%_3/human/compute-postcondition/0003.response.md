Output State: **`i` is 0; `a[0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `a[i]` which is `a[0]` is incremented by `0 + 1`, resulting in `a[0]` being 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is only used as an index here.
