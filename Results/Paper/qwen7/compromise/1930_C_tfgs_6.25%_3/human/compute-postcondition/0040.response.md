Output State: `i` is `n`, `j` is `adv`, `ans` is a list with elements `a[n-1] - 1`, `a[n-1] - 2`, `a[n-1] - 3`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`.

Explanation: The loop continues to append the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans` for each iteration where `j` ranges from `0` to `adv - 1`. Given that the loop executes fully, `j` will reach `adv - 1`. Therefore, the list `ans` will contain all values from `a[n-1] - 1` down to `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`. The variable `i` remains `n` as it is not modified within the loop, and `j` becomes `adv` after the last iteration. The variable `cnt` and `counter` are not mentioned in the loop body, so their values remain unchanged from their previous state after the loop completes.
