Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is `0`, `ans` is a list with the element `a[n-1] - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state where `i` is `n` and `j` is `0`, the value of `a[i - 1]` is `a[n - 1]`. Since `j` is `0`, the expression simplifies to `a[n - 1] - 1`. This value is then appended to `ans`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
