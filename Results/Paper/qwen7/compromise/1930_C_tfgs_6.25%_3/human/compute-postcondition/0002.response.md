Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Typically, the loop starts with `i` set to 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

For the loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- `i` must be initialized to 0.
- `n` must be at least 1 (since the loop condition is `i < n`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
