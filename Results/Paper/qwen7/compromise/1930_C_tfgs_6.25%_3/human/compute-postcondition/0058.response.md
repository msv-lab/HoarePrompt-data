Output State: **`adv` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `ans` is a list with three elements which are `a[i-1] - 3`, `a[i-1] - 3`, and `a[i-1] - 2`, and `cnt` is decreased by `adv`.**

Explanation: The code `cnt -= adv` decreases the value of `cnt` by the value of `adv`. Since `adv` must be at least 3, `cnt` is decreased by at least 3. The values of `adv`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
