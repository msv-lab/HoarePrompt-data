Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `j` is `adv-1`, `adv` is greater than 0, `ans` contains the values `a[n-2] - 2`, `a[n-2] - 1`, ..., `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`, `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv` if `i > 0`, and `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code decrements the count of `a[i]` in the `counter` dictionary by 1. Since `i` is `n-1`, the condition `i > 0` is false, so `counter[a[i - 1]]` remains unchanged. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
