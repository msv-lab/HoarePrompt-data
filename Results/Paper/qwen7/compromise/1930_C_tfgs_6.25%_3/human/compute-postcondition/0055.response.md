Output State: **`adv` must be at least 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is a list with three elements which are `a[i-1] - 3`, `a[i-1] - 3`, and `a[i-1] - 2`.**

Explanation: The initial state of `ans` is a list with two elements, both equal to `a[i-1] - 3`. After executing the line `ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)`, the third element is added to the list. Given that `j` is 2, the new element is `a[i-1] - 2`. Therefore, `ans` now contains three elements: `a[i-1] - 3`, `a[i-1] - 3`, and `a[i-1] - 2`.
