Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object with elements {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, ..., n: 1}; `i` is `n-1`; `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` equals 2 for `0 ≤ i < n` and `a` is sorted in descending order; `cnt` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is assigned the value of `n - len(a)`. Since `a` is a list where each element equals 2 for `0 ≤ i < n` and `a` is sorted in descending order, the length of `a` is `n`. Therefore, `cnt` becomes `n - n`, which is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
