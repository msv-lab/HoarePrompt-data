Postcondition: `i` is an integer greater than 0. If `i` > 0, `adv` is at least 3, `j` is 2, `ans` is a list with three elements which are `a[i-1] - 3`, `a[i-1] - 3`, and `a[i-1] - 2`, and `counter[a[i-1]]` is decreased by `adv`. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold true only if the if condition is met.
