You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `i` will be `n-1`; `a` will be a list where each element `a[i]` equals `1 + (i + 1)` for `0 ≤ i < n`. This means `a` will contain the sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. Each element `a[i]` in the list `a` will be equal to `1 + (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `i + 2`. Therefore, the list `a` will contain the sequence starting from `1` up to `n`, i.e., `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `-1`, `j` is `0`, `adv` is `0`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in descending order, `cnt` is `0`, and `counter` is an empty dictionary.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have been decremented below 0, as it starts from `n-1` and is decremented in each iteration. The variable `adv` will eventually become 0 because it is calculated as the minimum of three values, and as `i` reaches 0, the condition `i > 0` will no longer be met, preventing any further decrementing of `cnt` or updating of `counter`. The list `ans` will contain all elements from `a` in descending order, as each element of `a` is appended to `ans` exactly once during its respective iteration. Both `cnt` and `counter` will be 0 and empty, respectively, as they are continuously decremented and updated until their values reach 0 or there are no more elements to process.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `i` is `-1`, `j` is `0`, `adv` is `0`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in descending order with each element decremented by the number of times it has been processed, `cnt` is `0`, and `counter` is an empty dictionary.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [elements of ans] (where ans is a list of elements from a in descending order, each decremented by the number of times it has been processed)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers `a` with associated positive integers `n` and `t`. For each test case, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
