Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 3, `ans` is a list with elements `a[n-1] - 1`, `a[n-1] - 2`, `a[n-1] - 3`, `a[n-1] - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt - 3`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv` - 2, and `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `counter[a[i]] -= 1` decreases the value of `counter[a[i]]` by 1. Previously, `counter[a[i - 1]]` was decreased by `adv - 1`, so now it will be decreased by `adv - 2`. The value of `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
