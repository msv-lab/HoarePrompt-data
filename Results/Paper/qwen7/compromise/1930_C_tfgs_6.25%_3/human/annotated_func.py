#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `i` will be `n-1`; `a` will be a list where each element `a[i]` equals `1 + (i + 1)` for `0 ≤ i < n`. This means `a` will contain the sequence `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. Each element `a[i]` in the list `a` will be equal to `1 + (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `i + 2`. Therefore, the list `a` will contain the sequence starting from `1` up to `n`, i.e., `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `-1`, `j` is `0`, `adv` is `0`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in descending order, `cnt` is `0`, and `counter` is an empty dictionary.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will have been decremented below 0, as it starts from `n-1` and is decremented in each iteration. The variable `adv` will eventually become 0 because it is calculated as the minimum of three values, and as `i` reaches 0, the condition `i > 0` will no longer be met, preventing any further decrementing of `cnt` or updating of `counter`. The list `ans` will contain all elements from `a` in descending order, as each element of `a` is appended to `ans` exactly once during its respective iteration. Both `cnt` and `counter` will be 0 and empty, respectively, as they are continuously decremented and updated until their values reach 0 or there are no more elements to process.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `i` is `-1`, `j` is `0`, `adv` is `0`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` in descending order with each element decremented by the number of times it has been processed, `cnt` is `0`, and `counter` is an empty dictionary.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [elements of ans] (where ans is a list of elements from a in descending order, each decremented by the number of times it has been processed)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It first modifies each element in the list by adding its index plus one. Then, it creates a frequency counter for the elements, removes duplicates, sorts the unique elements in descending order, and calculates a count of missing elements. It constructs a new list `ans` by appending elements from the sorted unique list and decrementing the count of each element accordingly. If there are remaining decrements needed, it appends the last element of `ans` decremented by the required amount. Finally, it prints the resulting list `ans`.
