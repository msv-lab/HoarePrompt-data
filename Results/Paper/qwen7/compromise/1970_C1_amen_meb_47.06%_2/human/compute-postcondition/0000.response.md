Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and the list `numbers` is empty.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `numbers`. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
