Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the initial state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and the list `numbers` is empty**
