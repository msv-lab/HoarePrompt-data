Output State: **The program prints 'Bob' and returns None**

The code `return print('Bob')` first executes the `print('Bob')` statement, which prints 'Bob' to the console. After printing, the `return` statement is executed, which returns `None` as `print()` does not return any value. Therefore, the output state is that 'Bob' is printed to the console and the program returns `None`.
