Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it determines whether 'Alice' or 'Bob' should be printed based on the given conditions. If 'Bob' is printed, the function also returns None.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any input parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it checks certain conditions and prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. In specific scenarios (Case_3), it prints 'Bob' and returns None.
