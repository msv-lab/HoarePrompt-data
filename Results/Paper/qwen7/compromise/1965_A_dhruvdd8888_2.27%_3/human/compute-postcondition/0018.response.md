Postcondition: `cd` is the number of consecutive pairs of 1 in the list `nums`, starting from the first element up to the second last element. `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` remains the input integer, and `nums` remains a list of integers sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 inserted at the beginning. The length of `nums` is now greater than 3. The current value of `cd` is such that `cd` is odd.
