The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it constructs a list `ans` of length \( n \) based on the binary representation of \( k \). Specifically, it identifies the positions of the least significant bits set to 1 in \( k \), and populates `ans` with powers of 2 corresponding to these positions. If the count of such positions plus one equals \( n \), it fills the remaining elements of `ans` with a specific value derived from `k` and zeros. The function outputs the constructed list `ans` for each test case.
