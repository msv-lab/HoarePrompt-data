Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `arr`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `arr`.
3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is 8, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 4, 8]`, `i` is 1, and `ans` is a list with the values `[0, -1, 2]`.
4. **Analyze the loop execution**: In the previous iteration, `i` was set to 1 (the first element of `arr`). Now, for the next iteration, `i` should be set to the next element in the list `arr`, which is 4.
5. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` is now 4, the list `arr` remains the same, but `i` needs to be updated.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `c` is 8, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 4, `ans` is a list with the values [0, -1, 2]**
