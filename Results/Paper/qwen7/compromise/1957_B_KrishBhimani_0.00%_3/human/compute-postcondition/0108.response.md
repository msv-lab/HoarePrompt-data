Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` is the last element in `arr`.
   - `c` is `n`.
   - `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended.
   - The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is the last element of `arr`.
- `ans` is constructed by appending two elements to an initially empty list:
  - The first element is `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i`.
  - The second element is `[0] * (n - len(ans))`, which is a list of zeros with length `n - len(ans)`.

Given these details, let's determine the value of `ans`:
- Initially, `ans = []`.
- The first element is `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i`. Since `ans` is initially empty, `sum(ans)` is 0. Therefore, the first element is `k0 - 0 + 1 << i = k0 + 1 << i`.
- The second element is `[0] * (n - len(ans))`. Since `len(ans)` is now 1, this becomes `[0] * (n - 1)`.

So, `ans` is:
\[ ans = [k0 + 1 << i, [0] * (n - 1)] \]

When the `print(*ans)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The first element is `k0 + 1 << i` (a single number), and the second element is a list of zeros.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **k0 + 1 << i [0 0 ... 0]** (where there are `n - 1` zeros following `k0 + 1 << i`).
