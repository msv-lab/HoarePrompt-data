Output State: **`c` is 8, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 4, `ans` is a list containing [-11]**.

Explanation: The code snippet `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` is incomplete and missing the definition of `k0`. However, since `ans` is not defined before this line, we assume `ans` is being initialized as an empty list before this line of code. Here, `k0` is not defined, so let's assume `k0` is a variable that holds a specific value, say `k0 = 0` for simplicity (since it's not specified). 

Initially, `ans` is an empty list. The first time this line of code runs, `sum(ans)` is 0 because `ans` is empty. So, `k0 - sum(ans)` would be `0 - 0 = 0 - 11 = -11`. This value is appended to `ans`, making `ans` a list containing `-11`.

Since no other variables are affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the final output state is as described.
