Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `l1` is converted to an integer `n`, `k` is `k0` (initial value of `k`) shifted right by `i` bits where `i` is the number of iterations of the loop, `arr` is a list containing integers from `0` to `i-1` inclusive, `i` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, `k` is right-shifted by 1 bit (`k = k >> 1`). This means that after `i` iterations, `k` will be `k0` right-shifted by `i` bits. The condition `if k & 1 == 1:` checks if the least significant bit of `k` is 1, and if so, appends the current value of `i` to `arr`. Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, `arr` will contain the sequence of integers from `0` to `i-1` after `i` iterations.
