Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the first element of `l1` is converted to an integer `n`, `k` is now equal to `k0` (which is initially `k`) right-shifted by the number of iterations of the loop, `arr` is a list containing the integers from `0` to the number of iterations - 1, `i` is equal to the number of iterations, `ans` is an empty list, `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is 2, `c` is equal to `n`, `ans` is a list with two elements where the first element is `k0 - sum(ans)` and the second element is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is 4, `c` is equal to `n` + 1, `ans` is a list with four elements where the first three elements are 1, 1, and `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the fourth element is `2^4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the first element of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n` + 2, `ans` is a list with four elements where the first three elements are 1, 1, and 2, and the fourth element is 16, and the fifth element is 2 raised to the power of `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
