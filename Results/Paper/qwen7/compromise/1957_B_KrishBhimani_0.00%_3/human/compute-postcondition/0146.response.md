Output State: **`c` is 8, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 1, `ans` is a list with the values [0, -1], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 7 to 8. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged. The condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement also remains the same.
