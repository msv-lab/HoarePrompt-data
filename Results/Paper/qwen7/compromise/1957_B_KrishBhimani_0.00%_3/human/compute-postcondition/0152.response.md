Postcondition: `c` is 8, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 4, and `ans` is a list containing [-11]. This is because if `c == n - 1` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, setting `ans` to [-11]. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged if the condition is false.
