Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` takes an input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the specified range, and `l1` is a list of strings resulting from the split operation.
