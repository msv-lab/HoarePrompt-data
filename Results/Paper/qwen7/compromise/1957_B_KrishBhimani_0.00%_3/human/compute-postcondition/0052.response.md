Output State: `arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `c` is equal to `n` + 3, `ans` is a list with five elements where the first four elements are 1, 1, 2, and 16, and the fifth element is 2 raised to the power of `i`.

In this final state, the loop has executed as many times as there are elements in `arr`. The variable `i` takes on the value of the last element in `arr`, which means it has iterated through all the indices in `arr`. The variable `c` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, so after 3 iterations, it equals `n + 3`. The list `ans` contains the values appended during each iteration, starting with 1, 1, and then the sum of previous elements minus `k0`, followed by powers of 2 corresponding to the indices in `arr`.
