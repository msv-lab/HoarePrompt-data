Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` appended, `c` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1` left-shifted by `i` to the list `ans`. Here, `1 << i` means `2^i`. The value of `ans` before this operation is `k0 - sum(ans)`, so after appending `1 << i`, the new value of `ans` becomes `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
