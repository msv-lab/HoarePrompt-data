Output State: **`arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 9, `c` is 0, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `k0` is 0, `n` is 8.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is assigned the value `0`. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, `ans`, `k0`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
