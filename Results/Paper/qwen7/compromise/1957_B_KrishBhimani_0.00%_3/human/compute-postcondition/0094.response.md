Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` contains a new element which is `k0 - sum(ans)`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is calculated as `k0 - sum(ans)`, where `sum(ans)` is the sum of all elements currently in the list `ans`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was defined before and is not affected by this operation. The precondition that `arr` must contain at least one element is still valid.
