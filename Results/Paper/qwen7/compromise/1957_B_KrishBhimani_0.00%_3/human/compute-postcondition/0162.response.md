Output State: **`c` is 10, `arr` is a list containing [1, 4, 8], `i` is 8, `ans` is a list containing [-11, 16, -5, 256]**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`. Here, `i` is 8, so `1 << 8` results in `256`. The list `ans` originally contains `[-11, 16, -5]`, and after appending `256`, it becomes `[-11, 16, -5, 256]`. The values of `c`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
