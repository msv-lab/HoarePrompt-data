Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is 0, `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list with one element which is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently in. All the initial conditions remain unchanged.
