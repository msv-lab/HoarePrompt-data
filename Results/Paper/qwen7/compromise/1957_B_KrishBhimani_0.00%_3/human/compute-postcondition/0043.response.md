Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one element, `i` is 4, `c` is equal to `n` + 1, `ans` is a list with three elements where the first element is 1, the second element is 1, and the third element is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The value of `c` is incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
