Output State: **`arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `k0` is `k`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `n` and `k` are still dependent on the first and second elements of `l1`, respectively.
