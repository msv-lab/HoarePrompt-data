Postcondition: `arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is `k0 + 1`, `c` is `n - 1`, and `ans` contains the value `k0 - sum(ans)`. This is because either the condition `c == n - 1` is true, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement with `ans` set to `k0 - sum(ans)`, or the condition is false, in which case no additional changes occur to the variables.
