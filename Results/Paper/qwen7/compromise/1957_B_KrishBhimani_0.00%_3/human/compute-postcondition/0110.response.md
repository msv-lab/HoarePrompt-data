Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the last element in `arr`, `c` is `n`, `ans` is a list with the value `k0 - sum(ans) + 1 << i` and `[0] * (n - len(ans))` appended, `l1` is a list containing the split input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. This operation does not affect the values of `arr`, `i`, `c`, or `ans`. Instead, it creates a new variable `l1` which contains the split input. Therefore, the initial conditions for `arr`, `i`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged, while `l1` is now populated with the user's input split into a list.
