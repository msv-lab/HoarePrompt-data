Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `pos` is the index in the array `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, to 0 and `n` respectively. The variable `pos` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is the index in the array `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not in `arr`. Therefore, the only changes are to `low` and `high`.
