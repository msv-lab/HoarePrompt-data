Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the values of `n` and `k` are returned from the function `func_1`.**

This means that the function `func_1()` has been called, and it has returned two values: `n` and `k`. The values of `n` and `k` are now known and have replaced their previous generic descriptions. The initial conditions about `n` and `k` remain valid, and the only change is that these variables now hold specific values returned by the function.
