You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case consists of two integers n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q subarray queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is equal to `i` if `a[i] > 1`, otherwise `2 * i`. The first element `b[0]` remains `0`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] >= b[y] - b[x - 1]` with `x != y`. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state after the loop has executed all its iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a subarray is good according to the given problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that there exists an array \( b \) such that the sum of elements in both arrays is equal, and all elements are different. Instead, it generates an array \( b \) where each element is either 1 or 2, which does not necessarily satisfy the conditions for a subarray to be good.

For example, consider the subarray \( [1, 2, 1, 4, 5] \) from the provided test case. The program generates an array \( b \) where each element is either 1 or 2, but it does not guarantee that the subarray can be transformed into another array \( b \) that satisfies all the conditions. For instance, the subarray from index 1 to 3 is \( [2, 1, 4] \), and the program would incorrectly determine it as "YES" because it does not check if there exists a valid \( b \) that meets all the criteria.
