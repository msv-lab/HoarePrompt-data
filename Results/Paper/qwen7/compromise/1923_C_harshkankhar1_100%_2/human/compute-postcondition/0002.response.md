Output State: **`b` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `n` is an integer obtained from input split and converted to int, `q` is an integer obtained from input split and converted to int, `t` is a positive integer, array `c` and its length `n` remain unchanged, and `q` subarray queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i` where 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n` remain unchanged; `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers obtained from input split and converted to int.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `b` with a length of `n + 1`, filled with zeros. All other variables and arrays remain unchanged from their initial states.
