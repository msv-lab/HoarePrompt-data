Functionality: **The function processes a set of inputs including an integer `n`, an integer `q`, an array `c` of length `n` containing positive integers, and `q` subarray queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. It calculates and stores cumulative sums in array `a` and a modified cumulative sum-like array `b`. For each subarray query, it determines whether the sum of elements in the subarray defined by `l_i` to `r_i` is greater than or equal to a specific value derived from `b`, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function does not return any value but prints the results of the subarray queries.**
