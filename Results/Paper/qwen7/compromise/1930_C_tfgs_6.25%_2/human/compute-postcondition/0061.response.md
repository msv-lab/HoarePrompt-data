Output State: **`cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `ans` contains the sequence starting from `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1` down to `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`, `a` and `j` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv` decrements the value of `counter[a[i - 1]]` by `adv`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
