Output State: **`ans` is a list where the last element is now the second last element minus 1, `cnt` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code appends the value of the last element of the list `ans` minus 1 to the list `ans`. Since the last element was already decreased by 1 in the initial state, the new last element is now the second last element minus 1. The condition that `cnt` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
