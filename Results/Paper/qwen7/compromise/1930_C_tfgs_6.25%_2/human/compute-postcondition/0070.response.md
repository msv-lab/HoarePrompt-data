Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(cnt)`. The only variables involved here are `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `cnt` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1. This information does not directly affect the loop condition but provides context about the state of `ans`.

4. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be greater than 0. If `cnt` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be greater than 0 for the next iteration unless the loop body changes its value. Since no specific operations on `cnt` are mentioned in the loop body, we assume `cnt` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since `cnt` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `cnt` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1, `cnt` must be greater than 0**
