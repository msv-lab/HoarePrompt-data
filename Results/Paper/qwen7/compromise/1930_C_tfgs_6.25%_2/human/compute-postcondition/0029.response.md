Output State: **`adv` is greater than 0; `i` is `n - cnt - adv`; `ans` now contains the list `[a[i - 1] - j - 1]` repeated `adv` times; `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `counter[a[i - 1]]` by `adv`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
