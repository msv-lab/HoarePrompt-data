Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and it ranges from `0` to `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - cnt - adv`.
   - `ans` now contains the list `[a[i - 1] - j - 1]` appended with `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
   - `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`, which is `(n - cnt - adv) + 1`.

4. **Adjust other relevant states**:
   - Since `i` is incremented, `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - Specifically, `ans` will append `a[i] - j - 1` to itself, where `i` is now `(n - cnt - adv) + 1`.
   - `counter[a[i]]` will be further decremented by 1, but since we are only asked to provide the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to explicitly show the decrement here.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` becomes `(n - cnt - adv) + 1`.
   - `ans` will contain the list `[a[(n - cnt - adv)] - j - 1]` appended with `a[(n - cnt - adv)] - j - 1`.
   - `counter[a[i]]` will be further decremented, but we don't need to show this explicitly in the state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n - cnt - adv + 1`, `ans` now contains the list `[a[n - cnt - adv] - j - 1]` appended with `a[n - cnt - adv] - j - 1`**
