Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `adv`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j < adv`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `adv` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - cnt` and must be greater than 0.
   - `ans` now contains `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is one less than its value in the current iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `adv`, so `j` should be incremented by 1 to become `j + 1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `adv` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `ans` is updated based on the new value of `j`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `adv` must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `i` is `n - cnt` and must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `ans` now contains `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1` (updated based on the new value of `j`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`adv` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - cnt` and must be greater than 0, `ans` now contains `a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1`**.
