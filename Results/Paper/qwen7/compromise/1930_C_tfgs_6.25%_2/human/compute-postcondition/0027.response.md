Output State: `adv` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - cnt` and must be greater than 0, `ans` now contains the list `[a[i - 1] - j - 1]` repeated `adv` times.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will contain the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, where `j` ranges from `0` to `adv - 1`. The list will have a total of `adv` elements, each being `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
