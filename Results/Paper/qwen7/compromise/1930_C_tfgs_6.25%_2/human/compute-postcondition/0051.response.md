Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a list, `cnt` is equal to `cnt - (min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]]))` if `i + 1 > 0`, `j` is equal to `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])` if `i + 1 > 0`, `ans` contains the values from `a[i] - (min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]]) + 1)` down to `a[i] - 2` if `i + 1 > 0`, and `counter[a[i + 1]]` is decreased by 1 if `i + 1 > 0`.**

This output state reflects the changes made by the code. The variable `adv` is assigned the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`. This value is used to update `cnt` and `j` if `i + 1 > 0`, and also to determine the range of values in the list `ans` if `i + 1 > 0`. The `counter[a[i + 1]]` is also decreased by 1 if `i + 1 > 0`.
