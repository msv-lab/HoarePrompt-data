Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ans` contains the sequence starting from `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1` down to `a[i - 1] - 1 - 1`, `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv`, `cnt` is decreased by `adv`, `a` and `j` remain unchanged, `ans` is appended with `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
