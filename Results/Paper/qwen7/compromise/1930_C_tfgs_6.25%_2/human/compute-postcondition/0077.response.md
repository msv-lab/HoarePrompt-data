Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a list of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of t, n, and the list a.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and for each test case, it processes an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. The exact nature of the processing and the return value for each test case is not specified in the given information.
