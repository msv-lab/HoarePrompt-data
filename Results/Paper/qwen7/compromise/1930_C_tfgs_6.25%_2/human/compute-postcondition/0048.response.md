Output State: **`i` is an integer, `ans` is a list, `ans` now contains the value `a[i]` appended to it, `cnt` is equal to `cnt - adv` if `i > 0`, `j` is equal to `adv` if `i > 0`, `ans` contains the values from `a[i - 1] - (adv + 1)` down to `a[i - 1] - 2` if `i > 0`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]` is decreased by `adv` if `i > 0`. If `i` is not greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged.**

This means that the list `ans` has had its last element appended with the value of `a[i]`. If `i` was greater than 0, then `cnt` has been decreased by `adv`, `j` has been set to `adv`, and the range of values in `ans` has been updated accordingly. The counter for `a[i - 1]` has also been decreased by `adv`. If `i` was not greater than 0, `ans` remains unchanged.
