You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

    #
    #This means that if the loop runs `n` times, the final value of `a[j]` for any valid index `j` will be the initial value of `a[j]` increased by `j + 1`. The variable `n` itself will retain its initial value, and `i` will be set to `n - 1` after the last iteration.

    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in `i` being equal to `len(a)`, `ans` containing all the elements as specified by the loop's logic, `cnt` being reduced to `0`, and `counter` having decremented the count of each element in `a` by the number of times it was appended to `ans`.
    #
    #To break it down:
    #- `i` will be `len(a)` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of the list `a`.
    #- `ans` will contain all the elements generated according to the loop's logic, which involves decrementing the count of each element in `a` and appending the appropriate values to `ans`.
    #- `cnt` will be `0` since it is decremented by `adv` each time in the loop, and `adv` is always less than or equal to `cnt`.
    #- `counter` will reflect the final counts of each element in `a` after all elements have been processed and their counts decremented accordingly.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, resulting in `i` being equal to `len(a)`, `ans` containing a sequence of decremented values starting from the initial last element of `a` and decreasing by 1 for each iteration, `cnt` being reduced to `0`, and `counter` having decremented the count of each element in `a` by the number of times it was appended to `ans`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
    #- `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`.
    #- `ans` will be a list where the initial last element of `a` is repeatedly decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
    #- `cnt` will be `0` since it is decremented with each iteration and cannot go below zero.
    #- `counter` will show the final counts of each element in `a` after all elements have been processed and their counts decremented according to the loop's logic.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: last_element_of_a last_element_of_a - 1 last_element_of_a - 2 ... 1 0 (where last_element_of_a is the last element of the list `a`)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the elements are inserted into the set `S` in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the final array `b`.

The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of the occurrences of each element in `a` after incrementing each element by its index plus one. It then converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order. However, this approach does not guarantee that the lexicographically largest possible array `b` is constructed.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
3
6 4 8
```

According to the problem description, the steps should be:
1. Select `i = 1`, insert `a_1 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7` into `S`, and delete `a_1` from `a`. Now `a = [4, 8]`.
2. Select `i = 2`, insert `a_2 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10` into `S`, and delete `a_2` from `a`. Now `a = [4]`.
3. Select `i = 1`, insert `a_1 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5` into `S`, and delete `a_1` from `a`. Now `a = []`.

Thus, `S = {10, 7, 5}` and sorting `S` in descending order gives `b = [10, 7, 5]`.

However, the program outputs `[11, 7, 6]`, which is incorrect because it does not follow the correct logic to maximize the lexicographical order of `b`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle the problem description for this input, making it incorrect.
