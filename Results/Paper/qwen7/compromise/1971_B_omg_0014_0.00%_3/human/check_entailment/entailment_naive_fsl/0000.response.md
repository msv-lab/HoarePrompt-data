Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program fails to handle cases where the string consists of exactly two distinct characters. For example, consider the input "xxxxx". According to the problem description, the program should output "NO" because no rearrangement of "xxxxx" is different from "xxxxx". However, the current implementation prints "YES" and a sorted version of the string, which is "xxxxx" itself, thus failing to meet the requirement.
