Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` generates a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times. However, this approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear as subsequences in the generated string. 

For example, consider the test case where `n=2` and `k=3`. The expected output should be a string like "abcbac" which contains all possible 2-letter combinations of "abc" as subsequences. But the current implementation would generate a string like "aaa...a" (if `k=3` and `n` is large enough), which clearly does not meet the requirement.

To solve this problem correctly, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as constructing the De Bruijn sequence for the given `k` and `n`.
