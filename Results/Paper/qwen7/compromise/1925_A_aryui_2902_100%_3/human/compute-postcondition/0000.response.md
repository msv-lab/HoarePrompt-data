Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the conditions for `t`, `n`, and `k` are updated accordingly.
