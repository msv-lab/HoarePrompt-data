### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the original assessment.

#### Original Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the sum of the friendship values for all pairs of friends multiplied by the combination of `k` taken 2 at a time (`k * (k + 1) // 2`), all modulo `MOD`.
   - This calculation does not consider the probability of each pair being chosen during the excursions.
   - The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` represents the number of ways to choose 2 excursions out of `k`, but it does not take into account the probability of each pair being chosen.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly processes the input and prints the result for each test case.

#### Original Assessment:

- **Correctness: False**
- **Explanation:** The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the probability of choosing each pair. Instead, it assumes that each pair is chosen with equal probability, which is incorrect.

- **Proposed Fix:**
  - The proposed fix uses the combination formula to calculate the probability of each pair being chosen and then multiplies it by the friendship value.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:

- The annotated code provides a clear breakdown of the program's state at key points.
- The function `func_1` indeed sums up the friendship values for all pairs of friends without considering the probability of each pair being chosen.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the expected value because it does not account for the probability of each pair being chosen.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of each pair being chosen during the excursions.
