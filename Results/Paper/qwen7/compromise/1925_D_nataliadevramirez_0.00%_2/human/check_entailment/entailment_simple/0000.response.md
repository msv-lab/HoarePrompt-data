Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the details of the pairs of friends and their friendship values.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the expected sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen for the excursions.

2. **Calculation of Expected Sum**:
   - In `func_1`, the program iterates through each pair of friends and calculates the contribution of each friendship value `f` to the total sum.
   - The formula used is `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`, which correctly accounts for the expected increase in the friendship value due to the random selection process over `k` excursions.
   - This calculation is performed for each pair of friends and the results are summed up.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required by the problem statement, ensuring that the result fits within standard integer limits.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the calculated result, which is correct according to the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program logic matches the problem description and handles the input and output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
