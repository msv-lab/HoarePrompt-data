### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Given Program Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - It iterates over each friendship and adds the product of the friendship value and a fixed term \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \) to the result.
   - The term \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \) represents the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers, which is the expected number of times each pair will be chosen if chosen equiprobably and independently.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input for each test case, including the number of children, pairs of friends, and the number of excursions.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the relevant parameters and prints the result.

#### Original Assessment:

The original assessment claims that the program does not correctly calculate the expected value because it assumes each pair is chosen with equal probability, which is incorrect. It suggests a correction by calculating the probability of each pair being chosen and using that probability to compute the expected value.

However, the original program's approach is actually correct for the problem statement. Here's why:

- The problem asks for the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- The term \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \) in the original program represents the expected number of times each pair will be chosen, assuming equiprobable and independent choices.
- This term is derived from the fact that each pair has an equal chance of being chosen in each excursion, and the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in \( k \) trials is \( k \).

Therefore, the original program's logic is correct. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the expected value by multiplying the friendship value by the expected number of times the pair will be chosen.

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the program correctly implements the logic for calculating the expected value. The term \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \) is the correct way to represent the expected number of times each pair will be chosen.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
