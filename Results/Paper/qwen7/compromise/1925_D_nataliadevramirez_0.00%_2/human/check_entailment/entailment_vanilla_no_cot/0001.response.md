### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - For each excursion, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The initial friendship value of a pair of friends is given, and we need to account for the expected increase due to being chosen in different excursions.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of friendships.
   - It iterates through each friendship and calculates the contribution to the result.
   - For each friendship, it multiplies the initial friendship value \( f \) by the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers, which is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).
   - This calculation accounts for the expected increase in the friendship value due to being chosen in different excursions.
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of children \( n \), pairs of friends \( m \), and the number of excursions \( k \).
   - It then reads the list of friendships and calls `func_1` to compute the result.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - The use of the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers is appropriate for calculating the expected increase in friendship values.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
