Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer extracted from `data[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `t`. Initially, `index` is 0, so `t` is assigned the integer value of `data[0]`. The value of `index` is incremented by 1 after this assignment, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
