Output State: **`a[i]' is assigned the value of `int(data[index])', index is incremented by 1, n' remains greater than or equal to 1, pf[i]' is calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]'**.

This means that the value of `a[i]` remains the same as before, `index` is incremented by 1, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1, and `pf[i]` is updated to the result of `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
