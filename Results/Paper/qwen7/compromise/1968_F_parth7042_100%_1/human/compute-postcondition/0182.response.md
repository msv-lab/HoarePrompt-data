Output State: **`index` is 8, `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the values `i - 1` and `i`, `a[i]` is assigned the value of `int(data[13])`, `pf[i]` is updated to `pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]**.

Explanation:
- The initial state shows that `index` is 7 more than its previous value, which means `index` is now 8.
- The line `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]` updates the value of `pf[i]` using the previous value of `pf[i - 1]` and the current value of `a[i]`.
- The value of `a[i]` is assigned the value of `int(data[5 + index])`, which translates to `int(data[13])` since `index` is now 8.
- The value of `mp[pf[i]]` remains a list containing the values `i - 1` and `i`, which are `7` and `8` respectively.
