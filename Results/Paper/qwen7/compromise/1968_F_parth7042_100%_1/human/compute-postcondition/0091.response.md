Output State: **`index` is 29, `q` is int(data[27]), `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[22]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[23]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is reassigned to `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], r) - 1`, `results` is `['NO', 'NO', 'NO']`, `pf` is `[0] * (n + 1)`, `mp` is a defaultdict(list), `mp[0]` is `[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `mp[0].append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `mp[0]`, which was initially an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged.
