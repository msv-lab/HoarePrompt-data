Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is now `x + n + 1`, `results` contains a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop, `l`, `r`, `x`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, and `it2` are updated according to the loop's logic for each iteration, and `t` is 1.**

In this step, the value of `n` is assigned the integer value from `data[index]`. The index is updated to `x + n + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
