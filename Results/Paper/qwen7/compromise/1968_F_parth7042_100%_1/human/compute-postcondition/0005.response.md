Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `_` (a dummy variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine which states need adjustment**: According to the problem, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head. The only relevant object here is `t`.

3. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the initial state**: Given that `index` is 2 and `t` is an integer extracted from `data[0]`, and `results` is an empty list, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**State: **`index` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
