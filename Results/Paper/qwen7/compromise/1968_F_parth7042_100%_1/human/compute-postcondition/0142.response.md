Output State: **`data` remains unchanged, `index` is index + 3, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `v2` is reassigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `results` now contains 'NO'**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `results` list containing 'NO', while the other variables remain as they were before the code execution.
