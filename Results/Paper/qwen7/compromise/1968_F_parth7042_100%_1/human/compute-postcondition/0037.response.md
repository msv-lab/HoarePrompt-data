Output State: **`index` is 14, `q` is 4, `x` is 0, `mp[pf[12]]` is appended with `12`, `l` is an integer value from `data[12]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[13]`, `results` contains 'YES'**

The code appends the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. Since no other variables are affected, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in the `results` list.
