The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, and no changes were made to any variables within a loop context, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement does not affect the values of `index`, `q`, `x`, `l`, `r`, `v1`, `v2`, `it1`, `it2`, and `results`.

Output State: **`index` is 17, `q` is 3, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[15]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[17]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` list now contains 'YES' appended.**
