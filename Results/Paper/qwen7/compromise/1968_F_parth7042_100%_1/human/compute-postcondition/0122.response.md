Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2, `l` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `x` is the result of `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v1` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[r]]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(v1, l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `it2` by performing a `bisect_left` operation on `v2` with `r` as the argument and then subtracting 1 from the result. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The new state of `it2` is derived from the previous values of `v2` and `r`.
