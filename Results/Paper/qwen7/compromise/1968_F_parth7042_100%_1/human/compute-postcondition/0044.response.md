Output State: **`index` is 14, `q` is 4, `x` is 0, `v2` is `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `l` is an integer value from `data[12]`, `r` is an integer value from `data[13]`, `v1` is `mp[pf[r]]`, `it1` is the index of the first occurrence of `l` in `v1` if such an occurrence exists, otherwise it is the insertion point where `l` would fit to maintain sorted order in `v1`, `it2` is `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` calculates the position where `r` would be inserted to keep `v2` sorted, subtracts 1 from it, and assigns the result to `it2`. However, without the actual values of `v2` and `r`, we cannot determine the exact value of `it2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
