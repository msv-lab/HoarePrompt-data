Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 6]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`, `results` is `['NO']`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending 'NO', it becomes `['NO']`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
