Output State: **`a[i]` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, `index` is 2 more than its previous value, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `pf[i]` is calculated as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i-1]`, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`**

Explanation:
- `a[i + 1]` was previously assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. After the code `a[i] = int(data[index])`, `a[i]` is now assigned the value of `int(data[index])`.
- `index` was previously 1 more than its previous value, so now it is 2 more than its previous value.
- `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 1.
- `pf[i + 1]` was calculated as `pf[i] ^ a[i + 1]`. Since `a[i + 1]` is no longer relevant, `pf[i]` remains as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i-1]`.
- `mp[pf[i + 1]]` was a list containing the value `i + 1`. Now, since `i + 1` is no longer relevant, `mp[pf[i]]` is a list containing the value `i`.
