The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`. Since `results` was not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending 'YES', `results` will contain ['YES']. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0, `index` is `data[index + 6]`, `a` is an empty list, `pf` is a list, `mp` is an empty dictionary, `l` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `x` is `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`, `v2` is assigned the value of `mp[pf[l - 1]]`, `it1` is the result of `bisect_left(mp[pf[l - 1]], l)`, `it2` is the result of `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1` and now `it2` is recalculated to be `bisect_left(v2, r) - 1`; `results` is ['YES']**
