Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes each test case as specified in the problem description.
2. It initializes necessary variables and data structures (`a`, `pf`, and `mp`) to store the array values, prefix XOR values, and positions where each prefix XOR value occurs.
3. For each query, it calculates the required prefix XOR values and checks if they satisfy the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.
4. The logic used to determine if a subarray is interesting is correct. Specifically, it checks if the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r-1` is zero, or if there exists a valid split point within the subarray such that the XOR of the segments is equal.
5. The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate split points is efficient and correctly implemented.
6. The final output is formatted correctly as a list of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the results of all queries.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
