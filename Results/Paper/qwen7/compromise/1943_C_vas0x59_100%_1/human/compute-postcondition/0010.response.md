Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by 2, `v` is an integer from the input decreased by 1, `u2vs[v]` contains `[u-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decreases the value of `u` by 1. Since `u` was initially an integer from the input decreased by 1, after the operation, `u` becomes an integer from the input decreased by 2. The other variables remain unchanged, so `n` must still be greater than 0, `v` remains as an integer from the input decreased by 1, and `u2vs[v]` contains `[u-1]`.
