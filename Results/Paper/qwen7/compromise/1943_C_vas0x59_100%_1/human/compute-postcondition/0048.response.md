Output State: **`ci` is the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, `d` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `previous` is the result of `bfs(a)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is the value of `-1`, `u` is an integer from the input decreased by `-2`, `v` is one less than the integer from the input decreased by `-3`, `u2vs[v]` contains all integers from `u-(-2)` to `u-1`, `path_ba` is a list containing `b` and all the values that were appended during the loop iterations until `n` became `-1`, `ops` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ci = len(path_ba) // 2` calculates the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2 and assigns it to `ci`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
