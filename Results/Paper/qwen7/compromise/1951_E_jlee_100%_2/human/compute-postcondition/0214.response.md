Postcondition: `j` is equal to `n-1`, `done` is False, `count` is 2, `count2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `t`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `x` is the first character of the list `s`. Regardless of whether the condition `n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x` is true or false, the values of `j`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `x` remain unchanged.
