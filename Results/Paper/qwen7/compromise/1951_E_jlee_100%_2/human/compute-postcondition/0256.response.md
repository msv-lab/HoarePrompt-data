Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`
- `done` is `True`
- We break out of the most internal loop or if statement
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count` is equal to `j`
- `count` is greater than 1
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`
- `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`
- The condition `(count2 == count)` is true

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`.

From the conditions, we know:
- `j` is `n-1`
- Since `n` is greater than 0, `j` is also greater than 0.
- `string[:j - 1]` will be a substring of `s` from the start up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`.
- `string[j - 1:]` will be a substring of `s` starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.

Given that `j` is `n-1`, the substrings will be:
- `string[:j - 1]` will be `s[:n-2]`
- `string[j - 1:]` will be `s[n-1:]`

Therefore, the output will be the concatenation of these two substrings.

Output: **s[:n-2] s[n-1:]**
