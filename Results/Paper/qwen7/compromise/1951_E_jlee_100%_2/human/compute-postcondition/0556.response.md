Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` (consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it processes `t` and `s` and returns a result based on the given constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. It processes these inputs according to specified constraints and returns a result for each test case.
