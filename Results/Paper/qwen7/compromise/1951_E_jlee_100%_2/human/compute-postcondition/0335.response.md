Output State: **`j` is `count + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is equal to `j`, `done` remains unchanged, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, their values remain the same as in the initial state.
