Output: **1**

Explanation: According to the initial state, `j` is defined as `count + 1`. However, the value of `count` is not explicitly given. Similarly, `n` is stated to be greater than 0 but does not affect the print statement. The print statement simply outputs the integer 1, regardless of the values of `j` and `count`. Therefore, the output is **1**.
