Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, and `count` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `done`, and `count`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified, we assume it breaks out of an implicit block, leaving the variables unchanged.
