Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `done` is True if `s[1]` is not equal to the character at index `n - 2` in string `s`.
- The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string 'YES' regardless of the conditions specified for `done`.

Since the print statement directly outputs 'YES', this is exactly what will be printed.
