Postcondition: `done` remains `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`. If `x` is not equal to the last element of the list `s`, the condition holds true, and the function does not change any of these variables or conditions.
