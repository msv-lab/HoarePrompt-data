Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` remains `False`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list representation of the input string
- `x` is the first element of the list `s`
- `count` is 0
- `count2` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the other variables and objects mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
