Output State: **`done` is False, `count` remains unchanged, `count2` is 0.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. The `done` variable stays as `False`, `count` remains unchanged, and `count2` stays at 0.
