Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is assigned the value of `count`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`.
- `done` is `True`.
- The most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`.

Let's break it down:

1. `string[:j - 1]` will give us the substring of `s` from the start up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`.
2. `string[j - 1:]` will give us the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.

Given that `j` is assigned the value of `count`, and considering the conditions provided, the most relevant piece of information is that the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`. This implies that `j` is the point where the string does not match its mirrored counterpart.

However, since the exact value of `j` and the content of `s` are not explicitly given, we can only describe the substrings in terms of `j` and `s`.

Output: **s[:j - 1], s[j - 1:]**
