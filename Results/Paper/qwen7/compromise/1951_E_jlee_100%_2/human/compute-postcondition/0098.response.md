Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is greater than 0, and either the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, in which case `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is greater than 1, then `done` equals `True` when `count2` is less than `count`, and `done` remains `False` when `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is less than 1, then `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 1, and either the character at index `j` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, in which case `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or `count` is less than 1.
