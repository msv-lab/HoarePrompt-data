Postcondition: `done` is `True` if the character at index `j` in the list `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` and `count` is less than 1; otherwise, `done` is `False` and `count` is equal to `j`. Additionally, if the else part is executed, `done` is `False`, `count` remains unchanged, and `count2` is incremented by 1.
