Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`. Additionally, if `count` is greater than 1, then `done` equals `True` if `count2` equals `count`; otherwise, `done` remains `False` if `count2` is greater than `count`.
