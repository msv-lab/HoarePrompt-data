Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` remains `False`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list representation of the input string
- `x` is the first element of the list `s`

The condition states that if `x` is not equal to the last element of the list `s`, the condition holds true. However, the print statement simply outputs `'NO'`.

Given this, the print statement will execute and print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
