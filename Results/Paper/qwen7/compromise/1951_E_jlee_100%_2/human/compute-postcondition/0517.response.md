Output State: **`done` is `True`, `count` is equal to `j`, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `done`, `count`, `s`, and the condition regarding the characters in the string, these variables retain their initial values.
