Postcondition: `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, `done` is `True`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. This holds whether `count2` is less than `count`, equal to `count`, or greater than `count`.
