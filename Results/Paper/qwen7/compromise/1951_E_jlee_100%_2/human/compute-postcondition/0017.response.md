Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing characters from `string`, `n` is the length of list `s`, `x` is the first character of list `s`, and `done` is False. If `x` is not equal to the last character of list `s`, we continue the loop or statement we were inside.
