Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` remains `False` (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is `n-1` (though the value of `n` is not specified, it does not affect the print statement).
- `string` is an input string (the actual content of the string is not provided but is considered as the input string).
- `s` is a list representation of the input string (so `s` contains characters from the input string).
- `x` is the first element of the list `s` (which means `x` is the first character of the input string).

The print statement is:
```python
print(string)
```

This statement will print the input string as it is.

Output: **string (where string is the input string)**
