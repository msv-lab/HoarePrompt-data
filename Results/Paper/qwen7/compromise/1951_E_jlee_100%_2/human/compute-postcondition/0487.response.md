Output State: **`done` is `True`, `count` is less than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `done` and `count`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of the fact that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
