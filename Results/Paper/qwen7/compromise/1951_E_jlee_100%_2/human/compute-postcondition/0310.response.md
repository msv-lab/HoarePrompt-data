Postcondition: `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, `done` is `True`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If `count > 1`, then the process breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count2` is set to 0, and the same conditions as the precondition hold.
