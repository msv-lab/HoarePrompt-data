Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `done` is True
- `count` is 2
- `count2` is 0

We need to determine what will be printed by the following code snippet:

```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

Given that `j` is 2, the slice `string[:j]` will take the first 2 characters of the string `string`. The slice `string[j:]` will take the rest of the string starting from the 3rd character (index 2).

Therefore, the output will be the first 2 characters of the string followed by the remaining part of the string.

Output: **string[:2] string[2:]**
