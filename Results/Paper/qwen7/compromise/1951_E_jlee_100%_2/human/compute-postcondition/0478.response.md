Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` becomes `True` if the character at index `j` in the list `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` and `count` is less than 1; otherwise, `done` remains `False` and `count` is equal to `j`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of `done` and `count` do not affect this print statement because it is printing a hardcoded string.

Output: **YES**
