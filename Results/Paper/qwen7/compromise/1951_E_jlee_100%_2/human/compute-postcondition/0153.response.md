Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, `count` is 2, `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. In this case, since no loop was specified, the variables `j`, `n`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged. The condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement based on `s[2]` not being equal to `s[n - 3]` is also unaffected by the `continue` statement.
