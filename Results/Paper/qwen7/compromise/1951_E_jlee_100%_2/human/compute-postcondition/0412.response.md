Postcondition: `done` remains `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and if at any point `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is set to `True`. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1.
