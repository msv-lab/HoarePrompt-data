Output: **YES**

Explanation: Based on the initial state provided:
- `j` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The character at index `j` (which is 0) in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` (which is `n - 1` since `j` is 0).

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`, regardless of the specific values of `s`, `n`, and the characters at the specified indices. Since the condition about the characters being unequal does not affect the print statement itself, the output remains `'YES'`.
