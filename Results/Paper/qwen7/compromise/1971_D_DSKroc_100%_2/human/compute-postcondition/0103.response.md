Based on the initial state provided:

- `count` is explicitly given as 3.
- `flag` is explicitly given as 0.
- `q` is the length of `s`.
- `i` is `len(s) - 2`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(count + 1)
```

Given that `count` is 3, the expression `count + 1` evaluates to 4.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **4**
