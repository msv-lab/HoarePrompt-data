Based on the initial state provided:

- `count` is the number of times the condition `int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1])` was true throughout the loop's execution.
- `flag` is 0.
- `q` is `len(s) - 1`.
- `i` is -1.

The expression `count + 1` will be evaluated and printed. Since `count` is the number of times the condition `int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1])` was true, and `i` is initialized to -1, the condition `int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1])` cannot be checked because `i` is out of the bounds of the string `s` (assuming `s` is a non-empty string).

Therefore, `count` remains 0, and `count + 1` evaluates to 1.

Output: **1**
