Postcondition: `count` is 1, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `q` is the length of `s`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `int(s[i])` is not equal to the current value of `int(s[i + 1])`. If the current value of `int(s[i])` is lower than the current value of `int(s[i + 1])`, then `flag` is set to 1. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0.
