Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string consists entirely of '1's or entirely of '0's correctly. For such strings, the program will incorrectly output `count + 1`, which is more than necessary. Specifically, for the input `"11111"`, the program outputs `5` instead of `1`. This is because the `flag` variable is never set to `1` in this case, and `count` is equal to `4` (since there are 4 transitions from one character to another), leading to `count + 1` being printed.
