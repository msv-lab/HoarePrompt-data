The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. It counts the number of adjacent character pairs in `s` where the characters are not equal when converted to integers. If there is at least one instance where the current character is less than the next character in `s`, it subtracts one from the count before printing the result. Otherwise, it prints the count as is. The function implicitly takes input values for `t` and `s` for each test case and outputs the result for each case.
