Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time matches the problem statement.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem asks for the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes, and from the second installation every `b` minutes. Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight is that fireworks launched at the same time from different installations do not overlap their visibility period unless they are launched exactly `lcm(a, b)` minutes apart. However, the problem simplifies this by considering the visibility period `m` and the frequency of launches `a` and `b`.

3. **Formula Analysis**:
   - If `m < a` or `m < b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2. This is because the visibility period is shorter than the interval between launches, meaning at most one firework from each installation can be visible at any given time.
   - Otherwise, the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is used. Here, `m // a` gives the number of fireworks from the first installation that can be visible within the `m`-minute window, and `m // b` gives the number of fireworks from the second installation. Adding 2 accounts for the possibility of fireworks from both installations being visible at the same time.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `m < a` or `m < b`, the logic correctly outputs 2.
   - When `m >= a` and `m >= b`, the logic also correctly calculates the number of fireworks visible using the given formula.

Given the analysis, the provided logic in the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
