Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. According to the problem description, the visibility of fireworks is determined by their launch times and the duration they remain visible. The current implementation simply calculates the number of multiples of `a` and `b` up to `m`, which does not account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched at different times.

For example, consider the input `(a=7, b=8, m=56)`:
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched at times `[7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56]`.
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched at times `[8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56]`.

According to the problem, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 17, but the program incorrectly prints 14 because it only counts the multiples of `a` and `b` up to `m` without considering the overlapping visibility periods.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the overlapping intervals of visibility for fireworks launched at different times. This requires a more complex algorithm that takes into account the actual intervals of visibility, which is not implemented in the current solution.
