The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(t\), \(a\), and \(m\). For each test case, it reads the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) from the input. If \(m\) is less than either \(a\) or \(b\), it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints the value of \(\frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2\). After processing all test cases, it outputs a list of these printed integers, one for each test case.
