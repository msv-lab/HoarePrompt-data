You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: After all iterations, `ans` will be the minimum value between the final accumulated value of `ans + y` and `n - 2`, and `y` will be 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates a value `ans` based on specific conditions involving these integers and the distances between them. Finally, it prints the minimum value between `ans + y` and `n - 2`, ensuring `y` is reduced accordingly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the chosen vertices are consecutive. For instance, consider the following input:

```
4 2 2
1 3
```

In this case, the program should be able to add two more vertices to form two triangles, resulting in a total of 2 triangles. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of triangles. 

Let's analyze the program's logic:

1. It calculates `ans = x + y - 2`, which is the minimum number of triangles that can be formed without considering additional vertices.
2. It then checks the gaps between the chosen vertices and adds to `ans` based on these gaps.
3. Finally, it tries to add more triangles using the remaining `y` vertices.

However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the chosen vertices are consecutive. For example, if the chosen vertices are 1 and 3, the gap between them is 2, and the program should be able to add two more vertices (2 and 4) to form two triangles. But the program does not account for this scenario properly.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly handles consecutive vertices and adds the maximum number of triangles possible.
