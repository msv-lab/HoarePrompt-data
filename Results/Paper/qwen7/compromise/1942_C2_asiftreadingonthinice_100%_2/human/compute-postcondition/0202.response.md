Output State: **`tmp` is a list of integers that does not contain the previous value of `i`, `i` is the next element in the updated `tmp` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `i` was being added to `tmp`. The values of `tmp` and `i` remain as they were before the `break` statement, with the condition that `tmp` does not contain the previous value of `i` and `i` is the next element intended to be added to `tmp`.
