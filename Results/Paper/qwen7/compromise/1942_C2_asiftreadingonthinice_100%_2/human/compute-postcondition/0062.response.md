Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in tmp`. The variables involved here are `i` and `tmp`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that `tmp` is a non-empty list with a specific length (`len(tmp) - 1`), and `y` is an integer. Depending on the value of `y` relative to `i - 1`, either `ans` is updated or the loop breaks.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is being iterated over from the list `tmp`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `tmp`.
   - The length of `tmp` remains the same unless the list is modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, the length of `tmp` stays the same.
   - `y` and `ans` are not directly modified by the loop itself but depend on the condition inside the loop. Therefore, their values remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the only variable that changes is `i`, which will be the next element in `tmp`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with length `len(tmp) - 1`, `y` is an integer, `i` is the next element in `tmp`**.
