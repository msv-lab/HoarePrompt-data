Output State: **`i` is 4, `len(a)` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 if `a[2] - a[1] == 2`, otherwise `tmp` is `[1]` (since `(a[4] - a[3]) // 2` is calculated and appended to `tmp`).**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `i` being 4, `len(a)` being greater than 1, and `ans` being 1 if `a[2] - a[1] == 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` contains an element which is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`, or no new variable `tmp` is defined if the condition is not met.
- The code snippet `tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)` appends the value of `(a[4] - a[3]) // 2` to `tmp`.
- Since `i` is 4, the expression `(a[4] - a[3]) // 2` is evaluated and appended to `tmp`.
- Therefore, `tmp` now contains `[1]` (assuming the subtraction and division operations yield 1).
- The other variables (`i`, `len(a)`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
