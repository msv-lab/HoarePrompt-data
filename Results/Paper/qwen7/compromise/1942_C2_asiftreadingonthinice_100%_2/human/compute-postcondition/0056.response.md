Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `tmp` is a non-empty list.
- `y` is an integer.
- The postcondition specifies how `y` and `ans` change based on the value of `y` relative to `i - 1`.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in tmp:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `tmp` is not empty and there are elements left to iterate over.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `tmp` is a non-empty list.
   - `y` is an integer.
   
2. **Effect of the Loop**:
   - For each `i` in `tmp`, the loop body is executed.
   - The loop body modifies `y` and `ans` based on the condition `y >= i - 1`.

3. **State Adjustment**:
   - After the loop iterates over one element `i` from `tmp`, `tmp` will have one less element (since it is being iterated over).
   - The value of `i` will be the current element from `tmp`.
   - `y` and `ans` will be modified according to the loop body, but since the exact modifications are not specified, we only need to ensure `tmp` is updated correctly.

### Updated State:
- Since `i` is the current element from `tmp`, after one iteration, `tmp` will have one less element.
- Therefore, `tmp` must now be a non-empty list with one less element than before.

### Final State:
- `tmp` is a non-empty list with one less element than before.
- `y` and `ans` remain as they were after the loop body execution, but we don't know the exact values without the loop body details.

### Conclusion:
State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with one less element than before, `y` is an integer, and `ans` is updated based on the loop body execution.**

However, since we need to provide a specific state adjustment, we focus on the key variable `tmp`:

State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with one less element than before, `y` is an integer, and `ans` is updated based on the loop body execution.**

For clarity, let's denote the new length of `tmp` as `len(tmp) - 1`:

State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with length `len(tmp) - 1`, `y` is an integer, and `ans` is updated based on the loop body execution.**
