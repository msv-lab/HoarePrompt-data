Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each occurrence where `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` for all `i` in the range of 1 to `len(a) - 1`. Additionally, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, and `ans` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `i` is still equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1, and `tmp` still contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each occurrence where `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` for all `i` in the range of 1 to `len(a) - 1`. Additionally, `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` still equals 2.
