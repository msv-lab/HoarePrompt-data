Output State: **`tmp` must contain the appropriate values based on the conditions described, and `y` is less than `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `tmp` or `y` but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the conditions and values of `tmp` and `y` remain unchanged, and the program exits the loop or conditional block it was in.
