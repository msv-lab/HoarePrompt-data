Output State: **`tmp` is an empty list, `y` is an integer, `ans` is the final accumulated value of `ans + y`.**

The code `ans += y` updates the value of `ans` by adding the current value of `y` to it. Since `y` is an integer, `ans` is updated to reflect this addition. The values of `tmp` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
