Postcondition: `tmp` is a list of integers, `i` is the next element in `tmp` (if it exists). If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is decreased by `i - 1` and `ans` is increased by `i`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, then `y` remains unchanged and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
