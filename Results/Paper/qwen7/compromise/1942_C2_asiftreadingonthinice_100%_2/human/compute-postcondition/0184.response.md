Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `a`, `ans` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence where `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, and `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each occurrence where `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` for all `i` in the range of 1 to `len(a) - 1`. Additionally, if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` now includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even and not equal to 2; `tmp` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `tmp`. Sorting does not change the values of the elements in `tmp`, but it changes their order. All other variables (`i`, `ans`, `a`, `n`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state retains the same conditions as before, except that `tmp` is now sorted.
