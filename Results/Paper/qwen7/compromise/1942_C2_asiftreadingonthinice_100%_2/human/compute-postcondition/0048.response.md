Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in tmp:`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the elements of `tmp`, the initial value of `i` can be any element from `tmp`. However, since we are starting the loop, we need to ensure that `tmp` is not empty.

3. **Check the Initial State of `tmp`**: The problem states that `tmp` is sorted and contains all the values added to it whenever the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` was met. Additionally, if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` includes the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. Therefore, `tmp` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `tmp` is not empty. Since `tmp` is sorted and contains values based on certain conditions, we can state that `tmp` must be a non-empty list.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `tmp` must be a non-empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tmp` must be a non-empty list**
