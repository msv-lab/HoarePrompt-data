Postcondition: `tmp` is a non-empty list, `y` is an integer that has been adjusted based on its original value and `i - 1`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is set to its original value minus `(i - 1)`, and `ans` is incremented by `i`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, then the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
