Output State: **`l` is equal to `r - 2`, `r` is `n - 3`, `st` is the total number of consecutive duplicates found, `end` is still 0, and `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was equal to `n - 2`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 3`. The other variables (`l`, `st`, `end`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
