To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to make sure that both conditions in the loop head are satisfied:

1. `r > l`: This condition ensures that the range `[l, r)` is non-empty.
2. `a[r] == a[r - 1]`: This condition ensures that the element at index `r` is equal to the element at index `r - 1`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `l` is equal to `r`
- `r` is `n - 1`
- `st` is the total number of consecutive duplicates found
- `end` is still 0
- `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0

We need to adjust the states of `l` and `r` to satisfy the loop conditions:

1. Since `l` is equal to `r` and `r` is `n - 1`, the condition `r > l` will be false initially because `l` and `r` are the same.
2. To make `r > l` true, we need to decrement `r` by 1, making `r` equal to `n - 2` and `l` still equal to `r - 1`.

After adjusting `r` to `n - 2`, we need to check the second condition `a[r] == a[r - 1]`:
- `a[r]` is `a[n - 2]`
- `a[r - 1]` is `a[n - 3]`

If `a[n - 2]` is equal to `a[n - 3]`, then the loop can execute the first time. Otherwise, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `r`.

State: **`l` is equal to `r - 1`, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is the total number of consecutive duplicates found, `end` is still 0, and `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0**
