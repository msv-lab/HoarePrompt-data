Output State: **`l` is 3, `r` must be greater than 2, `a[2]` must be equal to `a[3]`, `st` is 1.**

The code `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Given that `st` was initially unspecified in the context provided, it is reasonable to assume it started as 0. After the increment, `st` becomes 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
