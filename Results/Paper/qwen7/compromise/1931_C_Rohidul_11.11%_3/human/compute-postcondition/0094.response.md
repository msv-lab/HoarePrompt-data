Output State: `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is the total number of consecutive duplicates found, `end` is still 0, and `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l < r` and the element at index `l` is equal to the element at index `l + 1`. After each iteration, `l` is incremented by 1 and `st` (which counts the number of consecutive duplicates) is incremented. The loop terminates when `l` is no longer less than `r`. At this point, `l` will be equal to `r` because the condition `l < r` becomes false. The value of `st` will be the total count of consecutive duplicates found during the loop's execution. The values of `end` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
