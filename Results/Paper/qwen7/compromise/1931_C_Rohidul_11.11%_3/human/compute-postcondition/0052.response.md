Output State: **`l` is 4, `r` must be greater than 3, `a[3]` must be equal to `a[4]`, `st` is 1**.

The code `st += 1` increments the value of `st` by 1. Since `st` was initially not specified, we assume it was 0 (as it is common for uninitialized variables to start at 0). After the increment, `st` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
