Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns information or a result based on the given test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t`, `n`, and a list `a`. For each test case, the function processes these inputs without accepting them as parameters directly within its definition. Instead, it likely iterates over the test cases and performs operations based on the provided `t`, `n`, and list `a`, returning a result specific to each test case.
