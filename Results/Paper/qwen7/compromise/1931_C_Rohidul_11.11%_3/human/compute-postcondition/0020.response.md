Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `r` is decreased by 1.
   - `st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list.
   - `end` is 1.
   - `l` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - `a[n - 2]` must be equal to `a[n - 1]`.

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition involves `r`, `l`, and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`.
   - We need to ensure that `r > l` and `a[r] == a[r - 1]` are true for the next iteration.

4. **Analyze each state**:
   - `r` is decreased by 1 in the previous iteration, so `r` is now one less than its value at the start of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `r` must still be greater than `l`. Since `l` must be less than `n - 1` and `a[n - 2]` must be equal to `a[n - 1]`, `l` is likely close to `r` but less than `r` (because `r` was just decreased).
   - `a[r] == a[r - 1]` should hold true for the next iteration, meaning `a[r]` should be equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `r` must be greater than `l` for the loop to continue. Since `r` was just decreased by 1, `r` should be one more than its value at the start of the previous iteration.
   - `l` must be less than `n - 1` and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `r` must be greater than `l` (one more than its value at the start of the previous iteration).
- `l` must be less than `n - 1`.
- `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration.

State: **`r` must be greater than `l` (one more than its value at the start of the previous iteration), `l` must be less than `n - 1`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration**.
