Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is either 4 or 0, `end` is either 4 or 0, `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input split.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `0` to `l` and the value `n - 1` to `r`. The values of `st`, `end`, `ans`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
