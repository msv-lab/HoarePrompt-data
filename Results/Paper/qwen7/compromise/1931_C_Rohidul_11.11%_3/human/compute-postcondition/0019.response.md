Output State: **`r` is decreased by 1, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is 1, `l` must be less than `n - 1`, and `a[n - 2]` must be equal to `a[n - 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `end` is incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
