Output State: **`l` is equal to `r - 2`, `r` is `n - 3`, `st` is the total number of consecutive duplicates found, `end` is 1, and `ans` is the length of list `a` minus 1 if `a[0] == a[-1]`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `end` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables (`l`, `r`, `st`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
