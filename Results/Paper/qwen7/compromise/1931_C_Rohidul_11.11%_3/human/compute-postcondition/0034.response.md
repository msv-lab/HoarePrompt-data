Output State: **`ans` is `n - 1 - l`, `st` is equal to the number of consecutive identical elements at the beginning of the list, `end` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `l` is the index right after the last pair of identical elements found, and `r` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans = r - l` calculates the difference between `r` and `l` and assigns it to `ans`. Given that `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` becomes `n - 1 - l`. The values of `st`, `end`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
