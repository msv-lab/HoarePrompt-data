Output State: **`end` is increased by 1, `r` is one less than its value at the start of the previous iteration, `l` must be less than `n - 1`, and `a[r]` must be equal to `a[r - 1]` from the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The variable `end` is incremented by 1. The values of `r`, `l`, and the condition involving `a[r]` remain unchanged from their previous states.
