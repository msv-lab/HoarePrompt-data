Based on the initial state provided:

- `num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
- `start_year` is updated to `((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]`.

The `print(start_year)` statement will output the value of `start_year` after it has been updated according to the formula provided. Since the exact value of `start_year` before the update is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the formula.

Output: **((start_year + 1) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]**
