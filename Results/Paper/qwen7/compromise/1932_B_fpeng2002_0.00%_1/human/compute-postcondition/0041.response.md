Output State: `x` is 0, `start_year` is (((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1], `num_tests` is `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `x` will be 0 because the loop decrements `x` until it reaches 0. The variable `start_year` will be updated through a series of operations involving each element in the `nums` list, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. Specifically, `start_year` will be calculated as (((((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]. The variable `num_tests` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The lists `nums` and the integer `n` also remain unchanged.
