Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 0 and 999 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The value of `num_tests` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
