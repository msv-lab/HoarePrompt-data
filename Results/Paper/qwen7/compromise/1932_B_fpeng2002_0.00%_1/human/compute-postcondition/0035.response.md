Output State: **`x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`, `start_year` is `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `start_year` to `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given that `start_year` was initially 0 and `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, the updated value of `start_year` is calculated as `((0 + 1) // nums[len(nums) - 1] + 1) * nums[len(nums) - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
