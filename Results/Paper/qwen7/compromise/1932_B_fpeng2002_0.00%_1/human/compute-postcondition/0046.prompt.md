You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 0, `start_year` is (((((...(((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]) + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2] ... // nums[len(nums)-2] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-2]) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1], `num_tests` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `x` will be 0 because the loop decrements `x` until it reaches 0. The variable `start_year` will be updated through a series of operations involving each element in the `nums` list, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. Specifically, `start_year` will be calculated as (((((...(((start_year + 1) // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]) + 1) // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]) + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2] ... // nums[len(nums)-2] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-2]) // nums[len(nums)-1] + 1) * nums[len(nums)-1]. The variable `num_tests` will be 0 because the loop decrements `num_tests` by 1 in each iteration until it becomes 0. The lists `nums` and the integer `n` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of subsequent test cases, followed by t pairs of integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of n and the sequence a_i.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
