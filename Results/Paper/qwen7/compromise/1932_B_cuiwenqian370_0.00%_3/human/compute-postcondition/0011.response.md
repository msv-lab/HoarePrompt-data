Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (number of test cases), followed by an integer `n` (number of signs), and then `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (periodicities of the signs). For each test case, it determines the least common multiple (LCM) of the given periodicities and returns the LCM for each test case.**

Note: The actual computation of the LCM is not described here, only the parameters and expected behavior of the function.
