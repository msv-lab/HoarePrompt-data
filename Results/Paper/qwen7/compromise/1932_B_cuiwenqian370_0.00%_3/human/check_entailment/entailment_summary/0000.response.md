Reasoning:
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` is designed to process a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters and compute a dynamic programming solution. However, this function does not match the requirements of the problem statement at all. The problem requires finding the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse occurs, but `func_1` is unrelated to this task.
- `func_2` is supposed to read input and process multiple test cases. It reads the input, extracts the necessary data, and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, since `func_1` is not correctly implemented for the problem, it will not produce the correct results.
- Given that `func_1` is completely unrelated to the problem and `func_2` relies on it, the overall program cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**
