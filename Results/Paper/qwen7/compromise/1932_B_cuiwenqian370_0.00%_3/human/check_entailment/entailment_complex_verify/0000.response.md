### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not match the problem description. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to process a string consisting of `@` and `*` characters. It calculates some kind of dynamic programming solution, but it is not related to the problem of finding the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur.
   - The function does not use the periodicities of the signs at all, and instead, it seems to be solving a different problem involving sequences of `@` and `*`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, as mentioned, `func_1` is not relevant to the problem.
   - Even if we were to modify `func_1` to be relevant, the overall structure of the code still does not solve the problem correctly because it does not handle the periodicities of the signs.

Given that the problem requires calculating the year in which all \(n\) signs will occur based on their periodicities, neither function in the provided code addresses this requirement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the required functionality to find the year in which all signs of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicities.
