Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a test case where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. The function returns information based on the comparison of x and y for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t`, and for each `t`, it expects two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y`. However, since the function definition provided does not include parameters `x`, `y`, or `t`, the function's actual implementation details are not reflected in the parameter list. Instead, the functionality describes the expected input and output behavior based on the given constraints.
