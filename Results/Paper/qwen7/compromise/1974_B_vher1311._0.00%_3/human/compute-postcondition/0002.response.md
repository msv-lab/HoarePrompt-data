State: **`i` is 0, `j` is len(`unique_chars`) - 1, `s` must be a non-empty string and contain unique_chars**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `char` is derived from iterating over the string `s`.
2. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string because if `s` is empty, there are no characters to iterate over, and the loop will not execute.
3. The initial values of `i` and `j` are given as `0` and `len(unique_chars) - 1`, respectively. These variables are not directly used in the loop condition but are part of the initial state.
4. Since `unique_chars` is referenced in the initial value of `j`, it implies that `unique_chars` must exist and be a valid list or sequence.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `s` is a non-empty string containing the characters from `unique_chars`, and the initial values of `i` and `j` are correctly set.
