Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is len(`unique_chars`) - 1**.

This means that the variables `i` and `j` have been initialized with the values 0 and `len(unique_chars) - 1`, respectively. The initial state of `s` being a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and `unique_chars` being a list of unique characters from `s` sorted in ascending order remains unchanged.
