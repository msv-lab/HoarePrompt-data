Output State: **i is 0, j is -1.**

Explanation: After iterating through all characters in `s`, the variable `i` will always be 0 because we only increment `i` when a new character is inserted into `unique_chars`, and since `unique_chars` starts empty, `i` will never be incremented. The variable `j` will be decremented for each character found in `unique_chars` and will eventually become -1 after all characters in `s` have been processed.
