Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. The function `func_1` attempts to decode the string but does not follow the required steps. Specifically, the function tries to replace characters in the encoded string with characters from a sorted list of unique characters, which is not the correct approach for decoding.

To correctly decode the string, we need to map each character in the encoded string back to its original character based on the position of the character in the sorted list of unique characters. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode_string(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

In this corrected version, we create a mapping from each unique character to its corresponding symmetric character from the end of the sorted list of unique characters. Then, we use this mapping to decode the encoded string. This approach ensures that the original string is correctly restored.
