Output State: **`cx` is a non-empty set, `i` is an element of `cx`, and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`; `tmp` is equal to the original value of `tmp` plus 1.**

The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since `tmp` was not initialized or given a specific value in the initial state, we assume it had some initial value before this line of code was executed. After executing the code, `tmp` is updated to its original value plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
