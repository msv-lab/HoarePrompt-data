Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `cx` is a set containing `x`; `ax` is either 1000000007 or min(`x`, 1000000007); `bx` is -1; `a` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was either an empty set or a set containing `x`, adding `x` again does not change the fact that `cx` contains `x`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
