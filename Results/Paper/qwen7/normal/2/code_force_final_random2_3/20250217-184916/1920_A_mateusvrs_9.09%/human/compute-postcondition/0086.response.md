Output State: **`bx` is the maximum of `x` and `bx`, `n` must be greater than 1, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum between the current value of `bx` and the value of `x`. The other variables (`n`, `cx`, `ax`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
