Postcondition: `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1, `i` is the next element in `cx`, and `tmp` is increased by 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, the condition is met and no further changes occur. If the condition is not met, the values of `cx`, `i`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from the precondition.
