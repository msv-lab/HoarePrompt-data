Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cx` is a set containing `x`.**

Explanation: The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `x` was previously assigned the value of the second integer entered, it is now added to the set `cx`. The values of `n`, `a`, and the condition that `a` is an input integer remain unchanged.
