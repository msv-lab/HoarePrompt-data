Postcondition: `cx` is a non-empty set, `i` is the first element in `cx`, and `tmp` is the value of `tmp` after the previous iteration plus 1. If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, the condition remains unchanged. If the condition is not met, the condition also remains unchanged.
