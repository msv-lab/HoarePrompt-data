Output State: `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` where `a` is not equal to 1, `n` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` is not equal to 1, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` where `a` is equal to 2, and `a` and `x` are the last integer inputs provided during the loop's final iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `bx` will hold the highest `x` value when `a` was not 1.
- `n` will be the total number of iterations the loop ran.
- `cx` will be a set of all distinct `x` values where `a` was not 1.
- `ax` will be the smallest `x` value when `a` was 2.
- `a` and `x` will be the values of the last input provided during the loop's final iteration.
