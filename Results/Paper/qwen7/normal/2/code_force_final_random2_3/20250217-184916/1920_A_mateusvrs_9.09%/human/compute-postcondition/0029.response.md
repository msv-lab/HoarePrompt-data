Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing `x`, `ax` is either 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is either -1 or max(`x`, -1), `a` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. The initial conditions for `cx`, `ax`, and `bx` remain unchanged because these variables are not affected by the input operation. The value of `n` remains greater than 0 as per the initial condition.
