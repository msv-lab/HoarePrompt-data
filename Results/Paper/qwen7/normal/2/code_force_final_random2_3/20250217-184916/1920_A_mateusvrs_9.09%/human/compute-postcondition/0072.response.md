Output State: **`bx` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cx` is a set containing `x`, `ax` is 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is not equal to 2**.

Explanation: The code adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `cx` was initially an empty set, after executing `cx.add(x)`, `cx` now contains the single element `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
