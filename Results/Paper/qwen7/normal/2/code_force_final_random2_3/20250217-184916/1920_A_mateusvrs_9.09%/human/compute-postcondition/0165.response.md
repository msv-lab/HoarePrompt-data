Postcondition: `tmp` is 2, `n` is the total number of iterations performed, `a` is the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `x` is the last integer input provided during the loop's final iteration, `ax` is the smallest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest integer input provided as `x` when `a` was 1, `cx` is a set containing all integers provided as `x` when `a` was neither 1 nor 2 and must have at least one element (with the current value of `i` removed), and the new value of `i` is the next element in `cx` that satisfies the condition `i >= bx` and `i <= ax`.
