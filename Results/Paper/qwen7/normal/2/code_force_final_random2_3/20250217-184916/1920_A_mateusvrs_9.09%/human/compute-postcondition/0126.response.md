Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is 2, `x` is an integer from the input, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 2.**

Explanation: The line `ax = min(x, ax)` sets `ax` to the smaller of the current values of `x` and `ax`. Given that `ax` was initially `a` and `a` is 2, `ax` will be updated to the minimum of `x` and 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
