Output State: **`bx` is -1, `n` must be greater than 1, `cx` is a set containing `x` if `a` is not equal to 1, otherwise `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000000, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ax` to be the minimum of the current value of `x` and the previous value of `ax`. The other variables remain unchanged.
