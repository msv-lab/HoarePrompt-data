Output State: **`cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `tmp` is increased by 1.**

The code `tmp += 1` increments the value of `tmp` by 1. Since `cx` and `i` were not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, `cx` is still a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was not 1, and `i` is still the next element in `cx`. The value of `tmp` is increased by 1.
