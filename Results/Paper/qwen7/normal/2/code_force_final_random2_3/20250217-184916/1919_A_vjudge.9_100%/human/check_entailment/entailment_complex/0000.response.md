Reasoning:
The given solution checks whether the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. Based on this check, it determines the winner of the game. However, the logic provided in the solution does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy for the game as described in the problem statement. The key issue lies in the misunderstanding of the game rules and the optimal strategy.

According to the problem, the game involves a series of moves where players can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet. The crucial insight is that the player who faces a situation where both wallets have zero coins loses. Therefore, the optimal strategy involves ensuring that the opponent is forced into a losing position.

In the given solution, the logic only considers the parity (even or odd nature) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. This approach does not account for the sequence of moves and the ability to force the opponent into a losing position through strategic swapping and removing coins.

Given the correct optimal strategy, the player who starts with an odd number of coins in the combined wallets (i.e., \(a + b\) is odd) can always force the opponent into a losing position. This is because the player can always ensure that after their turn, the total number of coins in both wallets remains odd, thereby forcing the opponent to eventually face a situation where both wallets have zero coins.

Therefore, the correct logic should be:
- If \(a + b\) is odd, Alice wins.
- If \(a + b\) is even, Bob wins.

However, the provided solution incorrectly uses the parity of the absolute difference instead of the sum.

Given this analysis, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
