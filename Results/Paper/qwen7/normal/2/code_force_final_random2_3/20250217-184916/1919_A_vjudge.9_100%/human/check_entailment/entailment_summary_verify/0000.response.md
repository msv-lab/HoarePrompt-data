### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program in detail.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing one coin from their respective wallets until one player cannot make a valid move.
- The key point is that the player who is forced to have zero coins in their wallet loses.
- The optimal strategy involves ensuring that the opponent is left with a non-zero number of coins after each move.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads multiple pairs of integers \(a\) and \(b\) representing the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively.
- It then checks if the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is even or odd.
- If the difference is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

#### Function Summary:
- The function reads pairs of integers, checks the parity of the difference between these integers, and prints "Bob" or "Alice" based on the result.

#### Counterexample:
- Consider the test case where Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 1 coin.
  - Initially, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\).
  - The absolute difference is \(|1 - 1| = 0\), which is even.
  - According to the program, "Bob" is printed.
  - However, according to the game rules, Alice should win because she can force Bob into a losing position by removing her coin, leaving Bob with 0 coins.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The program incorrectly determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between \(a\) and \(b\).
- The game logic requires a different approach to determine the winner, not just the parity of the difference.

#### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach would involve simulating the game or analyzing the parity of the total number of coins.
- If the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) can always mirror the first player's (Alice's) moves, ensuring that the first player is eventually forced to lose.
- If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) can force the second player into a losing position.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and thus is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
