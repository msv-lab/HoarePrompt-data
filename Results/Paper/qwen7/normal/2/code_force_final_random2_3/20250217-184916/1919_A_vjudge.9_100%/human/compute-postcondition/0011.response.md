Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `t`.
3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is an integer from the input.
   - `b` is an integer from the input.
   - The absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd after the if-else block executes.

4. **Adjusting the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `i` will be `i + 1` and should still be less than `t`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `t` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop head.
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `i + 1`.
- The condition for the absolute difference between `a` and `b` being even or odd does not change with the loop iteration.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is either even or odd**.
