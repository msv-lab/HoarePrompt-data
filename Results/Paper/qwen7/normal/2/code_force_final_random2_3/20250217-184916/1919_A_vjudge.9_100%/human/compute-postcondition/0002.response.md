Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers using `map(int, input().split(' '))` and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0.
