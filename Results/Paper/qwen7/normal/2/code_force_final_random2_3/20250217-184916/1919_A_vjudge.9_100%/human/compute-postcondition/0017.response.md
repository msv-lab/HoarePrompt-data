Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, and the absolute difference between `a` and `b` remains either even or odd; `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

The code `a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The initial conditions about `t`, `i`, and the absolute difference between `a` and `b` being even or odd remain unchanged.
