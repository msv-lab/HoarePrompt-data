Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `t`.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `a` and `b` are integers from the input.
   - The absolute difference between `a` and `b` remains either even or odd.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `t` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
   - The values of `a` and `b` do not change within the loop, so they remain the same.
   - The condition that the absolute difference between `a` and `b` remains either even or odd does not change because it is a property of the initial input values and does not depend on the loop iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same.
   - The absolute difference between `a` and `b` remains either even or odd.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` and `b` are integers from the input, and the absolute difference between `a` and `b` remains either even or odd**.
