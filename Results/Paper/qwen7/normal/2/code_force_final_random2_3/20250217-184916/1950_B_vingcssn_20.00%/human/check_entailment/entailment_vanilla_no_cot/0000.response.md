Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a checkerboard pattern for any \( n > 4 \). The program includes hardcoded patterns for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \), but for \( n > 4 \), it prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "is not in the range" in Spanish), which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The program should generate the correct checkerboard pattern for any \( n \) within the specified range.
