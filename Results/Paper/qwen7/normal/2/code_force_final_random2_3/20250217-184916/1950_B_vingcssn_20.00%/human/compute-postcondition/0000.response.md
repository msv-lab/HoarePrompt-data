Output State: **`casos` is an input integer and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `casos`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on `t`. The value of `n` is not yet defined since the code snippet only reads `casos` and does not define or modify `n`. Therefore, the precondition that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20 remains valid but is not altered by the given code.
