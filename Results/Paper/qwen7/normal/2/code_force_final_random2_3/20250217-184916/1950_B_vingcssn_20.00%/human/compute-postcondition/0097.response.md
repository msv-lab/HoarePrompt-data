Functionality: **The function reads a number of test cases and for each case, it reads an integer \(n\) and prints a specific pattern based on the value of \(n\). If \(n\) is 1, it prints two lines of "##". If \(n\) is 2, it prints four lines with alternating patterns. If \(n\) is 3, it prints six lines with a more complex pattern. If \(n\) is 4, it prints eight lines with an even more complex pattern. If \(n\) is outside the range 1 to 4, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, the function outputs the final value of `c`, which is `casos - 1`.**
