Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not generate a 2n Ã— 2n checkerboard for arbitrary values of n within the specified range. It only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and outputs hardcoded patterns. For any other value of n, the program prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range"), which is incorrect according to the problem description. The program should generate a checkerboard pattern for any valid n, not just specific cases.
