Output State: **`casos` must be greater than 0; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 20; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variables `casos` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
