Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an input integer. 
  - If `n` equals 1, it remains 1.
  - If `n` equals 2, it remains 2.
  - If `n` equals 3, it becomes 3.
  - Otherwise, `n` remains different from 1, 2, and 4, and `c` is 0.

The print statement is simply `print('##..')`.

Since the print statement does not reference any variables that change based on the conditions provided, it will print the exact string `'##..'`.

Output: **##..**
