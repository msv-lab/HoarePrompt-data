Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an input integer. 
  - If `n` equals 1, it remains 1.
  - If `n` equals 2, it remains 2.
  - If `n` equals 3, it becomes 3.
  - Otherwise, `n` remains different from 1, 2, and 4, and `c` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('No esta en el rango')
```

This statement prints the string `'No esta en el rango'`, which translates to `'Not in range'` in English. Since the initial state does not specify any particular value for `n` other than the conditions mentioned, and since the print statement does not depend on the value of `n` or any other variable, the output will be the same regardless of the value of `n`.

Output: **'No esta en el rango'**
