The initial state provides information about the variables but does not give explicit values for them. However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables; it directly prints a hardcoded string.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('..##..##')
```

This statement will print the string `..##..##` regardless of the values of the other variables (`casos`, `t`, `n`, and `c`).

Output: **..##..##**
