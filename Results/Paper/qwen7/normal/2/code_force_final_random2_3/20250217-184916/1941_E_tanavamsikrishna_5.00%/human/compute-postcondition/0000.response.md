Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the integers inputted separated by spaces, and `rows` is still a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells.**

Explanation: The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. It does not modify the `rows` list, which remains unchanged from its initial state. The constraints on `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are preserved, and the structure of `rows` is maintained as a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` positive integers.
