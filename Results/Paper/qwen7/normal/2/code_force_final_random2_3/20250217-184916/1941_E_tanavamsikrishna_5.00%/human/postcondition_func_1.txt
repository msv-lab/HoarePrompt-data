The function accepts four integers \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \), along with a list of \( n \) lists named `rows`. Each inner list in `rows` contains \( m \) positive integers with the first and last elements being 0. The function calculates the sum of every \( k \) consecutive elements from a list derived from `rows` using `func_1`, then finds and prints the minimum value among these sums. The original `rows` list remains unchanged.
