Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is defined as `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total_costs` is a list containing one additional element which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]` starting from index 1 and going for `k` consecutive elements.
   - `rows` remains unchanged.
   - `costs` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be at least 1.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - We need to check if `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is still at least 1 after incrementing `i`.

Given that `i` is currently 2, after the next iteration, `i` will be 3. We need to ensure that `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is still at least 1.

Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, and it was valid at `i = 2`, it will still be valid at `i = 3` as long as `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`total_costs` is a list containing one additional element which is the sum of `costs[i:i + k]` starting from index 1 and going for `k` consecutive elements, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is 3, and `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be at least 2.**
