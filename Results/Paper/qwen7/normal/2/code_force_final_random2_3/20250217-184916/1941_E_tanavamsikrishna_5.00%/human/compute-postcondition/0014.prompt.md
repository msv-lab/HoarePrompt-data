You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m, k, d) are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells. The first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0. The sum of n⋅m for all sets of input data does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: Output State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from `costs`, `rows` remains unchanged, `costs` remains unchanged, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, and `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be equal to the length of `costs`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `total_costs` will contain the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the original `costs` list. The `rows` list and the `costs` list remain unchanged. The variable `i` will be equal to the last index where the sum could be calculated, which is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. This means that the loop has processed as many sums as possible based on the value of `k` and the length of the `costs` list.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: the minimum value among all the sums of k consecutive elements from the costs list
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d, which are integers with specific constraints. It also accepts a list named rows, which contains n lists. Each inner list has m positive integers, with the first and last elements being 0. The function returns a value based on the given parameters and the structure of the rows list.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
