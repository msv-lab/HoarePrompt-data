### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges over consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell \((i, j)\) is \(a_{i,j} + 1\).
   - The first and last columns have a depth of 0.
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes a single row and ensures that the cost of installing supports meets the distance constraint \(d\).
   - It increments the first \(d-1\) elements by 1.
   - For the remaining elements, it calculates the minimum cost considering the previous \(d\) elements and adds 1.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the entire grid and builds bridges on consecutive rows.
   - It reads the input values for \(n\), \(m\), \(k\), and \(d\).
   - It reads the grid into a list of rows.
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of supports for that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of \(k\) consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the constraints for installing supports.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes the grid and finds the minimum cost for building \(k\) bridges on consecutive rows.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the provided functions seem to correctly implement the solution.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
