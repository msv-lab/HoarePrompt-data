Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d, which are integers with specific constraints. It also accepts a list named rows, which contains n lists. Each inner list has m positive integers, with the first and last elements being 0. The function returns a value based on the given parameters and the structure of the rows list.**

This means the function `func_2` takes in four integer parameters and a list of lists. The parameters define the dimensions and conditions of the problem, and the list provides the depth values of river cells. The function then processes this information according to its logic and returns a specific value or result.
