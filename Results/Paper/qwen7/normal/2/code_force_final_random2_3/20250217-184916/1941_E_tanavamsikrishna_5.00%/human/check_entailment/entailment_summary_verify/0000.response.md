### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summaries step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(row: List[int], d: int):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
    return row[-1]
```

1. **First Loop**: This loop increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1. This ensures that the first support is always installed at the start of the row.
2. **Second Loop**: This loop starts from index `d-1` and iterates through the rest of the row. For each element, it calculates the cost as the minimum cost of the previous `d` elements plus 1 (for the current support) plus the current depth of the cell. This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

The function `func_1` correctly handles the distance constraint and calculates the minimum cost for a single row.

#### Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
    print(min(total_costs))
```

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the dimensions and the matrix of depths.
2. **Calculating Costs**: It calls `func_1` for each row to get the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.
3. **Summing Costs**: It then sums the costs of `k` consecutive rows and stores these sums in `total_costs`.
4. **Finding Minimum Total Cost**: Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.

The function `func_2` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the minimum cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows, ensuring that the distance constraint is respected.

#### Function Summary:
The provided function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_2`. It confirms that the function calculates the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from a list derived from `rows` using `func_1`, then finds and prints the minimum value among these sums.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The `func_1` function ensures that the distance constraint is respected, and `func_2` correctly calculates the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
