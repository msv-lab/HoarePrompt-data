Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The list `row` is a list of non-negative integers where each element from index 0 up to index `d-2` has been incremented by 1, `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports, and `i` is equal to `d-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, every element in the `row` list from the start up to the second last element will have been incremented by 1, depending on the value of `d`. The variable `d` remains unchanged, and `i` will be set to `d-1` after the last iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
    row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `d - 1`; `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports; `row[i]` is updated to the minimum value of `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]` plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `d`, `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports, `row[i]` is updated to `(min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `d + 1`, `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports, `row[i]` is updated to the minimum value of `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]` plus 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
