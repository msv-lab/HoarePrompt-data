Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i`, which is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop condition checks if `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`. This means that `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Initial Values of Other Variables**:
   - `total_costs` is an empty list.
   - `rows` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells.
   - `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is 0 and that the condition `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)` holds true for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- **Initial Value of `i`**: `i` is initialized to 0.
- **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. Since `i` starts at 0, this condition will hold true as long as `len(costs) - (k - 1)` is at least 1.

### Final State:
- `total_costs` is an empty list.
- `rows` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells.
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.
- `i` is 0.
- `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

### State:
**`total_costs` is an empty list, `rows` is a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`, `i` is 0, and `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be at least 1**.
