Output State: **`i` is 3, `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of costs from index 1 to 1 (i.e., costs[1:2])**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is 2, and the condition `len(costs) - (k - 1)` ensures that the slice `costs[i:i + k]` is valid.
- After incrementing `i` by 1, `i` becomes 3.
- The code appends the sum of the slice `costs[i:i + k]` to `total_costs`. With `i` now being 3, the slice is `costs[3:3 + k]`.
- Assuming `k` is at least 1, the slice `costs[3:3 + k]` simplifies to `costs[3:4]` when `k` is 1, which is just the element `costs[3]`.
- Therefore, `total_costs` now contains the sum of the first valid slice, which is `costs[1:2]` when `i` was 2, and now it will contain the sum of `costs[3:4]` when `i` is 3.
