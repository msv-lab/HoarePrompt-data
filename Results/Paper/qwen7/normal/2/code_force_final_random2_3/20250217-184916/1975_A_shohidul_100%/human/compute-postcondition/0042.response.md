Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `check_all_new` is a boolean value based on the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, `new_all` is a boolean value based on the condition `[(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]`, `i` is equal to `n`, `new` is a slice from index `n` to the end of `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
