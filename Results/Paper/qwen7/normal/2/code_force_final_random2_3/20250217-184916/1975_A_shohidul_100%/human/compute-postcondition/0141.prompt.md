You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
        
    #State: The loop has executed all iterations, and the final value of `t` is 0. `n` is the length of the list `a`, which may vary depending on the input. `check_all` remains unchanged from its last known state, and `i` is now equal to `n`. If the loop did not break early, `check_all` will be `True`, meaning all elements in `a` satisfy the condition `a[i-1] <= a[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `n`. If the loop breaks early, `check_all` will be `False`, indicating that there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in `a` that does not satisfy the condition.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
