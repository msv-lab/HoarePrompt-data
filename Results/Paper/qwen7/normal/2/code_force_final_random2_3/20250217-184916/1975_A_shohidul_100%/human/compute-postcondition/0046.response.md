Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. If `check_all` is True, then the function verifies whether each element in `a` is greater than or equal to the previous one starting from index 1. If `check_all` is True, the function continues to process as per the if part logic. If `check_all` is False, the function completes its iterations and the values of `t`, `n`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged from their last known state, with `i` now equal to `n`.
