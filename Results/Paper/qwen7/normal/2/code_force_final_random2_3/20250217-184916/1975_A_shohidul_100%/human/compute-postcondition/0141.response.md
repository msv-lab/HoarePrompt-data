Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next element). If the list is non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'. If not, it checks if the list can be split into two parts where the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing. If such a split exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
