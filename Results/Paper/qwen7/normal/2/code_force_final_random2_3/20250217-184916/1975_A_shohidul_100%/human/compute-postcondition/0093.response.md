Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `new` is an empty list, `check_all_new` is `True`, and `new_all` is `True`. If all elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 are less than or equal to the next element, `check_all` remains `True`. Otherwise, the loop will have executed all iterations and verified that no pair of consecutive elements in the remaining part of the list violates the condition `a[i-1] > a[i]`, ensuring `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both `True`.**
