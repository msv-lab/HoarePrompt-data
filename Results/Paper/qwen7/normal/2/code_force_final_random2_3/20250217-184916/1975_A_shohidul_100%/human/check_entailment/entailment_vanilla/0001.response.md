Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It then reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Sorted:**
   - The program uses `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position where the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is violated.
   - For each such position, it splits the array into two parts: `x = a[:i]` and `y = a[i:]`.
   - It then checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping these two parts.
     - `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` checks if the first element of the original array is greater than or equal to all elements in the second part.
     - `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])` checks if the second part is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such split satisfies the conditions, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - This part of the code correctly identifies if the array is already sorted, which is a valid scenario where no operation is needed.

2. **Handling Unsorted Arrays:**
   - The logic for splitting the array and checking the conditions is correct.
   - The program correctly identifies if a valid split exists that can make the array non-decreasing.
   - The program handles all edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts of the array.

**Correctness: True**
