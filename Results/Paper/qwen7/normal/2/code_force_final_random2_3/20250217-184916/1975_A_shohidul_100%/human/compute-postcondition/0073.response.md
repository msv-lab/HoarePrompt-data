Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `new` starts from `a[2]` to the end of the list `a`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
