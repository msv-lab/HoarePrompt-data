Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `new` starts from `a[3]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is True if all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the code, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the program would exit the current loop or conditional structure.
