Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because `range(1, n)` generates numbers starting from `1` up to but not including `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `check_all_new` remains unchanged.
   - `new_all` remains unchanged.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to `n-1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`, making `i` equal to `n`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `n`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `t`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `check_all_new` remains unchanged, `new_all` remains unchanged, and `i` is equal to `n`**.
