Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same regardless of the if condition.
