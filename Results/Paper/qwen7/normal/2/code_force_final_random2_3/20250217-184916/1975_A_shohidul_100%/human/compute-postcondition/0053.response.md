Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 (since the loop starts with `i = 1`).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 1, we need to ensure that `i` is 1.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 because if `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute.

5. **Consider the given state before the loop**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (this is not directly related to the loop, so no adjustment needed here).
   - `n` is an input integer (no change needed since it's already part of the loop head).
   - `a` is a list of integers (no change needed since it's not part of the loop head).
   - `check_all` is a boolean indicating a condition based on the list `a`, but this is not part of the loop head either.

Given the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
