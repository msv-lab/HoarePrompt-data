Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `new` starts from `a[3]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is True if all consecutive elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[2]`) is greater than `a[i]` (which is `a[3]`). If the condition is not met, the postcondition remains as initially stated.
