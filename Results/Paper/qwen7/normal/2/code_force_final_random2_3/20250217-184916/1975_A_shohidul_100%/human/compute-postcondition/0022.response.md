Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, and the condition `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating if the elements in `new` from index 0 to len(new)-1 are in non-decreasing order. Both `check_all_new` and `new_all` will be true if the corresponding conditions are met during the execution of the if or else part, and the loops or if statements will be broken out of in both cases.
