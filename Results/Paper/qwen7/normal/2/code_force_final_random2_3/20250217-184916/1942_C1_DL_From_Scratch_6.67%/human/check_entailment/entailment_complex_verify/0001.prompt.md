You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0. Additionally, the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    #State: All test cases have been processed, `T` is 0, `i` is `x - 1`, `count` is the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution for all test cases plus the number of test cases (`T`), `num` is `n - list0[-1]` for the last test case, and `list0` is sorted for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), followed by \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). It calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive integers in the list and adds the number of such gaps to the count of test cases minus one. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
2. **Constraints**:
   - \( n \): Number of sides of the polygon.
   - \( x \): Number of vertices already chosen by Bessie.
   - \( y \): Maximum number of additional vertices you can choose (in this version, \( y = 0 \)).
3. **Vertices**: Given as a list of \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \).
4. **Output**: Maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - `T`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read \( n \), \( x \), and the list of chosen vertices.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the list of chosen vertices to facilitate calculation.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - Iterate through the sorted list to count segments between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - If the segment length is 1, increment the count.
   - Handle the last segment separately.

4. **Output**:
   - Print the total count plus \( x - 2 \) (since the initial \( x \) vertices can form at most \( x - 2 \) triangles).

### Detailed Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting the list ensures that we correctly count the gaps between chosen vertices.

2. **Counting Segments**:
   - The logic for counting segments between consecutive chosen vertices is correct. However, the handling of the last segment needs careful consideration.

3. **Last Segment Handling**:
   - The last segment is handled by calculating `n - list0[-1]`, which is correct if the last vertex is not the last side of the polygon.
   - However, if the last vertex is the last side of the polygon, the segment length should be considered as \( n - list0[-1] \mod n \).

4. **Final Count Calculation**:
   - The final count should be adjusted to ensure it does not exceed the maximum possible triangles formed by the chosen vertices.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly counts the segments between chosen vertices.
- The handling of the last segment is almost correct but needs adjustment for edge cases.
- The final count formula \( count + x - 2 \) is generally correct but might need minor adjustments for edge cases.

### Edge Case Consideration:
- If the last vertex is the last side of the polygon, the segment length should be calculated modulo \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct but needs a minor adjustment for edge cases where the last vertex is the last side of the polygon.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
