`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is `x - 1`, `count` is the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution, `T` is `T - (x - 1)`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]` equals 1, and `list0` is sorted. After executing `count += 1`, the value of `count` is updated.

Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `count` is the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution plus 1, `T` is `T - (x - 1)`, `num` is `n - list0[-1]` equals 1, and `list0` is sorted.**
