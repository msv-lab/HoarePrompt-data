Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, and is the number of test cases. Each test case will contain three integers n, x, and y, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0. Additionally, the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The first line of each test case contains these three integers n, x, and y. The second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

In this output state, the variable `T` is updated to the integer value obtained from `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases. The conditions and constraints for `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the structure of the input for each test case is also preserved.
