Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and splits them into variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The values of `cn2`, `j`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
