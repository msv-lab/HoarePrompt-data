Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered for each iteration, `b` is the second integer entered for each iteration, `f` is the third integer entered for each iteration, `j` is the last value it took during the loop execution, which is `m-1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `sum_f` will hold the total sum of all `f` values entered for each iteration from `j` ranging between `0` to `m-1`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and the final value of `j` (which is `m-1`) will remain as described.
