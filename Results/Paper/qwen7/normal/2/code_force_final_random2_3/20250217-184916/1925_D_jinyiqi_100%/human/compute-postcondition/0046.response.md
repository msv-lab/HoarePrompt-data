Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `sum_f` is 0, `a`, `b`, `f`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `i`, and `t` are not yet defined.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sum_f` to 0. No other variables are affected. The values of `cn2`, `j`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `p`, `q`, `gcd`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
