Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head specifies `j` in the range `range(m)`. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `j`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `m - 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since `j` starts at `m - 1` and needs to be decremented by 1 for each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `m - 2`.

5. **Verify other states**: The other states (`cn2`, `sum_f`, `a`, `b`, and `f`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f`, `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split**.
