Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 2`, `sum_f` is the sum of all input values of `f` plus the latest input value of `f`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `sum_f += f` adds the latest input value of `f` to the current value of `sum_f`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `sum_f` now includes the sum of all previous input values of `f` plus the latest one.
