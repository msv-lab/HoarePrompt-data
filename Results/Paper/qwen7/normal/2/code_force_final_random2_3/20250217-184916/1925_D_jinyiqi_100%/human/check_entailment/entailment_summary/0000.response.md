Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The program correctly calculates the sum of all friendship values (`sum_f`) for each test case.
3. **Combinations Calculation**: The calculation of combinations `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2` is correct, representing the total number of unique pairs from `n` children.
4. **Expression Calculation**: The expression `p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` and `q = 2 * cn2 ** 2` are derived from the problem statement and are correct.
5. **GCD Simplification**: The greatest common divisor (gcd) is calculated correctly and used to simplify the fraction.
6. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse**: The program computes the modular multiplicative inverse of the simplified fraction correctly using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
7. **Output**: The output format matches the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the logic and calculations as described in the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
