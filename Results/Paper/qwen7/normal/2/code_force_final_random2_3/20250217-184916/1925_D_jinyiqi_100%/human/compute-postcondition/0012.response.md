Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers entered by the user, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `f` is the third integer entered, `j` is 2, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `f` is the third integer entered.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `j`) remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are now specific integers entered by the user.
