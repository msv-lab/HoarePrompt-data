Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `m-1`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` will be the first integer entered for each iteration, `b` will be the second integer entered for each iteration, `sum_f` will be the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`, and `f` will be the third integer entered for each iteration.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `j` will hold the value `m-1`, indicating the last index processed. The variable `m` must still be at least 1. For each iteration of the loop, the values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are read from input, and `sum_f` accumulates the sum of all these `f` values.
