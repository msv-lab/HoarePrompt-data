Output State: **`cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is `m - 1`, `m` must be at least 1, `a` is the first integer entered for each iteration, `b` is the second integer entered for each iteration, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the range of `m`, `f` is the third integer entered for each iteration, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)` divided by `gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2 // gcd`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.**

Explanation: The line `q = q // gcd` divides `q` by `gcd` and updates the value of `q`. Since `q` was initially `2 * cn2`, after this operation, `q` becomes `2 * cn2 // gcd`. The values of `cn2`, `j`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `sum_f`, `f`, `p`, and `gcd` remain unchanged from their initial states.
