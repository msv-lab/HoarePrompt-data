Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine which letter (A or B) appears most frequently in each test case string. The program iterates through each character of the string, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', and then prints the more frequent letter. Given the constraints and the example provided, the program works as expected.
