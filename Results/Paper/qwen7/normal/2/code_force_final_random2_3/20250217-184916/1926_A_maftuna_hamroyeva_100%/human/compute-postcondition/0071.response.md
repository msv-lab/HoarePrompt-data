Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `a`.

2. **Understand the postcondition from the previous iteration**: The postcondition states that `j` is a string and either:
   - `j` is equal to 'A' and `l` is increased by 1, or
   - `j` is not equal to 'A' and `h` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is a string, it remains a string in the next iteration.
   - The value of `j` could be either 'A' or not 'A'.
   - If `j` was 'A' in the previous iteration, then `l` was increased by 1, so `l` is now `l + 1`.
   - If `j` was not 'A' in the previous iteration, then `h` was increased by 1, so `h` is now `h + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `j` remains a string but its specific value is not known yet (it could be 'A' or not 'A').
   - The variable `a` remains unchanged as it is the iterable and not modified within the loop.
   - The variables `l` and `h` are adjusted based on the condition met in the previous iteration.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of `l` and `h` based on the previous iteration's condition.

**State: **`j` is a string, `l` is increased by 1 if `j` was 'A', or `h` is increased by 1 if `j` was not 'A'**. 

To provide a concrete example, let's assume `j` was 'A' in the previous iteration:
- `l` is now `l + 1`.
- `h` remains the same.

If `j` was not 'A' in the previous iteration:
- `h` is now `h + 1`.
- `l` remains the same.

Since the exact values of `l` and `h` depend on the previous iteration, we can represent the state as follows:

**State: **`j` is a string, `l` is `l + 1` if `j` was 'A' in the previous iteration, or `h` is `h + 1` if `j` was not 'A' in the previous iteration**.
