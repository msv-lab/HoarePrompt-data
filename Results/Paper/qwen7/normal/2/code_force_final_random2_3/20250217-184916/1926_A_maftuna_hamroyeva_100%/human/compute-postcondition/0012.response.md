Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in a:`. This means the loop iterates over each character in the string `a`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 32.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is a non-empty input string.
   - `l` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the first character of `a` is 'A'.
   - `h` is 0 if the first character of `a` is 'A' and 1 otherwise.
   - `j` is the first character of `a`.

3. **Understand what happens in the loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `a`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the first character of `a`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the second character of `a`.
   - `l` and `h` remain the same as they depend on the first character of `a`, which hasn't changed yet.
   - `t`, `i`, and `a` remain unchanged because they are not directly modified within the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` remains an integer between 1 and 32.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `a` remains a non-empty input string.
   - `l` remains either 1 or 0 depending on whether the first character of `a` is 'A'.
   - `h` remains 0 if the first character of `a` is 'A' and 1 otherwise.
   - `j` becomes the second character of `a`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty input string, `l` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether the first character of `a` is 'A', `h` is 0 if the first character of `a` is 'A' and 1 otherwise, `j` is the second character of `a`**.
