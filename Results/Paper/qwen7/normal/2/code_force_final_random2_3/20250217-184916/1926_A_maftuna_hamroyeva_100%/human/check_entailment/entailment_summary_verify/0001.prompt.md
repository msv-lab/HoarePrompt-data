You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, an input string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. It counts the number of 'A' characters in each string and compares this count to the number of non-'A' characters. Based on this comparison, it prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function returns nothing but outputs a sequence of 'A' or 'B' characters, one for each input string processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Character Counting**: For each string `a`, the program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using two counters `l` and `h`.
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, it compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If 'A' is more frequent, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all test cases where the strings are of length 5 and consist only of 'A' and 'B'.
   - It correctly handles ties by always printing the character that appears more frequently. If both 'A' and 'B' appear equally, the program will print 'A' because `l` is incremented before `h` in the loop.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided example.
