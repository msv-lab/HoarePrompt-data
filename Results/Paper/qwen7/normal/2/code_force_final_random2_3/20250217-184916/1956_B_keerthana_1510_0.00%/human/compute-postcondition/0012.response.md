Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and a list `a` containing `n` integers (each in the range 1 to n, inclusive, and appearing at most twice). It then prints the sum of counts of each unique item in every valid line (starting from the third line and taking every second line) divided by 3 for each test case. The function does not return any value but produces output based on the input provided.**
