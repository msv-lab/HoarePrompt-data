Output State: The loop will terminate when `low` exceeds `high`. At this point, `max_profit` will hold the maximum profit found during the iterations, `low` will be the smallest midpoint where no further increase in profit is found compared to its neighbors, and `high` will be the largest midpoint checked before `low` surpassed it. The values of `mid`, `profit_mid`, and `profit_next` will be irrelevant once the loop exits, as they are recalculated in each iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `max_profit` will contain the highest profit found, `low` will point to the best midpoint where the profit stops increasing, and `high` will be the last midpoint checked before `low` moved past it, indicating the end of the search range.
