### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \) such that the first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - The modified price for the \( i \)-th bun (where \( 1 \le i \le k \)) is \( b - i + 1 \).

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified prices is calculated by summing up the modified prices from \( b \) down to \( b - k + 1 \).
   - This can be expressed as \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \) (sum of the first \( k \) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \)).
   - The profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \) is \( (n - k) \cdot a \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the profit for a given \( k \), \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

4. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes the search range from \( 0 \) to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit for \( k = mid \) and \( k = mid + 1 \).
   - It updates the search range based on which profit is higher.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \) correctly by considering the usual price \( a \).

### Analysis of the Given Code:

- The `func_1` function correctly implements the profit calculation formula.
- The `func_2` function uses binary search to efficiently find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
- The logic inside the binary search loop is correct and ensures that the maximum profit is found.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State:**
  - \( n \) is the number of buns.
  - \( a \) is the usual price of a bun.
  - \( b \) is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
  - \( low \) and \( high \) are initialized to \( 0 \) and \( \min(n, b) \) respectively.
  - `max_profit` is initialized to \( 0 \).

- **Loop Invariants:**
  - The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.
  - During each iteration, `mid` is calculated as the midpoint of the current range.
  - `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are calculated using `func_1` for \( k = mid \) and \( k = mid + 1 \) respectively.
  - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1` to search in the upper half; otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` to search in the lower half.
  - The maximum profit is updated with the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.

- **Final State:**
  - After the loop, `low` will be greater than `high`.
  - `max_profit` will hold the maximum profit found during the iterations.
  - The function returns `max_profit`.

### Conclusion:

- The `func_1` function correctly calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
- The `func_2` function correctly uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
- The edge case where \( k = 0 \) is handled correctly.

Given the correct implementation of both functions and the proper use of binary search to find the optimal \( k \), the provided program is correct.
