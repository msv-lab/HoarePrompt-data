### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \) such that the first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - The modified price for the \( i \)-th bun (where \( 1 \le i \le k \)) is \( b - i + 1 \).

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified prices is calculated by summing up the modified prices from \( b \) down to \( b - k + 1 \).
   - This can be expressed as \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \) (sum of the first \( k \) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \)).
   - The profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \) is \( (n - k) \cdot a \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the profit for a given \( k \), \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

4. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes the search range from \( 0 \) to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit for \( k = mid \) and \( k = mid + 1 \).
   - It updates the search range based on which profit is higher.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \) correctly by considering the usual price \( a \).

### Analysis of the Given Code:

- The `func_1` function correctly implements the profit calculation formula.
- The `func_2` function uses binary search to efficiently find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
- The logic inside the binary search loop is correct and ensures that the maximum profit is found.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is read from input, indicating the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read from input.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function calculates the profit for a given \( k \), \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
  - The formula \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \) is correctly implemented.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The function performs a binary search to find the optimal \( k \).
  - The initial search range is set from \( 0 \) to \( \min(n, b) \).
  - For each midpoint \( mid \), the profit for \( k = mid \) and \( k = mid + 1 \) is calculated using `func_1`.
  - The search range is updated based on the comparison of these profits.
  - The loop continues until the search range is exhausted, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.

### Validation of the Original Assessment:

- The original assessment correctly identifies the correct implementation of both functions and the proper use of binary search.
- The edge cases are handled appropriately, including the case where \( k = 0 \).
