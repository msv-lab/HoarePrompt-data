Output State: **`low` is `mid` + 1, `high` is greater than or equal to `mid`, `mid` is updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `profit_mid` is the value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the value of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`**.

Explanation: The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The other variables (`high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition that `low` is less than or equal to `high` still holds true, and `mid` is still updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2.
