Postcondition: `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2; `profit_mid` is the value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the value of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, `low` is updated to `mid` + 1 and `high` remains greater than or equal to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is updated to be less than or equal to `high` - 1 and `mid` is updated accordingly.
