To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

The loop condition is `low <= high`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `low <= high` must be true.

Let's break down the possible scenarios based on the postconditions given:

1. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`:
   - `low` is updated to `mid + 1`
   - `high` is updated to the minimum of `n` and `b`
   - `mid` is recalculated as `(0 + high) // 2`
   - `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are updated accordingly
   - `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`

2. Otherwise (if `profit_next` is not greater than `profit_mid`):
   - `low` remains 0
   - `high` is updated to `mid - 1`
   - `mid` is recalculated as `(0 + high) // 2`
   - `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are updated accordingly
   - `max_profit` is still the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`

In both cases, the loop continues as long as `low <= high`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to continue executing is `high`.

If `high` is updated to `mid - 1` in the second scenario, the new value of `high` must still satisfy the condition `low <= high`. Since `low` is either 0 or `mid + 1` (from the first scenario), `high` must be at least `mid + 1` to ensure the condition holds.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is `high` such that `low <= high` remains true.

State: **`low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` are as follows: `high` must be at least `mid + 1` to ensure `low <= high`**
