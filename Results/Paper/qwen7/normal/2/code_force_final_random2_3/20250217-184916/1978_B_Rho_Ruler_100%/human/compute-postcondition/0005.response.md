Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is (0 + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `profit_next` by calling the function `func_1` with `mid + 1` as the first argument instead of `mid`. All other variables retain their previous values.
