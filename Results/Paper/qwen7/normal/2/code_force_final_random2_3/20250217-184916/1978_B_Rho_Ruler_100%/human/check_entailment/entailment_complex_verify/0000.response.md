### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function calculates the profit for a given `k` value:
\[ \text{Profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

- The term \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \) represents the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price.
- The term \( (n - k) \times a \) represents the profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price.

The function correctly implements the formula provided in the problem description.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` value that maximizes the profit:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `low` is set to 0.
   - `high` is set to the minimum of `n` and `b`.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`.
   - For each iteration, `mid` is calculated as the midpoint of the current range.
   - `profit_mid` is computed using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.
   - `profit_next` is computed using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
   - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` by 1 would increase the profit, so we move the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, we move the `high` pointer to `mid - 1`.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns the maximum profit found during the iterations, which is stored in `max_profit`.

The binary search approach ensures that the optimal `k` value is found efficiently. The loop will terminate when `low` exceeds `high`, and `max_profit` will contain the highest profit found.

#### Overall Program:
- The main part of the program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_2(n, a, b)` and printing the result.

### Validation with Annotations:
The annotations provided align well with the program's behavior:
- The `func_1` function correctly computes the profit for a given `k`.
- The `func_2` function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` and returns the maximum profit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given promotion rules. The binary search approach ensures that the optimal `k` value is found efficiently, and the profit calculation is accurate for any valid input within the specified ranges.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
