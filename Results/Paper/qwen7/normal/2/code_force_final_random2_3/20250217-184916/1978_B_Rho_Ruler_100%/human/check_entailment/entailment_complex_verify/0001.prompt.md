You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(func_2(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b), n is an integer representing the number of buns, a is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and b is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
    #The program returns the expression k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a, where k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b), n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total cost of selling buns. It considers the first k buns to be sold at a modified price b, and the remaining (n - k) buns to be sold at the usual price a. The function also accounts for the discount applied to the first k buns using the formula k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of buns, a is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and b is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. Additionally, 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, and 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b), where k is an integer chosen by Bob to maximize his profit.
def func_2(n, a, b):
    low, high = 0, min(n, b)
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `low` is greater than `high`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit found during the iterations, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the profits at `mid` and `mid + 1` respectively, and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the condition `low <= high` will no longer be satisfied, meaning `low` will be greater than `high`. The variable `max_profit` will hold the highest profit found during the entire process of narrowing down the range. `mid` will be the last midpoint calculated, and `profit_mid` and `profit_next` will be the profits corresponding to `mid` and `mid + 1` in the final iteration. The value of `high` will be the minimum of `n` and `b`, as it is not changed once the loop terminates.
    return max_profit
    #The program returns the maximum profit found during the iterations, which is stored in the variable `max_profit`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of buns), `a` (the usual price of a bun), and `b` (the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). It calculates and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling some of the buns at the modified price (`b`). The function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price, ensuring the maximum profit is determined.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \) such that the first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - The modified price for the \( i \)-th bun (where \( 1 \le i \le k \)) is \( b - i + 1 \).

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified prices is calculated by summing up the modified prices from \( b \) down to \( b - k + 1 \).
   - This can be expressed as \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \) (sum of the first \( k \) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \)).
   - The profit from selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \) is \( (n - k) \cdot a \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the profit for a given \( k \), \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).

4. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes the search range from \( 0 \) to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit for \( k = mid \) and \( k = mid + 1 \).
   - It updates the search range based on which profit is higher.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \) correctly by considering the usual price \( a \).

### Analysis of the Given Code:

- The `func_1` function correctly implements the profit calculation formula.
- The `func_2` function uses binary search to efficiently find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
- The logic inside the binary search loop is correct and ensures that the maximum profit is found.

### Conclusion:

Given the correct implementation of both functions and the proper use of binary search to find the optimal \( k \), the provided program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
