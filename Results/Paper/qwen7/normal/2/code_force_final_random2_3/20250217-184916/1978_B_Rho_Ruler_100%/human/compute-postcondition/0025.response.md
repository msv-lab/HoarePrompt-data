Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2; `profit_mid` is now the value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is not updated; `profit_next` is not updated.**

This means that the value of `profit_mid` has been updated to the result of calling the function `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
