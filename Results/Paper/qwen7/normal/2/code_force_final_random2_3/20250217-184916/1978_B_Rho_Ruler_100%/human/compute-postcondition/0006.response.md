Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is (0 + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`**.

Explanation: The line `max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)` updates the value of `max_profit` to be the maximum between its current value and `profit_mid`. All other variables (`low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, and `profit_next`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
