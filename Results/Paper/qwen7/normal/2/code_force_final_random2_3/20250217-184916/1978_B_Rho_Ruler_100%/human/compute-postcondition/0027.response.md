Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is updated to (`low` + `high`) // 2; `profit_mid` is the value of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` is the value of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b); `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)` updates the value of `max_profit` to be the maximum of its current value and `profit_mid`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
