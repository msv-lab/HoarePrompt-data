### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling buns under a specific promotional pricing scheme. The key points are:
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \leq k \leq \min(n, b) \)).
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price \( b - i + 1 \) for the \( i \)-th bun.
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total cost of selling buns when \( k \) buns are sold at the modified price.
   - The formula used is \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \).
     - \( k \cdot b \): Total revenue from the first \( k \) buns.
     - \( -\frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} \): Discount applied to the first \( k \) buns.
     - \( (n - k) \cdot a \): Revenue from the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It iteratively narrows down the range of \( k \) using binary search.
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit using `func_1(mid)` and `func_1(mid + 1)`.
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is higher, it updates the lower bound; otherwise, it updates the upper bound.
   - The loop continues until the lower bound exceeds the upper bound.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum profit found.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for any given \( k \).
   - The binary search in `func_2` correctly identifies the optimal \( k \) by comparing the profits for \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \).
   - The constraints and conditions are handled appropriately within the functions.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
