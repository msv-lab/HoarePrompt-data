Output State: **`low` is set, `high` is mid - 1, `mid` is set to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `profit_next` is not updated**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `mid` is still (`low` + `high`) // 2, and `profit_mid` remains the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. Since no new calculation for `profit_next` is performed, its value remains unchanged.
