Output State: **`low` is mid + 1, `high` is set, `mid` is set to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. The values of `high`, `mid`, `profit_mid`, `max_profit`, and `profit_next` remain unchanged from their previous states.
