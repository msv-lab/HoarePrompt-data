You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of buns, a is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and b is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. Additionally, 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, and 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b), where k is an integer chosen by Bob to maximize his profit.
def func_2(n, a, b):
    low, high = 0, min(n, b)
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `low` is greater than `high`, `max_profit` is the maximum profit found during the iterations, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `profit_mid` and `profit_next` are the profits at `mid` and `mid + 1` respectively, and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the condition `low <= high` will no longer be satisfied, meaning `low` will be greater than `high`. The variable `max_profit` will hold the highest profit found during the entire process of narrowing down the range. `mid` will be the last midpoint calculated, and `profit_mid` and `profit_next` will be the profits corresponding to `mid` and `mid + 1` in the final iteration. The value of `high` will be the minimum of `n` and `b`, as it is not changed once the loop terminates.
    return max_profit
    #The program returns the maximum profit found during the iterations, which is stored in the variable `max_profit`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of buns), `a` (an integer representing the usual price of a bun), and `b` (an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price). It returns the maximum profit found during the iterations.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum profit found during the iterations, which is stored in the variable `max_profit`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
