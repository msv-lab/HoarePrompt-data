The only variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `low <= high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0, and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `low <= high` must be true. Since `low` is already 0, `high` must be greater than or equal to 0. Given that `high` is defined as the minimum of `n` and `b`, both `n` and `b` must be considered.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted such that `high` is greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b` and `high` must be greater than or equal to 0**
