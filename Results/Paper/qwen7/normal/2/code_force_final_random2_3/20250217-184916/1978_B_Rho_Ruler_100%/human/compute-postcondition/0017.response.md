Output State: **`low` is set, `high` is set, `mid` is set to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `profit_mid` is the result of `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`, `profit_next` remains unchanged, and `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `profit_mid` by calling the function `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. The values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit` remain unchanged from their initial state.
