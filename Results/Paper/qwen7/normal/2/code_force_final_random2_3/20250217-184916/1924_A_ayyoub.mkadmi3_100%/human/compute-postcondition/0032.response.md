Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `s` (a string), `k` (a positive integer), and `n` (a positive integer). It returns a boolean indicating whether the length of a substring of `s` starting from index `r * k` to the end is greater than or equal to `n * k`, along with the last character of `s` if it was in `alphabet` and `len(alphabet) == 1` during any iteration.**
