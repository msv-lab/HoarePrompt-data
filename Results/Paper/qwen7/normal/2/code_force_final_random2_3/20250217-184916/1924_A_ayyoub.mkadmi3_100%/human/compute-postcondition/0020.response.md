Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `m-1` starting with the second character of the original `s`, `i` is the third character of the original `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1' with `i` removed if `len(alphabet) != 1`. If `i` is in `alphabet`, `s` is concatenated with `i`; otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.
