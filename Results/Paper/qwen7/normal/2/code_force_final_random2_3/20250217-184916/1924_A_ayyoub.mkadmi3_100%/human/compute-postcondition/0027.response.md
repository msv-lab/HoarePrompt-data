The code `s1 += i` appends the character `i` to the string `s1`. Given the initial state:

- `s` is a string of length `m-2` starting with the third character of the original `s`.
- `i` is the fourth character of the original `s`.
- `alphabet` is a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1' with `i` removed if `len(alphabet) != 1`.

Since `s1` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty string before the operation. After executing `s1 += i`, `s1` will contain the character `i`.

The conditions related to `alphabet` and `i` remain unchanged because the code does not affect these variables.

Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`s1` is the character `i`, `s` is a string of length `m-2` starting with the third character of the original `s`, `i` is the fourth character of the original `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1' with `i` removed if `len(alphabet) != 1`.**
