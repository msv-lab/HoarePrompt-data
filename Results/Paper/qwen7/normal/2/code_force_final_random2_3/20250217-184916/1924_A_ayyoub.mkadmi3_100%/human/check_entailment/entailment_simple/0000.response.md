### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` processes the string `s` and checks if all characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appear in `s`.
   - It maintains three variables:
     - `s1`: A string that accumulates characters from `s` that are in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
     - `s2`: A string that accumulates the last character of `s` if it was the only character left in `alphabet` at any point.
     - `alphabet`: A set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - After processing `s`, `s1` contains all characters from `s` that were in `alphabet`, and `s2` contains the last character of `s` if it was in `alphabet` and `len(alphabet) == 1` during any iteration.
   - The function returns a tuple:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

2. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and checks the result.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
     - It prints "NO" and constructs a string `be9i` of length `n - len(s2)` using the first character of `alphabet` that is not in `s1`.
     - It appends `s2 + be9i` to `OUT`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES".

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness:**
   - The logic correctly identifies when a string `s` does not contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
   - The construction of the string `be9i` ensures that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s` if `s` is missing some necessary characters.
   - The main program correctly handles both cases and outputs the required results.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`. It also correctly constructs and outputs a string that is not a subsequence if needed.

**Correctness: True**
