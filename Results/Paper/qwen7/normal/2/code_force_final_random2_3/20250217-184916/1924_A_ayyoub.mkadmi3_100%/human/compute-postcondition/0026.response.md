Postcondition: **`s` is a string of length `m-2` starting with the third character of the original `s`, `i` is the fourth character of the original `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing characters from 'a' to 'a+k-1' with `i` removed if `len(alphabet) != 1`. If `len(alphabet) != 1`, then `i` is not the only element in `alphabet`. Otherwise, `s2` is a string containing the character `i`, and `s` remains unchanged.**
