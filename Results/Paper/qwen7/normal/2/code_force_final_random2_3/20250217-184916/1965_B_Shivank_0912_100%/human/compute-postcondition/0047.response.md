Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j`.

2. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that `j` is an integer, and if `j` is not equal to `i`, then `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << j`. If `j` equals `i`, then `ans` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is an integer.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - The variable `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `j`.

Given that `j` starts from 0 (as per the range `range(20)`), and assuming `j` was not equal to `i` in the previous iteration, the next value of `j` will be 1. Therefore, `ans` will be updated to include the value `1 << 1` (which is 2).

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `j` will be 1.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `ans` will be a list containing the value `1 << 1`, which is `[2]`.

State: **`j` is 1, `i` is an integer, and `ans` is a list containing the value `2`**.
