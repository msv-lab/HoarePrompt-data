Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `1 << (i + 1) <= k`.
2. **Current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Loop head variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the loop condition with the current value of `i`:

- When `i = 1`, the condition becomes `1 << (1 + 1) <= k`, which simplifies to `1 << 2 <= k` or `4 <= k`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `1 << (i + 1) <= k` must be true. Given that `i` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `1 << (1 + 1) <= k` is true.

Since `i` is fixed at 1, the only thing that can change to satisfy the condition is `k`. Therefore, `k` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute one more time.

So, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 1 and `k` must be greater than or equal to 4**
