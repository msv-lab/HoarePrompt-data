Based on the initial state provided:

- The list `ans` contains all integers from 1048576 to 1048575 * 2^19.
- The variable `j` is set to 20.

The `print(*ans)` statement will unpack the list `ans` and print its elements separated by spaces.

To determine the range of numbers in `ans`:
- The starting number is 1048576.
- The ending number is 1048575 * 2^19.

Let's calculate the ending number:
\[ 1048575 \times 2^{19} = 1048575 \times 524288 = 549755813888 \]

So, `ans` is a list containing all integers from 1048576 to 549755813888.

When `print(*ans)` is executed, it will print all these integers separated by spaces.

Output: **1048576 1048577 1048578 ... 549755813887 549755813888**
