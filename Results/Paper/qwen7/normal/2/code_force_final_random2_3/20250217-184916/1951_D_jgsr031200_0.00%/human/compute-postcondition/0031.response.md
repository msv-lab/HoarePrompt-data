Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `costs` is a list containing the element 1.
   - `h` is the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs` until `n` becomes less than `i`.
   - `n` is reduced to 0.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*costs)
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The `*costs` syntax in the `print` function unpacks the list `costs` and prints its elements separated by spaces.
   - Since `costs` is explicitly stated to contain only the element 1, the list `costs` is `[1]`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - When the `print(*costs)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the list `costs` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1**
