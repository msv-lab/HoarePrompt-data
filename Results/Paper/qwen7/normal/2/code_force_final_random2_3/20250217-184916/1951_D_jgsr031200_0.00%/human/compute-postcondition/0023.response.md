Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the element 1, `h` is increased by `curr`, `n` is updated by decreasing it by `curr` and then by `(n - k + 1) * curr`, `curr` is updated to `n // i`, `h` is now `h + curr`, `n` is decreased by `i * curr`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` decreases the value of `n` by `i * curr`. The other variables (`costs`, `h`, `n`, `curr`) are not directly affected by this line of code, but their previous values are used in the operation. Therefore, the updated value of `n` is its previous value minus `i * curr`.
