Postcondition: **`costs` is a list containing the element 1, `h` is the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs` until `n` becomes less than `i`, `n` is reduced to 0, and if `h` is less than `k`, the function does not perform any additional operation; if `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, the function ensures that `h` remains greater than or equal to `k` after the operations.**
