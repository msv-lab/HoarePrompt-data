### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Case 1: \( n = k \)**:
   - If `n` equals `k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin. This is correct because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels if the price is 1 coin, and she has exactly `k` coins.

3. **Case 2: \( n < k \)**:
   - If `n` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than required.

4. **Case 3: \( n \geq k \)**:
   - If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program attempts to find a way to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - It calculates the cost array `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, decrementing `n` and accumulating the number of stalls needed.
   - Finally, it checks if the total number of stalls (`h`) is at least `k`. If `h` is less than `k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls along with the corresponding prices.

However, there are some issues with the logic and implementation:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Stalls**: The calculation of the number of stalls and their prices might not always ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Specifically, the logic for setting up the stalls and calculating the number of stalls is flawed.
- **Output Format**: The output format should strictly follow the problem statement. For example, if the answer is "YES", the number of stalls and the prices should be printed as specified.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

**False**
