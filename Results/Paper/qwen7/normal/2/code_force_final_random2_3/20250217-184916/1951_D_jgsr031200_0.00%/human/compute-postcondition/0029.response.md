Based on the initial state provided:

- `costs` is a list containing the element 1.
- `h` is the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs` until `n` becomes less than `i`.
- `n` is reduced to 0.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. `costs` is a list with one element, which is 1.
2. `h` is calculated by iterating over each element `i` in `costs` and adding `n // i` to `h` until `n` is less than `i`. Since `n` starts at 0 and is reduced to 0, the loop does not execute because the condition `n >= i` is never true (since `n` is 0 and `i` is 1). Therefore, `h` remains 0.
3. The condition `h >= k` is checked, but since `h` is 0, this condition does not affect the value of `h`.

Given the above, the print statement `print(2)` will simply print the number 2.

Output: **2**
