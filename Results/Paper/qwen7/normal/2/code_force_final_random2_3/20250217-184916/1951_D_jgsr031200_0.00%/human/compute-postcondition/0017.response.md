Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is increased by `n`, `n` is decreased by `curr`, `curr` is `n // i`**

Explanation: The code `curr = n // i` updates the value of `curr` to be the integer division of `n` by `i`. The other variables (`costs`, `h`, and `n`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
