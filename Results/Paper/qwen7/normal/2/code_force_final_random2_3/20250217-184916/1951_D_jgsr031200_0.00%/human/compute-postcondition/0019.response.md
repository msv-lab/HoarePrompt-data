Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is increased by `n // curr`, `n` is decreased by `curr`, `n` is further decreased by `i * curr`.**

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` decreases the value of `n` by `i * curr`. The other variables (`costs`, `h`, and `n` being decreased by `curr`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `costs` remains a list containing `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is increased by `n // curr`, `n` is decreased by `curr`, and now it is further decreased by `i * curr`.
