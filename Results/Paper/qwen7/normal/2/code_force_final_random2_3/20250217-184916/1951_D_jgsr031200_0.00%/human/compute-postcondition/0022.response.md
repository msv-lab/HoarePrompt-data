Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the element 1, `h` is increased by `curr`, `n` is updated by decreasing it by `curr` and then by `(n - k + 1) * curr`, `curr` is updated to `n // i`, `h` is now `h + curr`**.

Explanation: The code `h += curr` increments the value of `h` by the current value of `curr`. All other variables (`costs`, `n`, and `curr`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
