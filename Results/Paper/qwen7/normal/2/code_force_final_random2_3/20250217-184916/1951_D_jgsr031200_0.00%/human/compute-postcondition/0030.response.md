Based on the initial state provided:

- `costs` is a list containing the element 1.
- `h` is the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs` until `n` becomes less than `i`.
- `n` is reduced to 0.
- `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the steps:

1. `costs` is a list with one element, which is 1.
2. `h` is calculated by summing up `n // i` for each `i` in `costs` until `n` becomes less than `i`. Since `n` is eventually reduced to 0, the loop will only run once (for `i = 1`), and `n // 1` will be `n` itself.
3. Since `n` is reduced to 0, the value of `h` will be `n` (which is 0) plus any previous value of `h` (which starts at 0). Therefore, `h` remains 0.
4. It is stated that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`. This means `k` must be less than or equal to 0.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Output: **YES**
