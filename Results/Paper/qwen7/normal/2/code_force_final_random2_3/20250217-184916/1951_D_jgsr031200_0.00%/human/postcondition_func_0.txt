The function accepts two parameters, n and k, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. If n equals k, the function prints 'YES' followed by 1 twice and returns k. If n is less than k, the function prints 'NO' and returns None. If n is greater than or equal to k, the function calculates the sum of n divided by each element in a list containing n - k + 1 and 1, and checks if this sum is at least k. If the sum is less than k, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', 2, and the list [1].
