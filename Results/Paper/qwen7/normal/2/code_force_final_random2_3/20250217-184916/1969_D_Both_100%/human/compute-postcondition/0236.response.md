Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it calculates the maximum possible profit by combining Alice's prices (represented as negative values) and Bob's bonuses. It uses a min-heap to keep track of the smallest combined values and iteratively adjusts the profit based on these values. The function ultimately prints the highest profit achieved across all test cases.**
