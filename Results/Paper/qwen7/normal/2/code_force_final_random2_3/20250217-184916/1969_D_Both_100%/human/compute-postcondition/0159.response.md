Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `max_profit` remains the highest `current_profit` value encountered during the loop's execution, `current_profit` reflects the net profit calculated based on the operations performed within the loop, `combined` is an empty list, `removed_item` will be True for each iteration where the operation `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` was executed, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, making it `test_cases - 1` if it was initially greater than 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list; `prices` is updated to a list of negative values of the original `prices`, `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `neg_prices` which contains the negative values of the elements in the original `prices` list. The original values of `heap`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `combined`, `removed_item`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
