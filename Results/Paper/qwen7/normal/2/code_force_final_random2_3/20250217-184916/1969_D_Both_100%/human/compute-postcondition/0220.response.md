Output State: **`heap` now contains all items except the one that was replaced by `item`, `removed_item` is the item that was heappushed and heappopped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting the first element of `removed_item`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, `combined` is `True`, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`.**

This means that the `current_profit` has been updated by subtracting the second element (index 1) of the `item` tuple. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, with the exception of `current_profit` which is now reduced by the value of `item[1]`.
