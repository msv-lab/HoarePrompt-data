Output State: **Postcondition: `heap` now contains all items except the one that was replaced by `item`, `removed_item` is the item that was heappushed and heappopped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting the first element of `removed_item`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. No other variables are affected. The postcondition remains unchanged except that `max_profit` is now set to the value of `current_profit`.
