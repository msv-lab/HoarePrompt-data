Output State: **`heap` now contains all items except the one that was replaced by `item`, `removed_item` is the item that was heappushed and heappopped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting the first element of `removed_item`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, `combined` remains `True`.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` subtracts the first element of `removed_item` from `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
