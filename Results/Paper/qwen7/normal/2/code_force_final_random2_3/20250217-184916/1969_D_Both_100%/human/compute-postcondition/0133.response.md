Output State: **`heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has one less element, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `removed_item` is True, and `current_profit` is either equal to `max_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` is true, or `current_profit` is equal to `max_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` is false, and `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` has been executed.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` replaces the second smallest element in the heap with `item` and pushes `item` into the heap. This operation modifies the heap such that `item` becomes the new second smallest element. The `combined` list loses one element, and `removed_item` remains True. The `current_profit` calculation logic remains unchanged, depending on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`.
