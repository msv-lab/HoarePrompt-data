Output State: **`heap` now contains all items except the one that was replaced by `item`, `removed_item` is the item that was heappushed and heappopped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted based on the sum of the first and second elements of `item`.**

Explanation: The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs two operations: it pushes the `item` onto the heap and simultaneously pops the smallest item from the heap, assigning it to `removed_item`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`. The `heap` is updated accordingly, excluding the original smallest item and including the new `item`.
