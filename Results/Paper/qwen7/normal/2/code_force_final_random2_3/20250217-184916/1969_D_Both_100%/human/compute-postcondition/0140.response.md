Output State: **`heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has at least one element less, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `removed_item` is True, and `current_profit` is updated based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]`: - If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, then `current_profit` is `max_profit - item[1] - item[0]`. - If `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, then `current_profit` is `max_profit + item[0] - item[1]`**.

Explanation: The code `item = combined.pop()` removes the last element from the `combined` list and assigns it to `item`. This reduces the number of elements in `combined` by one. The `item` is now the new second smallest element in `heap`. The `max_profit` remains unchanged unless `current_profit` is updated based on the condition involving `item[0] + item[1]`. The `removed_item` remains True as the item was successfully removed.
