Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0; `heap` is an empty list; `remaining_items` is an empty list; `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`; `prices` is a list returned by `func_2()` and `n` is the return value of `func_2()` and `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code creates a new list `neg_prices` which contains the negative values of each element in the original `prices` list. The other variables (`test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
