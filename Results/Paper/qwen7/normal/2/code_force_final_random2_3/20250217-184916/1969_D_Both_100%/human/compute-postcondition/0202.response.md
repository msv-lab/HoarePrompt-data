Output State: **`combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `heap` has had its last element replaced by `item`; `current_profit` is increased by the second element of `item` since the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, and `max_profit` is now greater than `current_profit`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.**

Explanation: The code `max_profit = current_profit` simply assigns the current value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. Since `current_profit` was already increased by the second element of `item` (as per the precondition), `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged from their preconditions.
