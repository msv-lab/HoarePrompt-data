Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations performed, and `heap` will contain up to `k` elements, which are the smallest elements from the `combined` list after popping them. If `combined` does not have enough elements to fill the `heap` with `k` elements, the remaining slots in the `heap` will be empty. The `combined` list will be non-empty; `current_profit` is the result of calling `func_3(combined, heap)`**.

This means that the function `func_3` has been called with the arguments `combined` and `heap`. The value returned by `func_3` is now stored in the variable `current_profit`. All other conditions and states remain the same as before the function call.
