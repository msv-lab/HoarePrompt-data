Output State: **`bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, `removed_item` will be True for each iteration where the operation `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` was executed, `test_cases` is decremented by 1 if it was initially greater than 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list; `prices` is updated to a list of negative values of the original `prices`, `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `combined` list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple using the lambda function as the key for sorting. This does not affect the values of other variables, so they remain unchanged. The `combined` list is now sorted, but the exact order depends on the values within the tuples.
