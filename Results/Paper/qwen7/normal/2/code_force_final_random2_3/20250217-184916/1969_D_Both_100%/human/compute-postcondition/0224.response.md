Output State: **`heap` now contains all items except the one that was replaced by `item`, `removed_item` is the item that was heappushed and heappopped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted by either subtracting the first element of `removed_item` and then decreasing by `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, or adding the first element of `item` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, `combined` remains `True`.**

Explanation: The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs two operations: it pushes the `item` onto the heap and simultaneously pops the smallest element from the heap (which is stored in `removed_item`). The `current_profit` is then adjusted based on the condition involving `removed_item` and `item`. The `max_profit` is updated if `current_profit` is greater. The `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, and `combined` remains `True` as no operation affects its state.
