Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), prices (a list of n integers where each price_i is between 1 and 10^9), and bonuses (a list of n integers where each bonus_i is between 1 and 10^9). For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The function processes each test case and returns results based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_4` takes in the number of test cases `t`, along with two lists: `prices` and `bonuses`, each containing `n` integers. For each test case defined by `n` and `k`, the function performs some unspecified operations and returns the results accordingly.
