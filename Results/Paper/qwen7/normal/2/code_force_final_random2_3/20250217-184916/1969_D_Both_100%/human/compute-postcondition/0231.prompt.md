Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the if-else block executes, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations performed, and `heap` will contain up to `k` elements, which are the smallest elements from the `combined` list after popping them. If `combined` does not have enough elements to fill the `heap` with `k` elements, the remaining slots in the `heap` will be empty. The `combined` list will be non-empty; the current value of `current_profit` is either greater than `max_profit` and thus updated, or it remains the same.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `heap` has had its last element replaced by `item`; `current_profit` is increased by the second element of `item` since the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, and `max_profit` is now greater than `current_profit`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `heap` now contains all items except the one that was replaced by `item`, `removed_item` is the item that was heappushed and heappopped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting the first element of `removed_item`, and `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `heap` now contains all items except the one that was replaced by `item`, `removed_item` is the item that was heappushed and heappopped from the heap, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting the first element of `removed_item`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit` if `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit`, `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, `combined` remains `True`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
