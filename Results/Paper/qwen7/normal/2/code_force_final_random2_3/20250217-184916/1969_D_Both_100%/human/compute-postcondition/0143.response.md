Postcondition: `heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has at least one element less, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `removed_item` is True, and `current_profit` is updated based on the value of `item[0] + item[1]`: if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, then `current_profit` is `max_profit - 2 * item[1]`; if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, then `current_profit` is `max_profit + item[0] - item[1]`.
