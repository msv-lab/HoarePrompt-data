Postcondition: **Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `combined` will be empty, `heap` will contain the `k` smallest elements from the original `combined` list (assuming `combined` had enough elements), `k` will be 0, and all other variables (`max_profit`, `test_cases`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `prices`, `bonuses`, `n`) will remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `combined` is non-empty**.
