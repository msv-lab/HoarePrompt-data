Output State: **`k` must be greater than 1; `heap` now contains one additional element which is the popped element from `combined`.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pops an element from the list `combined` and pushes it onto the heap `heap`. Since `k` must be greater than 1 initially, this condition remains unchanged. The heap now includes one more element than before, specifically the element that was popped from `combined`.
