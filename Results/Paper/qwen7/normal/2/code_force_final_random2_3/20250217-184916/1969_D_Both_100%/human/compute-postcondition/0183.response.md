Postcondition: **`k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations performed, and `heap` will contain up to `k` elements, which are the smallest elements from the `combined` list after popping them. If `combined` does not have enough elements to fill the `heap` with `k` elements, the remaining slots in the `heap` will be empty. The `combined` list will be non-empty; `current_profit` is the result of calling `func_3(combined, heap)`. The current value of `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`**.
