Output State: **`combined` is now a list with one less item than before; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `heap` has had its last element replaced by `item`; `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of `item` if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `current_profit` is the sum of the first and second elements of `item`.**

Explanation:
- The `heappushpop` function replaces the smallest element in the heap (`heap`) with the new element (`item`) and returns the removed element (`removed_item`). This means `combined` loses one item, which is the smallest in the heap before the operation, and `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list.
- The value of `current_profit` is updated based on the condition involving the first and second elements of `item`. If their sum is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` decreases by the second element of `item`; otherwise, `current_profit` becomes the sum of the first and second elements of `item`.
