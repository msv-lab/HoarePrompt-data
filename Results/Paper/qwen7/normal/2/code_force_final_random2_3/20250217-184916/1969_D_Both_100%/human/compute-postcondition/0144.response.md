Postcondition: `heap` has had its second smallest element replaced by `combined.pop()`, `combined` now has at least one element less, `item` is the new second smallest element in `heap`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `removed_item` is True, and `current_profit` is updated to `max_profit - 2 * item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, or `max_profit - item[1] - item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and `current_profit` is further increased by `item[0]`.
