Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(k):`. The only variable here is `k`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: From the given information, `k` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0. If `k` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `k` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`
- `heap` is an empty list
- `max_profit` is 0
- `current_profit` is 0
- `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple
- `removed_item` will be True for each iteration where the operation `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` was executed
- `test_cases` is decremented by 1 if it was initially greater than 0
- `remaining_items` is an empty list
- `prices` is updated to a list of negative values of the original `prices`
- `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`
- `k` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`
- `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `k`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
**`k` must be greater than 0**

Final Answer:
State: **`k` must be greater than 0**
