Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `max_profit` remains the highest `current_profit` value encountered during the loop's execution, `current_profit` reflects the net profit calculated based on the operations performed within the loop, `combined` is an empty list, `removed_item` will be True for each iteration where the operation `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` was executed, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, making it `test_cases - 1` if it was initially greater than 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list; `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the result of `func_2()` to the variable `prices`, which is now a list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
