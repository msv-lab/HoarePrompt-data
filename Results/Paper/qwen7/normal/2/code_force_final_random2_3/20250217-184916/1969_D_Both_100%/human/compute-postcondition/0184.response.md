Output State: **`max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations performed, and `heap` will contain up to `k` elements, which are the smallest elements from the `combined` list after popping them. If `combined` does not have enough elements to fill the `heap` with `k` elements, the remaining slots in the `heap` will be empty. The `combined` list will be non-empty; the current value of `current_profit` is now greater than `max_profit`.**

This means that the `max_profit` variable has been updated to hold the value of `current_profit`, while all other conditions and states remain unchanged.
