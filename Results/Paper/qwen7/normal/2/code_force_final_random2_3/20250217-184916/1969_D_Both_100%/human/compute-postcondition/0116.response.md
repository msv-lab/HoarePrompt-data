Postcondition: `item` is the second last element of `combined`, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `combined` is now a list with one less element, and `current_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` minus the second element of `item` or increased by `item[0]`, depending on whether the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0.
