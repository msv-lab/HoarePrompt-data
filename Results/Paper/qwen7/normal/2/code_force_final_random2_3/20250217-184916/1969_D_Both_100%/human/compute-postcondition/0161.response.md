Output State: **`bonuses` is a list of values returned by `func_2()`, `heap` is an empty list, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` reflects the net profit calculated based on the operations performed within the loop, `combined` is an empty list, `removed_item` will be True for each iteration where the operation `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` was executed, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, making it `test_cases - 1` if it was initially greater than 0, and `remaining_items` is an empty list; `prices` is updated to a list of negative values of the original `prices`, `n` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `k` is assigned the value returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `max_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
