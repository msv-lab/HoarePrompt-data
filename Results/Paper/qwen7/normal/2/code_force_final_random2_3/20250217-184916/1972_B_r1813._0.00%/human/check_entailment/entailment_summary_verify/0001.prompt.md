You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`. If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input into a list of strings.
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases where the number of test cases and the size of each test case are not known beforehand.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of coins (`n`) and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It counts the number of coins facing up (`num_up_coins`).

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program checks if the number of facing-up coins (`num_up_coins`) is odd.
   - If `num_up_coins` is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating Alice will win.
   - If `num_up_coins` is even, it appends 'NO' to the results list, indicating Bob will win.

4. **Outputting Results:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results.

### Reasoning:

- The logic in the program correctly identifies whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even.
- If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have an advantage because she can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, eventually forcing Bob into a losing position.
- If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he never loses until the last move, which will be made by Alice.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct according to the problem description.
