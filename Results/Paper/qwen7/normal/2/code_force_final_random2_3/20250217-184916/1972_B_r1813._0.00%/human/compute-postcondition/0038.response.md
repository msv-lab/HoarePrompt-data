Postcondition: `index` is 10, `t` is 0, `n` is data[9], `s` is a string of length data[9] containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list with either 'YES' or 'NO' appended, `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` will have 'YES' appended. Otherwise, `results` will have 'NO' appended.
