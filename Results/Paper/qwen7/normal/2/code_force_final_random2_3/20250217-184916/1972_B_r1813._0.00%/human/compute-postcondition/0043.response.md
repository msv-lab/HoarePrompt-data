Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop is defined as `for result in results:`.
   - The only variable involved in the loop head is `result`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in the `results` list.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` must contain 6 elements.
   - The 6th element is either `'YES'` or `'NO'`.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `results`, the loop will proceed to the next element in the list.
   - After the previous iteration, the 6th element (which is the last element) has been processed.
   - Therefore, the next iteration will process the 5th element.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - The `results` list still contains 6 elements.
   - For the next iteration, the loop will use the 5th element of the `results` list.

### Final State:
- `results` must still contain 6 elements.
- The `result` variable will now refer to the 5th element of the `results` list.

### Answer:
State: **`results` must contain 6 elements, where the 5th element is either `'YES'` or `'NO'`**
