Reasoning:
1. The program reads input and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly counts the number of 'U' (up-facing) coins.
3. The logic to determine the winner is based on whether the number of up-facing coins is odd or even.
4. If the number of up-facing coins is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
5. The program iterates over all test cases, processes each one, and prints the result for each case.
6. The provided comments indicate that the program is in an incorrect state at the end, but this does not affect the correctness of the logic for individual test cases.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the logic in the program is correct. The program processes each test case independently and determines the winner based on the number of up-facing coins, which aligns with the rules provided.

Correctness: **True**
