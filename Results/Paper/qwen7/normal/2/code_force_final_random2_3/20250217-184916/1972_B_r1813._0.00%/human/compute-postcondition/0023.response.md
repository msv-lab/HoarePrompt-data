Output State: **`index` is 8, `t` is 0, `n` is data[8], `s` is a string of length data[8] containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list, `num_up_coins` is the count of 'U' in `s`, `s` is now equal to `data[index]`**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 7, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 8. All other variables remain unchanged.
