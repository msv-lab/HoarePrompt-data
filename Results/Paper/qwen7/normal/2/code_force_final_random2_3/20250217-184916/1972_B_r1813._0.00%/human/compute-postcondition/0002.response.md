Output State: **`index` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from standard input.**

The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, or `data`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
