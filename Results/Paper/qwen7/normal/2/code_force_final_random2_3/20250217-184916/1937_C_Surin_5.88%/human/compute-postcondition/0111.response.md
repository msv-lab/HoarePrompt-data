Output State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `r` is the final input string after all iterations, `prev` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `kp` is 2, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial values of other variables (`g`, `r`, `prev`, `i`, `kp`, `v1`, `v2`) remain unchanged. The variable `i` is updated to 1 because the input operation increments the default value of `i` (which was 0) by 1.
