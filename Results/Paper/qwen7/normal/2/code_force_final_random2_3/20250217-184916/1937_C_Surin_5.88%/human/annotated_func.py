#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, the problem requires interacting with a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) which is a permutation of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\), and allows asking up to \(3n\) queries of the form "? a b c d" to determine the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.

    #State: The loop will have executed for all provided inputs, with the following conditions:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function interacts with a hidden permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1. It asks up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to find the indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices (p_i âŠ• p_j) is maximized. For each input, the function determines and outputs the indices i and j that satisfy this condition.
