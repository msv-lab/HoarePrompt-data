Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts from `1` and goes up to but does not include `n`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer which is at least 2
   - `r` is the input string
   - `prev` is `i`
   - `i` is less than `n`
   - `kp` is 1
   - `v1` is `n-1`
   - `v2` is `n-1`
   - If `r` equals '>', no changes are made to the variables.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one less than `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by `1` and should still be less than `n`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be incremented by `1`, so it will become `i + 1`.
- Since `i` was less than `n` at the end of the previous iteration, `i + 1` should still be less than `n`.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the input string, `prev` is `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, and if `r` equals '>', no changes are made to the variables.**

However, since `i` is incremented by `1` in the next iteration, the condition `i < n` should hold true. Thus, the final state becomes:

State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the input string, `prev` is `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, and if `r` equals '>', no changes are made to the variables.**

To explicitly show the change in `i`:

State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the input string, `prev` is `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, and if `r` equals '>', no changes are made to the variables.**

Note: The actual value of `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration, but the condition `i < n` must still hold true.
