Output State: **`g` is 0, `v1` is `i`, `v2` is `i`, and the input string `r` has been set to `<**.

Explanation: The code `v2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `v2`. The previous values of `g`, `v1`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, `g` is still 0, `v1` is still `i`, `v2` is now `i`, and the input string `r` remains `<`.
