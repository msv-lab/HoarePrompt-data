Based on the initial state provided:

- `g` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer which is at least 2.
- `r` is an input string.
- `prev` is `i`.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `kp` is 1.
- `v1` is `n-1`.
- `v2` is `n-1`.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Let's break down the values being printed:

- `{v1}`: Since `v1` is defined as `n-1`, it will be `n-1`.
- `{i}`: `i` is less than `n`, but its exact value is not specified. We know it is an integer less than `n`.
- `{v1}` again: This will also be `n-1`.
- `{prev}`: `prev` is defined as `i`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a formatted string with these values. 

Output: **? n-1 i n-1 i**
