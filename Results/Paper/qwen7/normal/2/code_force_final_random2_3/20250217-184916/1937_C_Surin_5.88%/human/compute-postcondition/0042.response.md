Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to `i`, and `i` is `n`, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user, which is a string. The other variables (`n`, `prev`, `i`, and the call to `sys.stdout.flush()`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
