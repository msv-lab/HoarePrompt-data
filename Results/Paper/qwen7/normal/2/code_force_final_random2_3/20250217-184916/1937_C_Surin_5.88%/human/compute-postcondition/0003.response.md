Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is an input integer that is at least 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the input to the variable `n`. The precondition that `input()` must return a value that is at least 1 is respected, so `n` will be an integer greater than or equal to 1. The variable `kp` remains unchanged and is still 0.
