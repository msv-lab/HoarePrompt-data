Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `r` is an input string, `prev` is equal to `i`, and `i` is equal to `n`. `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values but flushes the output buffer. Therefore, the values of the variables remain the same as their initial states.
