Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `g` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer which is at least 2
   - `r` is the new input string
   - `prev` is equal to `n`
   - `i` is 2
   - `kp` is 1
   - `v1` is 1
   - `v2` is 1
   - The current value of `r` is '<'

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, if `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is at least 2, and `i` is now 3, the loop will not execute again because `3` is not less than `n` (which is at least 2).

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop will not execute again, we do not need to change the value of `i`. However, we should ensure that all other states remain as they are since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` remains 3
- All other states (`g`, `n`, `r`, `prev`, `kp`, `v1`, `v2`) remain unchanged

**Final State:**
State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the new input string, `prev` is equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `kp` is 1, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 1, and the current value of `r` is '<'**
