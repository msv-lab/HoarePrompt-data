Output State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the input string from the last iteration, `prev` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `kp` is 1, `v1` is 0, `v2` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `v2` is assigned the value of `i`, which is initially 1. After executing the line `v2 = i`, the value of `i` becomes 2 (since `i` was incremented by 1 before this line). All other variables remain unchanged.
