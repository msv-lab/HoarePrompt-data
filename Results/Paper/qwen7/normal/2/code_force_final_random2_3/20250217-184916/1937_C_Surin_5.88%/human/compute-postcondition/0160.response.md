Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is described as being greater than 3 but no explicit value is given for `n`.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
```

Here, `i` is directly provided as 3. However, neither `v1` nor `prev` have any explicit values given in the initial state. Since these values are not defined or provided, we cannot determine their exact values. 

Given this, the output will include placeholders for `v1` and `prev` along with the value of `i` which is 3.

Output: **'? [v1] 3 [v1] [prev]'**
