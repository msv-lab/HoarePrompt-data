Output State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the input string from the last iteration, `prev` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `kp` is 1, `v1` is 0, `v2` is 1**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the standard output. Since no variables are updated or affected by this operation, the values of all variables remain unchanged.
