Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`.
   - The variable `i` is being initialized to 1 and will increment up to but not including `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the loop head, `i` should start at 1.
   - Currently, `i` is set to `n`, which is not correct for the loop to start.

3. **Determine the state of `n`**: The value of `n` must be such that the loop can execute. Since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2 (as given in the problem statement).
   - Currently, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, which is correct for the loop to start.

4. **Check other variables**: The other variables (`g`, `r`, `prev`, `kp`, and `v1`) are not involved in the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the input string from the last iteration, `prev` is equal to `n`, `i` is 1, `kp` is 1, `v1` is 0**
