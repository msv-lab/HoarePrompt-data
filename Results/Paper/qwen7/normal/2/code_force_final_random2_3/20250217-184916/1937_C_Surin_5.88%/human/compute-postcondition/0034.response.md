Output State: **`n` must be at least 2**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the value of `n`. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the terminal or file. However, this operation does not change the value of any variables, including `n`. Therefore, the condition that `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged.
