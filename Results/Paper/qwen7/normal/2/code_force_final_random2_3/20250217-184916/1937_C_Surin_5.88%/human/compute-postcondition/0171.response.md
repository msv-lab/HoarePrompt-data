Functionality: **The function interacts with a hidden permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1. It asks up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to find the indices i and j such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices (p_i âŠ• p_j) is maximized. For each input, the function determines and outputs the indices i and j that satisfy this condition.**
