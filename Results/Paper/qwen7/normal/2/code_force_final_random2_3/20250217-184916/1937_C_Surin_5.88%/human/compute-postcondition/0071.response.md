Output State: **`v2` is equal to `i`, `i` retains its original value.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, this operation does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `v2` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
