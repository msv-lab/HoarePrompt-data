Postcondition: `g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the final input string after all iterations, `prev` is `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`, and the current value of `r` is '>', since the if condition `r == '>'` is met, `prev` is updated to `i`.
