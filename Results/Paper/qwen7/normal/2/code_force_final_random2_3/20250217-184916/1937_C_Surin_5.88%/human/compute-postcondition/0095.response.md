Output State: **`g` is 0, `n` is an input integer which is at least 2, `r` is the final input string after all iterations (current value is '>'), `prev` is `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `n-1`, `v2` is `n-1`**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or conditions. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously written output is actually sent to the terminal or file. Since no variables are assigned new values or conditions are altered, the initial state remains unchanged.
