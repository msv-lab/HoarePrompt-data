Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` is an input string, and if `r` equals '>', `prev` is set to 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or conditions. It simply flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are assigned or modified, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
