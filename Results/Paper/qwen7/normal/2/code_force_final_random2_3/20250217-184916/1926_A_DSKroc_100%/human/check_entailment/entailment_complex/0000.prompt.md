Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings across all test cases are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is the total number of iterations the loop will run, which is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive. `q` ranges from 0 to `t-1` across all iterations. For each iteration, `ac` is the total count of 'A' characters in the input string `s`, and `bc` is the total count of characters in `s` that are not 'A'. After all iterations, if `ac` is greater than `bc` for any iteration, the condition `ac > bc` holds true for at least one iteration. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc` for all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `t` (where `1 ≤ t ≤ 32`) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints 'A' if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', otherwise it prints 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything.
