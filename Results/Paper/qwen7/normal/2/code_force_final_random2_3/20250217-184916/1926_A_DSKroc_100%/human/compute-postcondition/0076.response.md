Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty string, `ac` and `bc` are integers. If the next character `i` is 'A', then `ac` is either 3 or 2 depending on whether the previous character was 'A' (3 if yes, 2 if no), and `bc` is 1 if the previous character was 'A' (otherwise, `bc` is 2). If the next character `i` is not 'A', then `ac` is 1 and `bc` is either 3 or 2 depending on whether the previous character was 'A' (3 if yes, 2 if no).
