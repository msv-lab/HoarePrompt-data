Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cnt` is a list of length `n`, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in `cnt`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The initial state of `n` and `cnt` remains unchanged. The value of `ans` is also not affected by this code snippet.
