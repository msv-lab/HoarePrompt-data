Output State: **`a` is a list starting from the third element, `x` is the second element of the updated list `a`, and `cnt[x]` is now `cnt[x] + 2`**

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value of `cnt[x]` by 1. Since it was previously `cnt[x] + 1`, it now becomes `cnt[x] + 2`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
