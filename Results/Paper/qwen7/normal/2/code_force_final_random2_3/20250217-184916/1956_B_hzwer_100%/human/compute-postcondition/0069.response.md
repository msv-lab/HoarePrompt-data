Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, it checks if each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice and returns a boolean indicating whether all conditions are met for all test cases.**
