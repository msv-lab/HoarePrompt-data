Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `x`.
   - The loop iterates over the list `a`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `x` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `x` is the first element of the list `a`, the next element in the list will be the second element.
   - The loop will execute again with `x` being the second element of the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `a` remains a non-empty list (since it still contains elements).
   - `x` changes to the second element of the list `a`.
   - `cnt[x]` will be incremented by 1 again for the new value of `x`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `x` is the second element of the list `a`, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1**.
