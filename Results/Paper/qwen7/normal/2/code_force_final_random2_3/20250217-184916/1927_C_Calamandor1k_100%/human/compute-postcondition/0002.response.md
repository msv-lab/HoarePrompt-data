Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`.**

The code `unique_a = set(a)` creates a set from the list `a`, removing any duplicate elements. The variable `results` remains an empty list, and the value of `t` and the structure of `cases` remain unchanged. Therefore, `results` is still an empty list, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, and `unique_a` contains the unique elements from the list `a`.
