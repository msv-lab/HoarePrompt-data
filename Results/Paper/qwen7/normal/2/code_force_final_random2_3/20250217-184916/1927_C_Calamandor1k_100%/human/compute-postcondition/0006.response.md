Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`.**

Explanation: The code `only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b` creates a new set `only_a` which contains elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`. The values of `results`, `t`, `unique_a`, and `relevant_b` remain unchanged.
