### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The program correctly parses the input and prepares the data structures (`unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`) for each test case.
   - These structures help in identifying the relevant elements in both arrays that are less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Conditions Check:**
   - The program checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds `k // 2`. If so, it immediately appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
   - It also checks if the total number of distinct elements (from `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`) is less than `k`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it appends 'YES' to the results list.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program correctly generates the output by printing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions checked.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases appropriately, such as when there are not enough elements to satisfy the condition (i.e., the total number of distinct elements is less than `k`).

### Conclusion:

The provided program logic correctly implements the problem requirements and checks all necessary conditions to determine if it is possible to choose the required elements from both arrays. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:

**True**
