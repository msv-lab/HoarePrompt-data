Output State: **`unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from `b` and now also includes elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` list now contains 'YES', 'NO', 'NO'; `k` remains unchanged; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set of elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_b` is a set of elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set of elements that are common between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`. We continue the loop or process.**

The `continue` statement in the code does not change any variable values or affect the current state of the variables. It simply moves the control to the next iteration of the loop or continues with the next step in the process. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous states.
