Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the total number of distinct elements across the sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` by taking the sum of their lengths. However, the actual values of these sets remain unchanged, and no new variables are assigned. Therefore, the only information updated is the calculation of `total_distinct`.
