Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `(n, m, k, a, b)` where:
     - `n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of arrays `a` and `b`.
     - `k` is an integer representing the number of elements to be chosen.
     - `a` and `b` are lists of integers.

2. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over the `cases` list, where each element is a tuple containing `(n, m, k, a, b)`.
   - For each iteration, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` must be valid according to the given constraints.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop head objects**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` must satisfy the constraints: \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot \min(n, m)\), and \(k\) is even.
   - `a` and `b` must be lists of integers where each element satisfies \(1 \leq a_i, b_j \leq 10^6\).

Given these points, the initial state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute properly. Here is the state adjustment:

- `results` is an empty list (this does not affect the loop's execution directly).
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means there are at least `t` test cases in the `cases` list.
- Each test case in `cases` must have valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k` as described above.
- `a` and `b` must be lists of integers within the specified range.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case in `cases`, `n`, `m`, and `k` must satisfy \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), \(2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot \min(n, m)\), and \(k\) is even, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers where each element satisfies \(1 \leq a_i, b_j \leq 10^6\)**.
