Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the chosen elements from both arrays do not include every integer from 1 to k. Specifically, the program checks if the number of elements in `only_a` and `only_b` combined with `both` is at least `k`, but it does not ensure that the elements cover all numbers from 1 to k. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
2
4 4 4
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```
- Expected Output:
```
YES
```
- Program Output:
```
NO
```

In this case, the program incorrectly returns "NO" because it checks the total distinct elements without ensuring that all numbers from 1 to k are covered. The program should verify that the union of the sets of relevant elements from both arrays includes all numbers from 1 to k.
