t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), and k is even. Additionally, each test case consists of two arrays a and b, where a has n integers and b has m integers, with each integer in the range 1 to 10^6. The sum of n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
