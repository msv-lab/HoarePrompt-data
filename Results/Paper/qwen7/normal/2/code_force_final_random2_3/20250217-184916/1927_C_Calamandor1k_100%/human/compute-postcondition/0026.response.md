Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` list now contains 'YES'; `k` remains unchanged; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`; `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are adjusted to the next case in `cases`.**

Explanation: The code `unique_a = set(a)` creates a set from the list `a`, which removes any duplicate elements and stores them in `unique_a`. The other variables (`total_distinct`, `results`, `k`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`) remain in their previous states as described in the initial state.
