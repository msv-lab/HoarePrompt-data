Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, m, k) representing the lengths of arrays a and b, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively. The function returns a list named 'results', where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The length of the 'results' list is equal to the number of test cases in the 'cases' list.**
