Output State: **The `results` list contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration of the loop, based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The length of the `results` list is equal to the number of test cases in the `cases` list.**

**Explanation:**
- The loop iterates over each test case in the `cases` list.
- For each test case, it processes the arrays `a` and `b` to determine if it's possible to choose `k` elements such that no more than half of them come exclusively from `a` or `b`.
- If the conditions are met, it appends `'YES'` to the `results` list; otherwise, it appends `'NO'`.
- After processing all test cases, the `results` list will contain one entry per test case, indicating whether it was possible to choose `k` elements under the given constraints for each case.
- The `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` sets are recalculated for each test case but do not affect the final `results` list once the loop completes.
