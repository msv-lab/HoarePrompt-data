Postcondition: **`unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from `b` and now also includes elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` list now contains 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'; `k` remains unchanged; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set of elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `only_b` is a set of elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`; `both` is a set of elements that are common between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `total_distinct` is recalculated as the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.**
