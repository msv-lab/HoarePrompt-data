Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is as follows:
   - `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.
   - `results` list now contains 'YES'.
   - No changes to `k`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `cases`, which means each tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` from `cases` will be unpacked into the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` respectively.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `cases`, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` will change to the next tuple in `cases`.
   - The variable `k` does not change according to the given information.
   - The `total_distinct` and `results` do not depend on the loop variables directly, so they remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, which is not specified here.

Given this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` list now contains 'YES'; `n` is the next value of `n` in `cases`, `m` is the next value of `m` in `cases`, `k` remains unchanged, `a` is the next value of `a` in `cases`, `b` is the next value of `b` in `cases`.**
