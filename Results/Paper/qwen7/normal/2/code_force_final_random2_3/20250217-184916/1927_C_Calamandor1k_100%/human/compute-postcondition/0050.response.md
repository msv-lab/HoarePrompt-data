Output State: **`unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from `b`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, `results` list now contains 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES', `k` remains unchanged, `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set of elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `relevant_b` is updated to be the set of elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_b` is a set of elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set of elements that are common between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `a` is updated to the next value in the `cases` list, `b` is updated to the next value in the `cases` list, `only_b` is a set of elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`.**

Explanation: The code updates the set `only_b` to contain elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
