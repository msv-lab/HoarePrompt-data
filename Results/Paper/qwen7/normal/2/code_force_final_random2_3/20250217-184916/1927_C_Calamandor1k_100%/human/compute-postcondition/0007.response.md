Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from the list `a`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`.**

Explanation: The code `only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a` creates a new set `only_b` which contains elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`. The values of `results`, `t`, `unique_a`, `relevant_b`, and `only_a` remain unchanged.
