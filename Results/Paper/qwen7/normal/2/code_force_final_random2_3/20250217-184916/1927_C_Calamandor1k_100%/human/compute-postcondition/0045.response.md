Output State: **`unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`, `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`, `results` list now contains 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES', `k` remains unchanged, `unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from `b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set of elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_b` is a set of elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set of elements that are common between `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`, `n` is updated to the next value in the `cases` list, `m` is updated to the next value in the `cases` list, `a` is updated to the next value in the `cases` list, `b` is updated to the next value in the `cases` list.**

Explanation: The code `unique_a = set(a)` creates a new set `unique_a` containing the unique elements from the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
