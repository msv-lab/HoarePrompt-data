Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; the value of `total_distinct` is less than `k`; `'NO'` is appended to the `results` list; we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `total_distinct`, `only_a`, `only_b`, `both`, `k`, `results`, and the value of `total_distinct` being less than `k` and `'NO'` being appended to `results` remain unchanged, these conditions persist. The only additional information is that the loop continues.
