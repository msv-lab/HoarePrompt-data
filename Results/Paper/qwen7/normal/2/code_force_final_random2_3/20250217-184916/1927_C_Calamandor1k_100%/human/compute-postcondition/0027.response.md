Output State: **`unique_b` is a set containing unique elements from `b`; `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` list now contains 'YES'; `k` remains unchanged; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from `a`; `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are adjusted to the next case in `cases`.**

Explanation: The code `unique_b = set(b)` creates a set of unique elements from the list `b`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `total_distinct`, `results`, `k`, `unique_a`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
