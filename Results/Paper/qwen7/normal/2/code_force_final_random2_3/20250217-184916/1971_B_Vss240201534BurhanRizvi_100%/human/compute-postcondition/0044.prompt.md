You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` will be a string that has been processed according to the rules defined within the loop. Specifically, `s` will be transformed in such a way that it no longer contains all the same characters and does not consist of a single repeated character sequence. If the length of `s` was originally greater than 1 and did not have all characters the same, `s` will undergo a series of transformations where its characters are rearranged or shifted to ensure it meets the "Yes" condition criteria. If `s` initially had all the same characters or was a single character, it will remain unchanged or become an empty string due to the conditions in the loop.
    #
    #If the loop runs until `t` (the initial positive integer input) reaches zero, and given the transformations applied in each iteration, `s` will eventually meet the "Yes" condition or remain unchanged based on the initial input constraints. The final state of `s` will depend on the specific sequence of inputs provided during each iteration, but it will always be a valid string that satisfies the loop's criteria.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. Based on `t` and `s`, the function returns specific outputs for different conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
