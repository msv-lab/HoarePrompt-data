You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `s` will be a string that has been processed according to the rules defined within the loop. Specifically, `s` will be transformed in such a way that it no longer contains all the same characters and does not consist of a single repeated character sequence. If the length of `s` was originally greater than 1 and did not have all characters the same, `s` will undergo a series of transformations where its characters are rearranged or shifted to ensure it meets the "Yes" condition criteria. If `s` initially had all the same characters or was a single character, it will remain unchanged or become an empty string due to the conditions in the loop.
    #
    #If the loop runs until `t` (the initial positive integer input) reaches zero, and given the transformations applied in each iteration, `s` will eventually meet the "Yes" condition or remain unchanged based on the initial input constraints. The final state of `s` will depend on the specific sequence of inputs provided during each iteration, but it will always be a valid string that satisfies the loop's criteria.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the string `s` for each test case.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the length of `s` is 1, the program prints 'No', which is correct because there are no other characters to rearrange.
   - If all characters in `s` are the same (e.g., 'aaaaa'), the program also prints 'No' because no rearrangement can produce a different string.

3. **General Case:**
   - For strings with more than one unique character, the program uses `random.sample` to generate a random permutation of the string `s`.
   - If the generated permutation `s2` is the same as `s`, it tries to create a different permutation by rotating the string (i.e., moving the first character to the end).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' followed by the generated permutation `s2`.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Edge Cases:**
  - Single-character strings are handled correctly.
  - Strings with all identical characters are handled correctly.

- **General Case:**
  - The use of `random.sample` ensures that the generated permutation is different from the original string `s` with high probability.
  - The rotation method (`s[1:] + s[0]`) is a simple way to ensure a different string when `s2` is the same as `s`.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program processes each test case independently, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all edge cases and general cases as per the problem description. It ensures that if a different string can be formed, it does so; otherwise, it reports that it's impossible.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
