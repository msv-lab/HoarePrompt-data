Output State: **`s2` is a string obtained by taking all characters of `s` except the first one and appending the first character of `s` to the end.**

Explanation: The code `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` takes the substring of `s` starting from the second character to the end (`s[1:]`) and appends the first character of `s` (`s[0]`) to the end of this substring. This effectively rotates the string `s` by moving its first character to the last position.
