### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Single Character String Case**: The program correctly identifies and handles the case where the string `s` consists of a single unique character. In this case, it prints "No" because there is no way to rearrange a single-character string to be different from itself.

3. **All Characters the Same Case**: The program also correctly identifies and handles the case where all characters in the string `s` are the same. In this case, it prints "No" because there is no way to rearrange such a string to be different from itself.

4. **General Case**: For other cases, the program attempts to generate a new string `s2` by randomly shuffling the characters of `s`. If the shuffled string `s2` is the same as `s`, it tries to shift the first character to the end to ensure a different string. This approach ensures that the generated string `s2` is different from the original string `s`.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints "Yes" followed by the new string `s2` if the conditions are met. Otherwise, it prints "No".

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as strings of length 1 and strings where all characters are the same. It also handles strings of length up to 10, which is within the specified limit.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
