Output State: **`day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 23 adjusted by subtracting 12, and `m` is an input integer; `h` is decreased by 12.**

Explanation: The code `h = h - 12` decreases the value of `h` by 12. The other variables (`day`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged. The value of `h` is adjusted according to its original range and the operation performed.
