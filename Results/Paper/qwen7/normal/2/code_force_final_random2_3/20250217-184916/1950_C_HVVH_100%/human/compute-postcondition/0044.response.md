Output State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 23 (with values greater than 12 adjusted to `h - 12`), and `m` is an input integer, `h` and `m` are updated to the values input by the user separated by a colon.**

Explanation: The code `day = 'AM'` simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `h`, or `m`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 23 (with values greater than 12 adjusted to `h - 12`), and `m` is an input integer remains unchanged. The values of `h` and `m` are updated to the values input by the user, and they are expected to be separated by a colon.
