Reasoning:
1. The function correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
2. The logic for determining whether the time is in the AM or PM period is correct:
   - If the hour `h` is 0, it is treated as 12 AM.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than 12, it is adjusted by subtracting 12 and marked as PM.
   - Otherwise, it is marked as AM, and if the hour is exactly 12, it is also marked as PM.
3. The function prints the time in the correct format with leading zeros for both hours and minutes.
4. The function correctly sets `n` to 0 after processing all test cases, and `day` is updated based on the final hour value.
5. The function does not return any value, which is appropriate since the output is printed directly.

Given these points, the function appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
