Output State: **`day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the input integer `h - 12`, and `m` is the input integer `m`.**

Explanation: The code `h = h - 12` subtracts 12 from the value of `h`. The value of `m` remains unchanged, and the values of `day` and `n` are still as per the initial state since they are not affected by the code.
