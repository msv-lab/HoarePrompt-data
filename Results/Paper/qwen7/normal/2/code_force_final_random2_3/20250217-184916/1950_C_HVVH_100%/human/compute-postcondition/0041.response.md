Output State: **`day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is 12, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `day` to 'AM', but does not affect the values of `n`, `h`, or `m`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and the initial values of `h` and `m` remain unchanged.
