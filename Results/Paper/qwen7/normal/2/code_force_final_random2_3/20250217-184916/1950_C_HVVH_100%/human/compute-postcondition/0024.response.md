Output State: **`day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 23 (with values greater than 12 adjusted to `h - 12`), and `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))` takes an input in the format of hours and minutes separated by a colon and converts them into integers. The values of `day` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `h` is updated to the integer value of the hours part of the input, and `m` is updated to the integer value of the minutes part of the input. If the input hours are greater than 12, `h` is adjusted to `h - 12`. The `day` and `n` variables retain their initial conditions.
