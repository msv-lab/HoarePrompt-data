Postcondition: `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 23 (with values greater than 12 adjusted to `h - 12`), and `m` is an input integer. If `h` is 0, `day` is set to 'AM' and `h` is set to 12. Otherwise, `day` is set to 'PM', and if `h` is greater than 12, it is adjusted to `h - 12`.
