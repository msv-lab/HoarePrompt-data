Postcondition: **`day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 23 (with values greater than 12 adjusted to `h - 12`), and `m` is an input integer.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `h > 12` is true or false, the values of `day`, `n`, `h`, and `m` remain as specified in the precondition.
