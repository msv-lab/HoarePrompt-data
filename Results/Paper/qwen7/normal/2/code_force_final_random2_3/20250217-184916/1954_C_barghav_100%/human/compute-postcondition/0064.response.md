Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(b))`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `len(b)` is 3

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(b)`.
   - Given that `len(b)` is 3, the loop will continue if `i` is less than 3.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `len(b)`, which is 3. Therefore, `i` can be 2, but it cannot be 3 or greater.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 2 for the next iteration.
   - `len(b)` remains unchanged at 3.

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `len(b)` is 3**
