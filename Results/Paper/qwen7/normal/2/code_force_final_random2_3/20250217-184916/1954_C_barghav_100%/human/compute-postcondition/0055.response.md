Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(a))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(a)`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1
   - `len(a)` is known (let's denote it as `L`)

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Given that `i` is now 2, the condition `i < len(a)` will hold true if `len(a)` (denoted as `L`) is greater than 2.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`. `len(a)` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `len(a)` is known**
