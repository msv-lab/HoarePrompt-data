Postcondition: `a` must have at least one character, `i` is 2, and `f` is 1 if `a[2]` is less than `b[2]`. If `a[2] < b[2]`, `f` is set to 1, and either `a[2]` and `b[2]` are swapped (if `a[2] > b[2]`) or they remain unchanged (if `a[2] <= b[2]`). If `a[2] >= b[2]`, `f` remains 0, and `a[2]` and `b[2]` remain unchanged.
