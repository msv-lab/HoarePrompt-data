Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is 2.
2. We also know that `len(b)` is 3, which means the list `b` has 3 elements.
3. The print statement accesses `b[i]`, where `i` is 2.
4. Since `b` has 3 elements, `b[2]` refers to the third element in the list (indexing starts at 0).
5. However, the value of `b[2]` is not explicitly given, so we cannot determine its exact value. But we know it exists and is part of the list.

Given this information, the print statement will output the third element of the list `b`.

Output: **b[2]**
