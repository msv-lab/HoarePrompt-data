Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: After all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of list `a` minus 1. The variable `f` will be 1 if there was at least one instance where `a[i] < b[i]` during the loop's execution; otherwise, `f` will be 0. The lists `a` and `b` will have their elements potentially swapped based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each index `i` from 0 to `len(a) - 1`, if `f` was set to 1 due to `a[i] < b[i]`, the elements at those indices in `a` and `b` will be swapped if `a[i] > b[i]`. Otherwise, the elements will remain unchanged.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of list `a` minus 1, which means `i` is now 2 (since it has been incremented through the loop three times). The value of `f` remains 0 because no instances of `a[i] < b[i]` were found during the loop's execution. The lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged as no swapping occurred since `f` never became 1.
    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` being 2, `len(b)` still being 3, `a` remaining as `[1, 2, 3]`, `b` remaining as `[4, 5, 6]`, and `f` remaining 0.
    print()
    #This is printed: None
