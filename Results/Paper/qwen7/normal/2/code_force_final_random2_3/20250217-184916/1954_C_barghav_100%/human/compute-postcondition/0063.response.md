Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `len(b)` is explicitly given as 3, which means the list `b` has 3 elements.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet is `print(b[i], end='')`.

3. **Explanation**:
   - Since `i` is 1, it refers to the second element in the list `b` (remember, list indices start from 0).
   - The list `b` has 3 elements, but we don't know their exact values. However, we only need to know that there are at least three elements to confirm that `b[1]` is valid.
   - The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function means that no newline character will be added after the printed value, but this does not affect the content being printed.

4. **Output**:
   - The code will print the second element of the list `b`.

Output: **b[1]**
