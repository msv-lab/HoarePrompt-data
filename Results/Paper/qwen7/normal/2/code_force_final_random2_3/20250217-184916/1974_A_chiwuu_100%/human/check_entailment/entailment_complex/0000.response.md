Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code to see if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Initialization**: The code reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Initial Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `t = b` (where `b` is the number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `b` is even, `t = b // 2`.
   - If `b` is odd, `t = b // 2 + 1`. This ensures that we account for the fact that a 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and we need to round up if there's a remainder when dividing by 2.

3. **Calculate Remaining Space**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. This calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1 >= a`, then no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons, so `t` remains the same.
   - Otherwise, we need to calculate how many more screens are required to fit the remaining 1x1 icons (`a - t1`). Since each screen can hold 15 icons, we divide `a - t1` by 15 and add 1 if there's a remainder.

4. **Final Output**: The final value of `t` is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic used in the code, the approach seems to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed. However, let's verify the logic with some test cases:

- For `1 1`: 
  - `b = 1`, so `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`.
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`, which is greater than `a = 1`, so no additional screens are needed. Thus, the answer is `1`.

- For `7 2`:
  - `b = 2`, so `t = 2 // 2 + 1 = 2`.
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 22`, which is greater than `a = 7`, so no additional screens are needed. Thus, the answer is `2`.

- For `12 4`:
  - `b = 4`, so `t = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3`.
  - `t1 = 3 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 31`, which is greater than `a = 12`, so no additional screens are needed. Thus, the answer is `3`.

- For `0 3`:
  - `b = 3`, so `t = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`.
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`, which is greater than `a = 0`, so no additional screens are needed. Thus, the answer is `2`.

- For `8 1`:
  - `b = 1`, so `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`.
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`, which is greater than `a = 8`, so no additional screens are needed. Thus, the answer is `1`.

- For `0 0`:
  - `b = 0`, so `t = 0 // 2 + 1 = 0`.
  - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`, which is greater than `a = 0`, so no additional screens are needed. Thus, the answer is `0`.

Based on the analysis and test cases, the provided code logic matches the problem requirements and produces the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
