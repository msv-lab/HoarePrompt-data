Output State: **`t` is `b / 2`, `t1` is `b * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the input `a`, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `t // 2`, which means `t` is now `b / 2`. The other variables (`t1`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
