To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer.
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an integer from the first input split.
   - `b` is an integer from the second input split.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` remains 1.
   - Otherwise, `t` is set to `1 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1` if `a - t1` is not divisible by 15, or `1 + (a - t1) // 15` if it is divisible.

Given the above conditions, we need to consider the possible values of `t` based on the values of `t1` and `a`.

### Case Analysis:
- **Case 1**: `t1 >= a`
  - In this case, `t` remains 1.
  
- **Case 2**: `t1 < a`
  - Here, we need to evaluate the expression `1 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1` if `a - t1` is not divisible by 15, or `1 + (a - t1) // 15` if it is divisible.
  - Let's denote `r = a - t1`.
  - If `r % 15 != 0`, then `t = 1 + (r // 15) + 1 = 2 + (r // 15)`.
  - If `r % 15 == 0`, then `t = 1 + (r // 15)`.

Since the exact values of `t` and `t1` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `t`. However, we can describe the possible outcomes based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
- If `t1 >= a`, then `t` is 1.
- If `t1 < a`, then `t` is either `2 + (a - t1) // 15` or `1 + (a - t1) // 15`.

Given the nature of the problem, we can express the final output as follows:

Output: **1 if t1 >= a, otherwise 1 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1 if (a - t1) % 15 != 0, or 1 + (a - t1) // 15 if (a - t1) % 15 == 0**
