Output State: **`t` is 1 + (t2 // 15), `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split, `t2` is `a - t1`**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated by adding `t2 // 15` to its original value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet. The condition that `t2` is divisible by 15 is still valid since no operations that could change this condition have been performed.
