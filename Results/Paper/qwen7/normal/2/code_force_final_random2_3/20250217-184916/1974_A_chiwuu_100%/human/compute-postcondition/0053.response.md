Output State: **`t` is `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` is `b * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the input `a`, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input.**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to `t // 2 + 1`. Since `t` was originally `b`, it now becomes `b // 2 + 1`. The other variables (`t1`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
