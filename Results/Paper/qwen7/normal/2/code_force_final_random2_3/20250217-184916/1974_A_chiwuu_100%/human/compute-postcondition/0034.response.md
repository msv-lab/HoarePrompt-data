Output State: **`t` is `b` // 2, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input**.

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to its value divided by 2 using integer division (`//`). The other variables remain unchanged. `t1` is calculated based on the new value of `t` (which is now `b // 2`), but since the exact value of `b` is not specified, `t1` remains as `t * 15 - b * 4`. The conditions for `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as the initial state.
