Output State: **`t` is `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input**.

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `b // 2 + 1`, where `//` denotes integer division. The other variables (`t1`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the executed code.
