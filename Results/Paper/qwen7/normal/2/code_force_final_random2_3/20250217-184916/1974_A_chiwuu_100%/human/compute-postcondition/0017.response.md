Output State: **`t` is 1, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split, `t2` is `a - t1`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a - t1` to `t2`. Since `t1` is defined as `t * 15 - b * 4`, and `t` is 1, `t1` simplifies to `15 - b * 4`. The value of `t2` is thus `a - (15 - b * 4)`, which simplifies to `a - 15 + b * 4`. However, since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we keep them as variables. All other variables remain unchanged.
