Postcondition: `t` is either `b // 2` or `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input. If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `t` is updated to either `b // 2 + (a - t * 15 + b * 4) // 15` or `b // 2 + (a - b * 4) // 15 + 2`, and `t1` remains as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
