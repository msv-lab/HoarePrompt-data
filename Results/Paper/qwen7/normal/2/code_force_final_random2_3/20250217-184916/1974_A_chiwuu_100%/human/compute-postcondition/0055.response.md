Output State: **`t` is either `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` is `15 * (b / 2) - b * 4` or `15 * (b // 2 + 1) - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the input `a`, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t1` based on the current value of `t`. Since `t` can be either `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` will take on two different forms depending on the value of `t`. The other variables remain unchanged.
