You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the final value derived from the last iteration's calculations. The value of `t` will be based on the last input values of `a` and `b`, and will either be `b // 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `b` was even or odd at the start. The exact value of `t` will also depend on the comparison between `t1` (calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`) and `a`, and how many times the inner conditions were met during the iterations. If `t1 < a`, `t` will be incremented by the necessary amount to make `t1` at least equal to `a`, considering the division by 15 and potential remainder.
    #
    #In summary, `t` will reflect the cumulative effect of all iterations, with each step potentially adjusting `t` based on the current values of `a` and `b`, and the outcome of the comparisons within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) and pairs of non-negative integers \( a \) and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates a final value for \( t \) based on the initial value of \( b \), which is adjusted if \( b \) is even or odd. It then compares this adjusted value with \( a \) and further modifies \( t \) if necessary to ensure \( t1 \geq a \), where \( t1 = t \times 15 - b \times 4 \). The function outputs the final value of \( t \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Let's analyze a specific case to demonstrate this:

Consider the input `1 1` (1 application with a 1x1 icon and 1 application with a 2x2 icon).

According to the problem description, a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and we need to fit these icons into a grid of 5x3, which has 15 cells per screen. 

The program calculates the number of full 2x2 icons that can fit in a screen and then tries to fit the remaining 1x1 icons into the remaining space. However, the logic in the program is flawed.

Here is a corrected approach:
1. Calculate how many 2x2 icons can fit into the screens.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space.
4. If there are still 1x1 icons left, calculate additional screens needed.

Let's consider the given program's logic:
- It calculates `t` as the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into half the screen (considering the remainder).
- It then calculates `t1` as the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
- It checks if the remaining 1x1 icons (`a`) can fit into the remaining space (`t1`), and if not, it calculates additional screens needed.

However, this logic does not correctly account for the fact that the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons might not be enough to fit the 1x1 icons, and it does not handle the cases where the remaining space is not sufficient to fit the 1x1 icons properly.

For example, in the case `1 1`, the program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed. A 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, leaving 11 cells. Since 11 cells are not enough to fit another 1x1 icon, the program should output 2 screens, but it outputs 1.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum number of screens needed, making it incorrect.
