Output State: **`t` is either `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` is `15 * (b / 2) - b * 4` or `15 * (b // 2 + 1) - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the input `a`, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input, `t2` is `a - t1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `t2` the value of `a - t1`. Since `t1` is already defined as either `15 * (b / 2) - b * 4` or `15 * (b // 2 + 1) - b * 4`, and `a` is the integer value of the input, `t2` is simply the subtraction of `t1` from `a`. The values of `t`, `t1`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
