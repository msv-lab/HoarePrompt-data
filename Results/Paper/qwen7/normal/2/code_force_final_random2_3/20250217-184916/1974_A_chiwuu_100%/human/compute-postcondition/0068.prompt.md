You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b
        
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the final value derived from the last iteration's calculations. The value of `t` will be based on the last input values of `a` and `b`, and will either be `b // 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `b` was even or odd at the start. The exact value of `t` will also depend on the comparison between `t1` (calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`) and `a`, and how many times the inner conditions were met during the iterations. If `t1 < a`, `t` will be incremented by the necessary amount to make `t1` at least equal to `a`, considering the division by 15 and potential remainder.
    #
    #In summary, `t` will reflect the cumulative effect of all iterations, with each step potentially adjusting `t` based on the current values of `a` and `b`, and the outcome of the comparisons within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and pairs of non-negative integers x and y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of x and y.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
