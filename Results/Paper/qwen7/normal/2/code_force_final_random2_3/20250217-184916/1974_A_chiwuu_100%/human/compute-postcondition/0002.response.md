Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is a string from the first input split, `b` is a string from the second input split.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = input().split()` takes a single line of input and splits it into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter. The first part is assigned to `a` and the second part to `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
