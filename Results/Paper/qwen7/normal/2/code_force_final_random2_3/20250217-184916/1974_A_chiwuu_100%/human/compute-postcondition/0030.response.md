Output State: **`t` is an integer, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the first word from the input split, `b` is the second word from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = input().split()` takes two inputs separated by a space and splits them into two strings, assigning the first string to `a` and the second string to `b`. The values of `t`, `t1`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
