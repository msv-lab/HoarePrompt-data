Postcondition: `t` is an integer, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split. If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` remains 1. Otherwise, `t` is set to `1 + (a - t1) // 15 + 1` if `a - t1` is not divisible by 15, or `1 + (a - t1) // 15` if it is divisible.
