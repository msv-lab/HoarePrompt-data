Output State: **`t` is either `b // 2` or `b // 2 + 1`, `t1` is `t * 15 - b * 4`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer converted from the second word of the input.**

Explanation: The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`. All other variables remain unchanged as well. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
