Postcondition: `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in `l` minus the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` elements in `l`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated according to the difference between the cumulative sums as described.
