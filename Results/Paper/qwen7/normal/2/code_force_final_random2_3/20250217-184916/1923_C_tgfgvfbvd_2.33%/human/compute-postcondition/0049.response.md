Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first integer from the input split, `m` is the second integer from the input split, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop, `a` and `b` are the integers from the next input split, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The other variables (`t`, `l`, `p`, `c`, `x`, `a`, `b`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
