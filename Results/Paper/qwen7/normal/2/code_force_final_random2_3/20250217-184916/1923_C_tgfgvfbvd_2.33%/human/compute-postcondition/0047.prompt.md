Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as there were iterations (in this case, the length of `l` is not specified but must be sufficient for all iterations), `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains a positive integer, `n` and `m` remain as they were initially, `l` is the original list of integers, and `p` contains the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`. The variable `c` will hold the total sum of all elements in `l`, and `x` will be the last element of `l` that was processed.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop, `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `s` is equal to the cumulative sum up to the index `a-2` in the list `p`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to the cumulative sum up to the index `a-2` in the list `p`. After the if-else block executes, if the condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is true, `s` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `m` is -1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged. The postcondition does not change regardless of whether the if condition is met or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` and `b` are the integers from the input split, `m` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, then no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
