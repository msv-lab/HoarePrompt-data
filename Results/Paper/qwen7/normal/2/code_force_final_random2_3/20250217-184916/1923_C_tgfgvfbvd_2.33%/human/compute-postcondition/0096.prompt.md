Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in `l` minus the cumulative sum of the first `a-2` elements in `l`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, the value of `s` is adjusted accordingly. If the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))` is true, the program executes the if part; otherwise, it executes the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 1, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`, and after executing the if statement, if `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `a - 2 < 0`, then `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is updated to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `a - 2 < 0`, `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
