Output State: **`c` is the initial value of `c` plus `x`, `l` must contain at least one element**.

Explanation: The code `c += x` increments the value of `c` by the value of `x`. Since `x` is the first element of the list `l`, `c` is updated by adding the value of `x` to its current value. The list `l` still contains at least one element, which is `x`.
