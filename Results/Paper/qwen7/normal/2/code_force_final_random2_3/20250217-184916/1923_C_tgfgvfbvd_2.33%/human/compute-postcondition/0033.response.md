Postcondition: `a` is the first integer from the input split, `b` is the second integer from the input split, `m` is -1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s` is adjusted accordingly. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.
