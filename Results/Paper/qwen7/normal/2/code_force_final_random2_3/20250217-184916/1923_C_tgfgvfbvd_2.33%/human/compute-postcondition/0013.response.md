Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` plus the first element in the list `l` and then appended with the value of `c` plus the third element in the list `l`, `c` is the value of `c` plus the third element in the list `l`, `x` is the third element in the list `l`, `p` is updated by appending the value of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. The value of `c` is updated to be the value of `c` plus the third element in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
