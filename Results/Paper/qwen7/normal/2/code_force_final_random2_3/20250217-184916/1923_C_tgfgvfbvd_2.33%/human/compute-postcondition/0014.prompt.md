Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split, `p` is an empty list, `c` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in l:
    c += x
    p.append(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing the value of `c`, `c` is the value of `c` plus the first element in the list `l`, `x` is the first element in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` plus the first element in the list `l`, `c` is the value of `c` plus the first element in the list `l`, `x` is the second element in the list `l`, and `p` has appended the value of `c`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least three elements, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` plus the first element in the list `l` and then appended with the value of `c` plus the third element in the list `l`, `c` is the value of `c` plus the third element in the list `l`, `x` is the third element in the list `l`, `p` is updated by appending the value of `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
