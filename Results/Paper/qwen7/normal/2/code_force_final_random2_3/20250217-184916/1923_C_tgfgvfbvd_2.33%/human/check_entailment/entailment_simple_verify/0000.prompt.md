You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.

            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `c` will be the sum of all elements in the list `l`, and `p` will be a list containing the cumulative sums of the elements in `l`. The variable `m` will hold the total number of iterations the loop executed. For each query, the variable `s` will be calculated as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` and checked against the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))`. If the condition is met, 'YES' will be printed; otherwise, 'NO'. After processing all queries, the loop will terminate, and the final state of `m` will reflect the total number of queries processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the given problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray, which is not sufficient to ensure that the subarray is good. 

To be good, the subarray must meet the following criteria:
1. The sum of the elements in the subarray must be equal to the sum of the corresponding elements in another array \(b\).
2. No element in the subarray can be equal to the corresponding element in \(b\).
3. All elements in \(b\) must be positive.

The program only checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length, which does not guarantee that the subarray can be transformed into another array \(b\) satisfying the above conditions. For example, consider the subarray [1, 2, 1, 4, 5] from the given example. The subarray [1, 2, 1] has a sum of 4 and a length of 3, but it cannot be transformed into another array \(b\) where all elements are positive and different from the original subarray elements. Therefore, the program incorrectly prints 'YES' for the subarray [1, 2, 1], which should be 'NO'.
