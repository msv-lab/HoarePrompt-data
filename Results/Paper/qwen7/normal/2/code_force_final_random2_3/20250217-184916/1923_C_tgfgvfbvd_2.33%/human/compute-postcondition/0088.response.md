Output State: **`c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` must be greater than 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]**.

Explanation: The code `s -= p[a - 2]` subtracts the value of `p[a - 2]` from `s`. Given that `s` was previously equal to `p[b - 1]`, after executing the code, `s` becomes `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
