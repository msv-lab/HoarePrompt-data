Output State: **`c` is increased by `x`, `l` must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing the value of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(c)` appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `c` was already increased by `x` in the initial state and `l` must have at least one element (though it's not directly affected by this line of code), the only change is that `p` now contains the value of `c`.
