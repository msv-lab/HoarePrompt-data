Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is an integer input from the second split, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as there were iterations (in this case, the length of `l` is not specified but must be sufficient for all iterations), `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is the final cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `x` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed during the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains a positive integer, `n` and `m` remain as they were initially, `l` is the original list of integers, and `p` contains the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`. The variable `c` will hold the total sum of all elements in `l`, and `x` will be the last element of `l` that was processed.
