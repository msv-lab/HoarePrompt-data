Output State: **`m` must be at least 4, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the second tuple is (`a3`, `l3` + (`a3`,)).**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple to the list `val`. The new tuple contains `a3` and the list `l3` concatenated with another instance of `a3`. Therefore, `val` now contains two tuples: the first one is the original tuple (`a3`, `l3`), and the second one is the updated tuple (`a3`, `l3` + (`a3`,)). The values of `m`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.
