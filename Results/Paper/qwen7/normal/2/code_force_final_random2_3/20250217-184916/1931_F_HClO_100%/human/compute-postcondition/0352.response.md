Output State: **`val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is between 0 and `n-1` inclusive, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block provided, the `break` statement simply indicates that we are breaking out of the context in which it was placed (likely a loop or conditional structure). All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
