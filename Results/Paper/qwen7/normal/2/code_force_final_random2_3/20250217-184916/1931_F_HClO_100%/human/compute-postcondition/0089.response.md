Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2 and `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `idx1` is set to `i + p1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, or `idx2` is set to `i + p2` if `l1[i + p1] != a2`. If either `idx1 >= 0` or `idx2 >= 0` is true, we break out of the loop or if statement we were inside.
