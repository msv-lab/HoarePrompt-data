Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `m` must be at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing five tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the second tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the third tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the fourth tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the fifth tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `m` will be at least 5, as it starts from the minimum required value to enter the loop and increases by 1 with each iteration. The variable `a3` and the list `l3` remain the same throughout the loop, being the first integer and the rest of the integers from the input, respectively. The list `val` accumulates tuples of `(a3, l3)` for each iteration of the loop, resulting in a final list of five such tuples.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` contains at least one tuple (though it contains five), and if the current list `l3` is not equal to the list generated by excluding `a3` from the original list `l`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the second integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input corresponding to the second tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list of integers from `l` excluding `a3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the next tuple in `val` corresponding to the second tuple in `val`, and if `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
