Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a3` will be an integer from each input split, `l3` will be a list of integers from each input split, `val` will be a list containing tuples `(a3, l3)` for each iteration of the loop, and the length of `val` will be equal to `m - 2`.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `val` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, and the length of `val` is exactly `m - 2`. After executing the if-else block, the current state of `l3` is such that it either contains all elements of `l` that are not equal to `a3`, or we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `val` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, and the length of `val` is exactly `m - 2`. At the start of the next iteration, `a3` is the next integer in the list and `l3` is the corresponding list of integers. If `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `val` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, and the length of `val` is exactly `m - 2`. At the start of the next iteration, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`, and if `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
