Postcondition: `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `idx1` is either the new value of `i + 1` or updated to `i` if `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx2` is updated to `i` if `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `p2` is set to 1 if `l1[i + p1] != a2`, and `p1` and `p2` remain as they were, and `n` remains unchanged. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is updated to `i + p1`.
