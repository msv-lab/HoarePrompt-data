Output State: `m` must be at least 4, input() function waits for user input three times.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `m-2` times), the value of `m` must still be at least 4 for the loop to run fully. The input() function is called three times as specified in the loop, waiting for user input each time.
