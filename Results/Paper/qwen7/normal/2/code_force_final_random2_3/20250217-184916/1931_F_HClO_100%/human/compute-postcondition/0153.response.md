Output State: **`m` must be at least 4, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-3` iterations, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `m` or `val`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
