Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is an empty list.
- `a3` is an integer from the input.
- `l3` is a list of integers.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer with the value 2.
- `t` is 0.
- `a1` is an integer from the input.
- `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`.
- `a2` is an integer from the input.
- `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces.
- `idx1` is `n - 2`.
- `idx2` is `n - 2`.
- `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 based on the last comparison inside the loop.
- `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1` or the condition `i + max(p1, p2) <= n - 1` is met, leading to a break.

The `print('yes')` statement is executed directly without any dependencies on the other variables or objects listed. Therefore, it will simply print the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
