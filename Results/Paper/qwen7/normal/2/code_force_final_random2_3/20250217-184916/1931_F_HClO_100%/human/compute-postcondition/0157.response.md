Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be at least 4, meaning `m` could be 4 or any integer greater than 4.
- `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-4` iterations.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('no')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'` regardless of the values of `m` and `val`.

Output: **no**
