Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1; `idx1` is `i + 1`; `p1` is 1; `p2` remain as they were; `n` remains unchanged.**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value 1 to `p1`. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `i`, `idx1`, `p2`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
