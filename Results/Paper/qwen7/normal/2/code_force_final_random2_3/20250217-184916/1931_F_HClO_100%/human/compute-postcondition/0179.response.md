Output State: `m - 2` must be greater than or equal to 1, `val` is a list of tuples that must contain at least `m - 2` tuples, an input value is taken from the user `m - 2` times and stored in the variable `input` for each iteration.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `m - 2` must still be greater than or equal to 1. The list `val` will contain exactly `m - 2` tuples as it did after the first iteration. The user will have provided `m - 2` inputs, one for each iteration of the loop, which are stored in the variable `input` for each respective iteration.
