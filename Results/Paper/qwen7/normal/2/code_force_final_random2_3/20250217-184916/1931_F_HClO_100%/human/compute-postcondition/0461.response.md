Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is at least 5, meaning `m` can be any integer greater than or equal to 5.
- `a3` is the second integer from the input.
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input corresponding to the second tuple in `val`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'no'`. Since no other variables or conditions affect this print statement, the output will be the literal string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
