Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is 1, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or assigned within the scope of the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, and `m` is 1 remains valid after the `continue` statement is executed.
