Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `val` is an empty list or a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`. `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input. `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer minus 1 if the if condition is false, otherwise it remains the same. `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, and `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 based on the last comparison inside the loop. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `l2` has had `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l` is now equal to `l2`. Otherwise, `val` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` must be at least 2, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `val` is a list containing one tuple (a3, l3)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be at least 4, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`), and the third tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
