Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 based on the last comparison inside the loop, `i` is at n - 1 or the condition i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1 is met, leading to a break, and `idx1` is less than `idx2`; `l2` has had `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l` is now equal to `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` simply assigns the value of `l2` to the variable `l`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, all the previous states remain unchanged except for `l`, which is now equal to `l2`.
