Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is either `-1` or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not `-1` and is either `n - 2` or another valid index, and `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, the current value of `a1` is less than the current value of `a2` in the list `l3`.
