Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer with the value 2, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `l` is now equal to `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` simply assigns the value of `l2` to the variable `l`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
