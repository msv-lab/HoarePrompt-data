Postcondition: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the next tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the next tuple in `val` corresponding to the second tuple in `val`, and if `l3` is not equal to the list of integers from `l` excluding `a3`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
