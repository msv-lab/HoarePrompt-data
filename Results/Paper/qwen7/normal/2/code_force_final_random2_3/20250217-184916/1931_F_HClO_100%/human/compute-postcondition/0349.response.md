Output State: **`val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.**

The code initializes two variables `p1` and `p2` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
