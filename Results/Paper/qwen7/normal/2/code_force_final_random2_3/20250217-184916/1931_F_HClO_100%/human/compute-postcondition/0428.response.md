The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since the exact loop structure is not provided, we can infer that the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables outside the loop. The variables `p1` and `p2` could potentially be reset to 0 due to the nature of the `continue` statement within a loop, but without the loop details, we cannot specify their exact values.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the implicit understanding that the loop continues to the next iteration without executing the remaining code inside the current iteration.

Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer with the value 2, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2, and the loop continues to the next iteration.**
