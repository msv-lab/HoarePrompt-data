Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variables `a3` and `l3`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(a3, l3)` in the list `val`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `m` is at least 5.
   - `a3` is the first integer from the input.
   - `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.
   - `val` contains at least one tuple (though it contains five).
   - If the current list `l3` is not equal to the list generated by excluding `a3` from the original list `l`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each tuple in `val`, the next tuple `(a3, l3)` will be taken from `val`.
   - Therefore, `a3` will be the second element of the next tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` will be the list of remaining integers corresponding to the next tuple in `val`.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `val` must contain at least one more tuple.
   - Since `val` contains at least one tuple initially and we haven't specified any conditions that would remove tuples from `val`, we assume `val` still contains at least one tuple.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next tuple in `val`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the second integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input corresponding to the second tuple in `val`**.
