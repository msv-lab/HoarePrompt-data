Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `idx2` is `i`, `idx1` is the new value of `i + 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were, and `n` remains unchanged, `p2` is now 1.**

This means that the value of `p2` has been explicitly set to 1, while all other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
