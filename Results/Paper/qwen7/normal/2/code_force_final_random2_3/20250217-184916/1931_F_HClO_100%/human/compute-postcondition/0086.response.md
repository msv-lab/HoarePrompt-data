Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2 and `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is set to `i + p1`. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to `i + p2`. We break out of the loop or if statement we were inside.**

The `break` statement causes the loop or if statement to exit without changing the values of `n`, `i`, `l1`, `p1`, `a2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `p2`. The postcondition remains the same, and we simply note that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
