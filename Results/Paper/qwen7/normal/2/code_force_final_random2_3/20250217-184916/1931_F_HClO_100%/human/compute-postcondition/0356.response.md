Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `i` is between 0 and `n-1` inclusive, and the other variables retain their initial states.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` is between 0 and `n-1` inclusive, after executing the code, `idx1` and `idx2` will also be within this range. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
