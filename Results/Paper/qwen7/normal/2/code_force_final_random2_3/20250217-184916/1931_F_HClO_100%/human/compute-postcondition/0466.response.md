Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is at least 5.
- `a3` is the first integer from the next tuple in `val`.
- `l3` is the list of remaining integers from the next tuple in `val` corresponding to the second tuple in `val`.

The print statement is simply `print('no')`.

Since the print statement is explicitly printing the string `'no'`, regardless of the values of `m`, `a3`, and `l3`, the output will be:

Output: **no**
