Output State: **`a3` is a new integer obtained from the first input split by spaces, `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs split by spaces, `i` is `n-2`, `p1` and `p2` will either both be 0 (if no matches were found that satisfied the conditions in the loop), or one of them will be 1 (if a match was found and the corresponding index was updated), `idx1` is the index where the condition `l3[i + p1] == a1` was last satisfied, `idx2` is now `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list, and `l` is now equal to `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` simply assigns the value of `l1` to `l`. This does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `a3`, `l3`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `val` remain unchanged. The only change is that `l` is now equal to `l1`.
