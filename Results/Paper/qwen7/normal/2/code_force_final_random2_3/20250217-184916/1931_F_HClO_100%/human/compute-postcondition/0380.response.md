Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `idx2` is `i`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `idx2 = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1` according to the precondition) to `idx2`. No other changes occur to the variables. The condition `if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` remains as a postcondition, but since it is not relevant to the assignment of `idx2`, it is not included in the output state.
