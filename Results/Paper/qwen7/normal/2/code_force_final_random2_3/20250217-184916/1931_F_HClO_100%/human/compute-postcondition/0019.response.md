Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` must be greater than 3, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`, `_` is 2, a new string input is taken but its value is not assigned to any variable.**

The `input()` function reads a line of input from the user, but since the input is not assigned to any variable, it does not affect the existing variables. The new string input is simply read but not stored in any variable.
