Output State: **`m` must be at least 4, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-4` iterations, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `m` or `val`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is the indication of breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
