Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is greater than 5, `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `l11` is a list of elements in `l1` excluding `a2`, `_` is 4, a new string input is taken but its value is not assigned to any variable.

This final output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, with `m` being incremented each time the loop runs. Since the loop runs `m - 2` times, if it executes 3 times as mentioned, then `m` must be greater than 5 (as `m - 2` would be 3, making `m` 5 or more). After 5 iterations (`m - 2 = 5`), `_` will be 4, and the loop will stop taking additional inputs since the loop condition `m - 2` will no longer be satisfied.
