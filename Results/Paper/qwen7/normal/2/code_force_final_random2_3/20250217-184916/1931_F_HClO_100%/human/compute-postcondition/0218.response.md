Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 1`.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` plus the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is broken.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is about to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1.
   - Given that `i + max(p1, p2) = n - 1`, the new value of `i` will be `n - 2` (since `i` is incremented by 1).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` becomes `n - 2`.
   - `n` remains the same (at least 1).
   - `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The new state should reflect these changes.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged**.
