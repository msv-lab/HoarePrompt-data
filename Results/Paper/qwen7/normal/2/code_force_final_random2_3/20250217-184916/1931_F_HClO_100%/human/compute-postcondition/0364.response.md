Output State: **`idx2` is `i`; `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is between 0 and `n-1` inclusive, and either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The line `idx2 = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
