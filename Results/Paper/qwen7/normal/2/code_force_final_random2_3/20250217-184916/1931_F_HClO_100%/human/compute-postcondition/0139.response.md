Output State: **`m` must be at least 3, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (`a3`, `l3` + (a3, l3)).**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `a3` and `l3` are unchanged, the only change is that the tuple `(a3, l3)` is added to the existing list `val`.
