Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is either `-1` or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not `-1` and is either `n - 2` or another valid index, and `val` is an empty list, `l` is assigned the value of `l1`.**

The code `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to the variable `l`. No other variables are affected, and the condition that `idx1` is greater than `idx2` remains true since no changes were made to `idx1` or `idx2`. The value of `val` remains an empty list as no operations were performed on it.
