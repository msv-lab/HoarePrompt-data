Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(a3, l3)` in the `for` loop statement. This means the variables `a3` and `l3` are the only ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are more elements in the `val` list. The `val` list contains tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-3` iterations. Therefore, the loop will continue until all tuples in `val` have been processed.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be at least 4.
   - `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-3` iterations.
   - If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop processes one tuple per iteration, we need to remove one tuple from `val`.
   - `a3` and `l3` will be updated to the next tuple in `val`.

Given that `val` contains tuples for `m-3` iterations, and assuming we have processed one tuple in the previous iteration, the new state will be:

- `m` remains at least 4.
- `val` now contains `m-4` tuples.
- `a3` and `l3` are updated to the next tuple in `val`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`m` must be at least 4, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-4` iterations.**
