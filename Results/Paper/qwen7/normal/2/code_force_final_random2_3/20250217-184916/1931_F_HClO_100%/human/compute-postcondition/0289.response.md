Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is `-1`, `idx2` is either `n - 2` or another valid index, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the elements from the input split and converted to integers, `l2` is a list with `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l2.index(a1)` is greater than or equal to `l2.index(a2)`**.

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the element `a2` at the index `idx1` in the list `l2`. Given that `idx1` is either `-1` or `n - 2`, and since inserting at `-1` means appending to the end of the list, `l2` will now have `a2` appended at the end if `idx1` was `-1`. If `idx1` was `n - 2`, `a2` is inserted at that position. The other variables remain unchanged as per the precondition.
