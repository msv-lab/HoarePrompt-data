Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n - 1`
- `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged
- `idx1` is either `-1` or `n - 2`
- `idx2` is not `-1` and is either `n - 2` or another valid index
- `val` is an empty list
- `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`
- `m` is equal to 2

The `print('yes')` statement simply outputs the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
