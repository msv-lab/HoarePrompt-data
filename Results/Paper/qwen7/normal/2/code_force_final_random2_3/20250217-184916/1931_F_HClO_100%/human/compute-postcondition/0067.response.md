Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `idx1` is set to 1. Otherwise, `idx2` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `p1`, `a2`, `l1`, `idx1`, or `idx2`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional statement is mentioned, we assume it breaks out of the context where the condition was being checked.
