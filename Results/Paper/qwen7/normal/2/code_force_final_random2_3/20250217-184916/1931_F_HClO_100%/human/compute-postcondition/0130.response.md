Output State: **`a3` is a new integer obtained from the first input split by spaces, `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs split by spaces, `i` is `n-2`, `p1` and `p2` will either both be 0 (if no matches were found that satisfied the conditions in the loop), or one of them will be 1 (if a match was found and the corresponding index was updated), `idx1` and `idx2` will be updated based on the conditions `l3[i + p1] == a1` and `l3[i + p1] == a2`, `val` is a list containing a tuple `(a3, l3)`, `l` is now equal to `l2`, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `idx1` is updated to the index where `l3[i + p1] == a1` was last satisfied. Otherwise, `idx1` is updated to the index where `l3[i + p1] == a2` was last satisfied, and `l2` has had the value of `a2` inserted at the index `idx1`.**

This output state reflects that the `val` list has been appended with a tuple containing `a3` and `l3`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, with the exception of `val` which now contains the specified tuple.
