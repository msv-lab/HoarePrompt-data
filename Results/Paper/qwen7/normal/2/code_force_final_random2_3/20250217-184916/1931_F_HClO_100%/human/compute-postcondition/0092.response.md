Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2 and `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then either `idx1` is set to `i + p1` if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, or `idx2` is set to `i + p2` if `l2[i + p2] == a1`. Additionally, if `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the if condition is not met, the postcondition remains unchanged.
