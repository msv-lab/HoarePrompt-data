Output State: **`i` is equal to `n - 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain unchanged, `idx1` is either `-1` or `n - 2`, `idx2` is not `-1` and is either `n - 2` or another valid index, and `val` is an empty list. Additionally, `idx1` is greater than `idx2`; `a1` is inserted into the list at index `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. Since `idx2` is either `n - 2` or another valid index, `a1` is inserted at that position. The other variables (`i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `val`) remain unchanged. The condition that `idx1` is greater than `idx2` also remains valid.
