Output State: **`m` is reduced by 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `val` is a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each of the `m-2` iterations, `t` is `t-1`.**

Explanation: The code `input()` simply waits for an input from the user and assigns it to the default variable `input()`. Since no variable is explicitly assigned the value of `input()`, the input is stored in the default `input()` variable, which is not used anywhere else in the given code snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `n` is now an integer input by the user. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
