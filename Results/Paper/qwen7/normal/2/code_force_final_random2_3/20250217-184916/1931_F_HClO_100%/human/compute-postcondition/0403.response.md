Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 1, `idx1` is the new value of `i + 1`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were, and `n` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that was being executed. The values of `i`, `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the loop or conditional block is exited.
