Output State: **`m` must be at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `val` initially contained one tuple (`a3`, `l3`), after appending, `val` now contains two identical tuples: (`a3`, `l3`). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
