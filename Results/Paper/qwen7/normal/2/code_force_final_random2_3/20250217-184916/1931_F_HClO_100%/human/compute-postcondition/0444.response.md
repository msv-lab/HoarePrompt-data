Output State: **`m` must be at least 2, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input, `val` is a list containing one tuple (a3, l3)**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Since `a3` is an integer from the input and `l3` is a list of integers from the input, the list `val` now contains exactly one tuple consisting of `a3` and `l3`. The conditions and values of `m` and `a3` remain unchanged, and `l3` retains its list of integers.
