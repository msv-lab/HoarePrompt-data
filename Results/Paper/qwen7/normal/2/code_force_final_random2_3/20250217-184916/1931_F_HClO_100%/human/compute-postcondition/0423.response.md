Output State: **`val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers, `n` is the input integer, `m` is the input integer, `t` is 0, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1 based on the last comparison inside the loop, and `l1` now has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code inserts `a1` into the list `l1` at the index `idx2`. Since `idx1` and `idx2` are the same (both are `n - 2`), `a1` is inserted at that specific index in `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
