Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of an integer input, and all other variables remain unchanged.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning this value to the variable `t`. Since no other variables are mentioned or modified, their states remain as described in the initial state.
