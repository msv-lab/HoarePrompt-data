Postcondition: **After executing the if-else block, `i` is `n-2`, `p1` and `p2` will either both be 0 (if no matches were found that satisfied the conditions in the loop), or one of them will be 1 (if a match was found and the corresponding index was updated). The values of `idx1` and `idx2` will be updated to the indices where the conditions `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1` were last satisfied, respectively. If no such indices were found, `idx1` and `idx2` will remain -1. `val` is an empty list.**
