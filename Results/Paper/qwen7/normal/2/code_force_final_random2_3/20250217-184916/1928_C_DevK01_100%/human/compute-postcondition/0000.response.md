Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q); `M` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `M`. This does not affect the values of `q` and `x`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
