The loop condition is `i < w`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `w`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `w` must be greater than 2.

To ensure the loop can execute again, `w` must be greater than 3. The other states (`i`, `q`, and `M`) do not affect the loop condition directly and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `w` must be greater than 3.

State: **`i` is 3, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` must be greater than 3, and `M` is a list containing the integers 1 and `q // 2`.**
