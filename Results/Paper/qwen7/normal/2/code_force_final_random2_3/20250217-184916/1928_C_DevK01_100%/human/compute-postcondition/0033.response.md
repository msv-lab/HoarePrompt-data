Postcondition: `i` is 3, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` must be greater than 3, and `M` is a list containing the integers 1, `q // 2`, 3, and `q // 3`. If `q // i >= x - 1` holds true, then the condition is maintained as specified. If the condition does not hold, the list `M` remains unchanged.
