Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from being correct:

1. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(y-2)//2` and `(n-x)//2`. However, the logic to determine the valid `k` values from these divisors is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if i >= x - 1` and `if q // i >= x - 1` do not correctly map to the required conditions for `k`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, when `x` is close to `n`, the logic to add elements to `L1` might miss some valid `k` values.

3. **Logic for Valid `k` Values**: The logic to determine valid `k` values from the divisors is incorrect. The current implementation checks if the divisor is greater than or equal to `x-1`, which does not align with the problem statement.

4. **Set Conversion**: The use of `set` to remove duplicates before calculating the length is unnecessary and may not handle the problem correctly due to the specific nature of the divisors.

### Correct Solution:

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        y //= 2
        for k in range(x - 1, y + 1):
            if (y - k) % (2 * k - 2) == 0:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:

1. **Calculate `y`**: Calculate `y = (n + x) // 2`.
2. **Loop through Possible `k` Values**: Loop through possible values of `k` starting from `x-1` to `y` (inclusive).
3. **Check Condition**: For each `k`, check if `(y - k)` is divisible by `2*k - 2`. If it is, then `k` is a valid value.
4. **Count Valid `k` Values**: Count and print the number of valid `k` values.

This approach ensures that all valid `k` values are correctly identified and counted.
