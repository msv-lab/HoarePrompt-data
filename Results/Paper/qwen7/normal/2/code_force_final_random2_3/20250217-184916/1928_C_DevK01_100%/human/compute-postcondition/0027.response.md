Output State: **`i` is 3, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` must be greater than 2, and `M` is a list containing the integers 1 and `q // 2`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `q`, `w`, and the list `M` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
