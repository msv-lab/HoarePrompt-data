Output State: **`i` is 3, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` must be greater than 3, and `M` is a list containing the integers 1, `q // 2`, 3, and `q // 3`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`. Given that `i` is 3, `M += [q // 3]` is executed. Since `q` is a perfect square greater than 1, `q // 3` is a specific value that is added to the list `M`. The other variables remain unchanged.
