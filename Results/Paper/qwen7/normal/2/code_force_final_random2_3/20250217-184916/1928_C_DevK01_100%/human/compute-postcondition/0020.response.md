Output State: **`i` is 2; `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1; `w` must be greater than 2; `M` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, and `q // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `M`. Initially, `M` contains `[1, q // i]`. Since `i` is 2, `q // i` is `q // 2`. Therefore, after appending, `M` becomes `[1, q // 2, 2]`. The values of `i`, `q`, and `w` remain unchanged.
