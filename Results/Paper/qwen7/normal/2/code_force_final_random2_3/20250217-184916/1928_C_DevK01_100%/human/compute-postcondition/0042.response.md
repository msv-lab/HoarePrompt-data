Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. It returns a list `M` containing all integers from 1 up to and including the square root `w` of `q`, where `q` is a perfect square greater than 1 and `w` is an integer. If the square root `w` of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `w` is included in the list `M`. The function iterates through all divisors of `q` up to `w`, adding those that meet the condition to the list `M`.**
