Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` and its usage in the main loop do not accurately determine the number of valid `k` values for the given constraints.

Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid `k` Values**: The function `func_1` calculates potential values of `k` based on certain conditions, but these conditions are not correctly derived from the problem statement. The logic inside `func_1` does not properly account for the repeating pattern of settling every `2k-2` positions.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Position and Number Constraints**: The main logic in the program does not correctly handle the constraints and the repeating pattern of settling. It incorrectly uses the formula `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` without properly accounting for the periodicity and the exact placement of `x` within the repeating sequence.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:
- Input: `100 99`
- Expected Output: `0`

Given the position `x = 99`, the program should determine if there exists any `k` such that the settling pattern fits the given position and number. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate this.

A correct implementation would involve:
- Determining the period of the settling pattern (`2k-2`).
- Checking if the given position and number fit into this pattern correctly.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the valid `k` values, it fails for at least one input case, making the program incorrect.
