Output State: **`i` is 2, `q` must be a perfect square greater than 1, `w` must be greater than 2, `M` is a list containing the integers 1, 2, `q // 2`, and `q // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`. Given that `i` is 2, `q // i` is equivalent to `q // 2`. Since `q` is a perfect square greater than 1, `q // 2` is also included in the list `M`. The values of `i`, `q`, `w`, and the existing elements of `M` remain unchanged.
