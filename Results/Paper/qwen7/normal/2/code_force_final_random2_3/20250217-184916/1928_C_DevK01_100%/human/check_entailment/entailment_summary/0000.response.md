Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position and the number he received during the "first-k-th" settling process match the given conditions.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling process repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) Vasya received must fit within this repeating pattern.
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of a specific value related to \( n \) and \( x \).

3. **Analysis of `func_1` Function**:
   - The function calculates divisors of a value derived from \( q = \frac{y-2}{2} \) and checks if they are valid \( k \) values.
   - It includes the square root of \( q \) if it meets the condition and adds other divisors that meet the criteria.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly processes each test case by calculating \( y = n + x \).
   - It checks if \( y \) is even, which is necessary for the settling process to work.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and ensures that the result is unique by converting it to a set before counting.

5. **Validation**:
   - The logic in the main program matches the problem requirements.
   - The `func_1` function correctly identifies valid \( k \) values by finding divisors of the calculated \( q \).

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
