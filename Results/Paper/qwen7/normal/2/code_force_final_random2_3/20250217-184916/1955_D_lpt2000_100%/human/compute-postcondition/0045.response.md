Output State: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `in_aa` and `out_aa` are the next pair of elements from the slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`; `m` and `n` remain the same; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `E[out_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of `E[out_aa]` by 1. The other variables (`fnd`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, `m`, `n`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
