Postcondition: `out_aa` is the corresponding element from the slice `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0 and `E[out_aa]` is also greater than 0, then `out_aa` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.
