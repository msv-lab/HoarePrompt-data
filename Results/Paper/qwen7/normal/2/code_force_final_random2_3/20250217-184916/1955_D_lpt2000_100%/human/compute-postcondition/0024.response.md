Output State: **`aa` is a list such that `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least one element, and `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to -1.**

Explanation: The variable `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. Since the initial postcondition states that `D[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, after decrementing `E[out_aa]` by 1, `D[out_aa]` will be less than or equal to -1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
