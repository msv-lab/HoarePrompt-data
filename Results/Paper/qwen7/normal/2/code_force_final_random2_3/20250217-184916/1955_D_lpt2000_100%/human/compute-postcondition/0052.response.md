Postcondition: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. `in_aa` and `out_aa` are the next pair of elements from the slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]`, respectively, and `m` and `n` remain the same. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `C[in_aa] <= 0`, then `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1. Additionally, if `D[out_aa] > 0`, then `D[out_aa]` is increased by 1 and the expected value of `out_aa` is reduced by 1. If `D[out_aa] <= 0`, then `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.
