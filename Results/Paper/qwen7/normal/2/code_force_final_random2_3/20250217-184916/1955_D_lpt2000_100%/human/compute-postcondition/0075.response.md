Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `fnd` is 0, `D` is an empty list, `E` is an empty list, `C` is an empty list, `pairs_in_D` is 0, `in_aa` is undefined, `out_aa` is undefined, `bb` remains unchanged, `cnt_bb` remains unchanged, `aa` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input. It initializes the variables `fnd`, `D`, `E`, `C`, `pairs_in_D`, `in_aa`, and `out_aa`. At this point, `fnd` is set to 0 because no pairs have been checked yet, and the lists `D`, `E`, and `C` are empty. The variables `in_aa` and `out_aa` are undefined because they are only assigned values during the loop iterations. The values of `bb`, `cnt_bb`, and `aa` remain unchanged from their initial values, and `m` and `n` also remain unchanged.
