Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nabors` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `nabors` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                pairs_in_D -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            D[in_aa] += 1
            pairs_in_D += 1
            C[in_aa] -= 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, resulting in the final state of the variables as follows:

- `fnd` will be 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` after all iterations, otherwise `fnd` will be 0.
- `D`, `E`, `C`, and `pairs_in_D` will reflect the cumulative changes made throughout all iterations based on the conditions within the loop.
- The values of `in_aa` and `out_aa` will be the last pair of elements processed during the loop's final iteration.
- `m` and `n` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
- `bb` and `cnt_bb` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
- `aa` will remain unchanged from its initial value, but `in_aa` and `out_aa` will be the last pair of elements from the slices `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` respectively.

In summary, the output state captures the final configuration of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations, with `fnd` indicating whether the condition `pairs_in_D >= k` was met at any point during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: All variables retain their final values after the loop has executed all iterations as described by the given rules. Specifically, `fnd` is increased by 1 each time `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` during any iteration. The value of `pairs_in_D` is adjusted based on the conditions within the loop, and `C[in_aa]` and `D[in_aa]` are updated accordingly. `C[out_aa]` and `E[out_aa]` are also updated based on the conditions. After all iterations, `fnd` will be the total count of times `pairs_in_D` met or exceeded `k`, and the counters `C` and `D` will reflect the cumulative changes made during the loop executions.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:
- `fnd` is incremented by 1 every time `pairs_in_D` reaches or exceeds `k` during the loop's execution.
- `pairs_in_D` is updated based on the conditions within the loop.
- `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1 for each `in_aa` processed.
- `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1 for each `in_aa` processed when `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0.
- `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 for each `out_aa` processed when `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0 and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0.
- `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 for each `out_aa` processed regardless of the condition.
- `C[out_aa]` remains unchanged.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `bb`, `aa`, `cnt_aa`, and `cnt_bb` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: All variables will reach their final states based on the operations performed within the loop over all iterations.

In the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, the following conditions will hold true:

- The variable `fnd` will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is determined by the value of `n - m`.
- The variable `m` will be equal to `n`, as the loop increments `m` by 1 each iteration until it reaches `n`.
- The variable `pairs_in_D` will reflect the net result of all operations performed on `D` and `E` during the loop iterations, potentially increasing or decreasing based on the conditions met within the loop.
- The variable `D` will be updated based on the decrements and increments performed during the loop, with entries corresponding to `out_aa` being decreased by the number of times they were decremented and entries corresponding to `in_aa` being increased by the number of times they were incremented.
- The variable `E` will be updated based on the decrements performed during the loop, with entries corresponding to `out_aa` being decreased by the number of times they were decremented.
- The variable `C` will be updated based on the decrements performed during the loop, with entries corresponding to `in_aa` being decreased by the number of times they were decremented.
- The variable `fnd` will be set to 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` at the end of the loop, otherwise it will be 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
