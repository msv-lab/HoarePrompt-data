Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 to become `D[out_aa] - 1`, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `aa` is a list such that `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` each have at least one element.**

The code `pairs_in_D -= 1` decreases the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. Since `D[out_aa]` was initially decreased by 1, it is updated to `D[out_aa] - 1`. The conditions on `E[out_aa]` and the list `aa` remain unchanged.
