Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `D[out_aa] -= 1` decreases the value of the dictionary `D` at key `out_aa` by 1. The initial state of `out_aa` being the corresponding element from the slice `aa[:n - m]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that `D[out_aa]` is now one less than its previous value.
