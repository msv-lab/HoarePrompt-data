Output State: **`D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `nabors` is a list of strings converted from the input split by spaces, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `bb` is a list of strings converted from another input split by spaces, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in `bb`, `E` is a Counter object containing elements in `cnt_aa` but not in `D`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`.**

Explanation: The code `E = cnt_aa - D` creates a new Counter object `E` which contains the elements that are in `cnt_aa` but not in `D`. The other variables remain unchanged.
