Postcondition: **`fnd` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; `m` is less than `n` and `n - m` is greater than 1; `D[out_aa]` is either decreased by 1 or remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; if `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0; otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and either `E[out_aa]` is not decreased by 1 or `D[out_aa]` is not decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is not increased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**
