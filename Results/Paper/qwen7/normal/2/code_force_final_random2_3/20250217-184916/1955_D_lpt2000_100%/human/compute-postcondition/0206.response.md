Output State: **`fnd` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether `pairs_in_D` is now greater than or equal to `k`; `m` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`; `n - m` is greater than 1; `D[out_aa]` is now one less than its previous value; `E[out_aa]` is not decreased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 and is now equal to `C[out_aa] + 1`; `pairs_in_D` is either `pairs_in_D + 1` or decreased by 1; `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `C[out_aa] += 1` increments the value of `C[out_aa]` by 1. Since `C[out_aa]` was previously decreased by 1, it is now equal to `C[out_aa] + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
