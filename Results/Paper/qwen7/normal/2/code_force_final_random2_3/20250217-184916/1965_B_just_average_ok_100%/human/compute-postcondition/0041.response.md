Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range of `len(nums)`.

3. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either `idx + 1` where `idx` is `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `i` remains unchanged and we do not break out of the loop or if statement because `nums[i] <= k`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` was incremented (`i = idx + 1`), then `i` will be `idx + 2` in the next iteration.
   - If `i` remained unchanged (`nums[i] <= k`), then `i` will still be the same value as in the previous iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `i` can either increment by 1 or remain the same, we need to consider both cases. However, the key point is that `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration unless it was already at the end of the list.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is either `idx + 2` where `idx` is `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `i` remains unchanged and we do not break out of the loop or if statement because `nums[i] <= k`**.
