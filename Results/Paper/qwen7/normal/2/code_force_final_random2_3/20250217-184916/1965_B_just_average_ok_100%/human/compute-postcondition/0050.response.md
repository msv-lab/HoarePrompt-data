Output State: **`i` is 20, `idx` is 20, `nums` is a list with elements [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1048577, 1048578]**.

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `nums` list. The new element is calculated as `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Given that `k` is not defined in the provided code, it is assumed to be 0 (as it is not specified otherwise). Therefore, the new element added to the list is `0 + nums[20] + 1`, which is `0 + 1048577 + 1 = 1048578`. The values of `i` and `idx` remain unchanged.
