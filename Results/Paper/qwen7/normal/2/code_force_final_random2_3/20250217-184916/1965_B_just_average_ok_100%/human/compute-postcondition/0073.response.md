Output State: `i` is 21, `idx` is 19, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576].

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will still be 21 because the loop only increments `i` from 0 to the length of `nums` minus one, but since `nums[21]` (which is 1048576) is not checked against `k` in the given loop, it does not change. The variable `idx` is set to `i - 1` when `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, and since `nums[21]` is the last element and the loop breaks without finding an element greater than `k`, `idx` remains 19. All other variables (`k`, `n`, and `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
