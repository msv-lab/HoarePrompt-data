You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():

        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:

    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations will include `i` being 21, `idx` being 19, and `nums` being a list containing all powers of 2 from \(2\) up to \(1048576\), plus \(k-1048576\), \(k+1\), and \(k+1048576+1\), with the element \(1048576\) removed. The exact content of `nums` depends on the value of `k`, but it will always include the numbers \(2, 4, 8, \ldots, 1048576, k-1048576, k+1, k+1048576+1\), excluding \(1048576\).
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `nums` will contain all powers of 2 from \(2\) to \(1048576\) inclusive, along with three additional numbers derived from `k`: \(k-1048576\), \(k+1\), and \(k+1048576+1\), with the number \(1048576\) removed from the list.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It then reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\):
     ```python
     nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
     ```
   - This creates a list of integers: `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^20]`.

3. **Finding the Appropriate Index:**
   - The program iterates through `nums` to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`:
     ```python
     idx = -1
     for i in range(len(nums)):
         if nums[i] > k:
             idx = i - 1
             break
     ```
   - If `k` is less than or equal to \(2^{20}\), `idx` will be the index of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Adjusting the List:**
   - The program appends new values to `nums`:
     ```python
     nums.append(k - nums[idx])
     nums.append(k + 1)
     nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
     ```
   - It removes the element at the found index:
     ```python
     nums.remove(1 << idx)
     ```

5. **Output:**
   - The length of the modified `nums` list is printed.
   - The elements of `nums` are printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - The value `k - nums[idx]` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`. This is because `k - nums[idx]` is constructed to avoid any combination that could sum to `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
   - The values `k + 1`, `k + nums[idx] + 1`, and the remaining powers of 2 ensure that all values from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed as subsequences.
   - The construction guarantees that every integer from 1 to `n` can be represented as a sum of some subset of the modified `nums`.

3. **Sequence Size Constraint:**
   - The sequence size is at most 25, which is satisfied by the construction method.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly constructs a sequence that meets all the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
