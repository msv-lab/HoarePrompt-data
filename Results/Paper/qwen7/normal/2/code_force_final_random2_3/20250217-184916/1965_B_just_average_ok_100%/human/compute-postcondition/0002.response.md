Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is the first number entered by the user and `k` is the second number entered by the user, both converted to integers; `nums` is a list containing the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` using a list comprehension where each element is calculated as \(1\) left-shifted by \(i\), for \(i\) ranging from \(0\) to \(20\). This results in a list of powers of \(2\) starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{20}\). The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
