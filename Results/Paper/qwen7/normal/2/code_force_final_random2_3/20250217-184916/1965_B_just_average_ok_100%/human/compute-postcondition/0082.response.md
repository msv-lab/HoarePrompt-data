Output State: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations will include `i` being 21, `idx` being 19, and `nums` being a list containing all powers of 2 from \(2\) up to \(1048576\), plus \(k-1048576\), \(k+1\), and \(k+1048576+1\), with the element \(1048576\) removed. The exact content of `nums` depends on the value of `k`, but it will always include the numbers \(2, 4, 8, \ldots, 1048576, k-1048576, k+1, k+1048576+1\), excluding \(1048576\).

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `nums` will contain all powers of 2 from \(2\) to \(1048576\) inclusive, along with three additional numbers derived from `k`: \(k-1048576\), \(k+1\), and \(k+1048576+1\), with the number \(1048576\) removed from the list.
