Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is a placeholder typically used when the loop variable itself is not needed. However, the loop variable is effectively `int(input())`, which we will call `num_tests`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer. Given the constraints, `num_tests` (the number of test cases) must be a positive integer within the specified range.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: The initial state before the loop starts includes the value of `t` and the constraints on `n` and `k` for each test case. Since the loop will run based on the input from `int(input())`, the state needs to ensure that this input is valid.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input that will be read from `int(input())`. This input should be a positive integer within the specified range.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- The input from `int(input())` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{num_tests} \leq 1000\)

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the input from `int(input())` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{num_tests} \leq 1000\)**.
