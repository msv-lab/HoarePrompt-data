Output State: **`i` is 2, `idx` is 1, `nums` is a list with elements [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code replaces the existing `nums` list with a new list generated using a list comprehension. The new list contains elements that are powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). The values of `i`, `idx`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
