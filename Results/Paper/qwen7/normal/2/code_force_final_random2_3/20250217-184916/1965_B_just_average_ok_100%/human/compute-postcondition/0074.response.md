Output State: `i` is 21, `idx` is 19, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576].

Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will still be 21 because the loop only increments `i` and checks the condition in each iteration. The variable `idx` is set to `i - 1` when `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, but since `nums[21]` is not in the list (as the list only goes up to `nums[20]`), the loop will not increment `i` further and will exit without changing `idx` again. Therefore, `idx` remains 19. The values of `k`, `n`, and the `nums` list do not change throughout the loop iterations.
