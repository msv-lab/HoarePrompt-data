Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 19, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152].**

Explanation: The code appends `k - nums[idx]` to the `nums` list. Since `idx` is 19, the code calculates `k - nums[19]` and appends this value to `nums`. Given that `nums[19]` is 1048576, the new value appended to `nums` is `k - 1048576`. Therefore, the updated `nums` list is now `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152]`, where the last element is `k - 1048576`. All other variables remain unchanged.
