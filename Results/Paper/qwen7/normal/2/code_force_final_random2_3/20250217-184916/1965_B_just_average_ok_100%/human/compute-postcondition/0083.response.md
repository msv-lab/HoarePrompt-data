Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each t, two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) are provided. The function returns different values based on the conditions specified for n and k.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing values for t, n, and k. For each test case, it checks the values of n and k against specific conditions and returns a corresponding output based on those conditions.
