Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `i` is 20.
2. `idx` is also defined as 20.
3. `nums` is a list with specific elements, but it explicitly excludes 1048576. The list provided is [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1048577, 1048578].

To determine the length of the list `nums`, we need to count the number of elements in this list.

Counting the elements:
- 1
- 2
- 4
- 8
- 16
- 32
- 64
- 128
- 256
- 512
- 1024
- 2048
- 4096
- 8192
- 16384
- 32768
- 65536
- 131072
- 262144
- 524288
- 1048577
- 1048578

There are 22 elements in the list `nums`.

Therefore, the `print(len(nums))` statement will print the length of the list `nums`, which is 22.

Output: **22**
