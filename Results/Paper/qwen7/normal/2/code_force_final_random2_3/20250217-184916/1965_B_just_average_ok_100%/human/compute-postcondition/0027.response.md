Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 2.
   - `idx` is 1.
   - `nums` is a list with elements `[2, k + 1]`.

2. **Understanding the Code Snippet**:
   - The `print(*nums)` statement uses the unpacking operator `*` to print the elements of the list `nums` separated by spaces.

3. **Determining the Value of `k + 1`**:
   - Since `k + 1` is part of the list `nums`, but `k` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know it is an integer that results from adding 1 to `k`.

4. **Final List `nums`**:
   - Given the initial state, `nums` is `[2, k + 1]`.

5. **Output of the Print Statement**:
   - When `print(*nums)` is executed, it will print the elements of the list `nums` separated by spaces. Therefore, the output will be `2` followed by `k + 1`.

Output: **2 k+1**
