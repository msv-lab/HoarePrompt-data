Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 20, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since no such loop or if statement was specified in the code snippet, we assume it refers to the most internal one. All other variables retain their initial or updated states as given in the initial state description.
