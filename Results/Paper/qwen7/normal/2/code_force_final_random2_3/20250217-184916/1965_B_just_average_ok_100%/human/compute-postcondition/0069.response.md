Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 20, `k` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576], `idx` is updated to `i - 1` which is 20.**

In this case, the code updates `idx` to `i - 1`, which means `idx` is now 20. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
