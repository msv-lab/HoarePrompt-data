Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` is at least 5, `k` is decreased by (4 + 1) * (a[5] - a[4])**.

Explanation: The code `k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value. Here, `i` is 4, so the expression becomes `k -= (4 + 1) * (a[5] - a[4])`, which simplifies to `k -= 5 * (a[5] - a[4])`. The values of `i` and `n` are updated as described above, and the value of `k` is adjusted accordingly.
