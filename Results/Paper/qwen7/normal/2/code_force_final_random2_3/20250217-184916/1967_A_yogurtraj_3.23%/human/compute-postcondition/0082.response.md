Output State: **`i` is 5; `n` is greater than 6; `k` is decreased by (5 + 1) * (a[6] - a[5])** 

Explanation: The variable `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Given that `i` is 5, the expression simplifies to `(5 + 1) * (a[6] - a[5])`, which means `k` is decreased by `6 * (a[6] - a[5])`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
