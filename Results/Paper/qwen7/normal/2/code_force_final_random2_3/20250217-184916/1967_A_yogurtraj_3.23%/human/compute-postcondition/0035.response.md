Output State: **`i` is 2 - (a[3] - a[2]), `n` is greater than 1, `k` is updated by subtracting (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) from its current value, `r` is 0, `rem` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`. Since `i` was initially 2, the new value of `i` becomes `2 - (2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])`, which simplifies to `2 - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `r`, `rem`) are not affected by this operation, so they retain their initial or unchanged values.
