Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (since `n - 1` is the upper bound but `range` stops at `n - 2`).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1, and `n` is greater than 1.

3. **Update the values for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` is 0, the loop will continue as `i` will become 1.
   - If `i` is 1, the loop will stop because `i` will become 2, which is out of the range `0` to `n - 2`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop continues if `i` is 0, `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be updated to 1.
- `n` remains the same and is still greater than 1.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
