Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is updated based on the condition of `i`, `r` is either 0 or the second element of `a`, and `rem` is `k % 1`, `y` is `n - 1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `i` is 0, then `k` remains 0 and `r` is 0. If `i` is 1, then `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.
