Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is equal to `a[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`. The value of `i` is 2, so `r` is set to `a[3]`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
