Output State: **`i` is 5; `n` is greater than 6; `k` is decreased by (5 + 1) * (a[6] - a[5]); `r` is a[6]**.

Explanation: The code assigns `a[i + 1]` to `r`. Since `i` is 5, `i + 1` equals 6, so `r` is assigned the value of `a[6]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
