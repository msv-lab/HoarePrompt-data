Output State: **`i` is 9, `r` is `a[11]`, `k` is decreased by 10 * (`a[10]` - `a[9]`), `rem` is 0, and `y` is `n - 9`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `r = a[i + 1]` updates the value of `r` to be `a[10 + 1]`, which is `a[11]`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `rem`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
