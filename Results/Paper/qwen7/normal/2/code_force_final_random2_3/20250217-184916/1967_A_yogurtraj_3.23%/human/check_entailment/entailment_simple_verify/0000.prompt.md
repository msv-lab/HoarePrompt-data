You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations, meaning `ii` (which represents the index of the current test case) is equal to the total number of test cases. After the final iteration, the value of `r` is determined as follows: if `k` is not zero, then `r` is `a[n-1] + k // n`. Otherwise, `r` is simply `a[n-1]`. The variable `rem` is 0, and `y` is 0 since no further increments or conditions were met to change their values beyond the third iteration.
    #
    #In more detail:
    #- `ii` equals the total number of test cases.
    #- If `k` is not zero, then `r` is set to `a[n-1] + k // n`.
    #- If `k` is zero, then `r` is set to `a[n-1]`.
    #- `rem` remains 0.
    #- `y` remains 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for determining the maximum score is flawed. The program attempts to adjust the values of `a` to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`, but it does not correctly handle the distribution of the additional `k` cards to achieve this goal.

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3 4
6 1 8
```
- Expected Output: 22
- Program Output: 15

The program's logic does not properly account for the optimal way to distribute the additional `k` cards to maximize the score. In this case, the optimal solution involves buying 4 cards of type 1 to transform the array into `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8]`. This results in 22 subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of `[1, 2, 3]`.

The program fails to consider this optimal strategy, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
