Output State: **`i` is 5, `n` is greater than 7, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[5] + 0 // 6`, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no changes are made to the variables `i`, `n`, `k`, `r`, `rem`, and `y`, their values remain as they were in the initial state. The only indication of the action taken is the break statement itself.
