Output State: **`i` is 7, `r` is `a[8] + k // 8`, `rem` is `k % 9`**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, which is `9`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `7`, and the value of `r` remains unchanged as `a[8] + k // 8`. The new variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k % 9`.
