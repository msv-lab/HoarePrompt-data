Output State: **`i` is 7, `r` is `a[8]`, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to `r`. Since `i` is 7, `i + 1` is 8, so `r` is set to `a[8]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains valid.
