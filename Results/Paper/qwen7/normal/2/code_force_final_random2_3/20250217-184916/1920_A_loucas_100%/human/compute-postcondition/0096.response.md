Output State: **`num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `big` is a list containing the input integer `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the input integer `a` to the list `big`. Since `big` was not defined before, it is initialized as a list containing only the element `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
