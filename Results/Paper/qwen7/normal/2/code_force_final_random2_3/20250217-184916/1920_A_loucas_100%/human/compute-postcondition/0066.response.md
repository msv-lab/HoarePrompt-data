Output State: **`num` is 0, `innerLoop` is 0, `iterable2` is -1, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` is empty.**

The code `big = []` initializes `big` as an empty list. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`num`, `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `less`, and `no`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
