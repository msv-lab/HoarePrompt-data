Output State: **`loop` must be an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive; `iterable` is 0; `less` is an empty list; `big` is an empty list; `no` is an empty list.**

The code `no = []` creates an empty list and assigns it to the variable `no`. This does not affect the values of `loop`, `iterable`, `less`, or `big`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
