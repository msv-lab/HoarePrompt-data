Output State: **`num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer different from 1, `a` is an input integer, and `less` is a list containing the value of `a`.**

The code appends the value of `a` to the list `less`. Since `a` is an input integer, the list `less` now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged.
