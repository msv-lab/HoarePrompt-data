Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `no`, `big`, and `less` lists will contain all the integers `a` that were input during the loop's iterations; specifically, if `x` was 1, the integer `a` will be added to the `big` list; if `x` was 2, the integer `a` will be added to the `less` list; otherwise, the integer `a` will be added to the `no` list; the variable `num` is 0; the variable `innerLoop` retains its initial value, which is the number of times the loop was intended to run; after all iterations, `iterable2` equals `innerLoop - 1`, reflecting the total number of times the loop body was executed; the loop continues to the next iteration if `num < 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is an integer such that it is less than or equal to the minimum value in the list `less` and one less than the maximum value in the list `big`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an integer such that `i <= min_less` and `i + 1 < max_big`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `num` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is an integer such that `i + 1 <= min_less` and `i + 2 < max_big`, and `no` remains unchanged. If `i` is less than or equal to `min(less)` and greater than or equal to `max(big)`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made as well.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
