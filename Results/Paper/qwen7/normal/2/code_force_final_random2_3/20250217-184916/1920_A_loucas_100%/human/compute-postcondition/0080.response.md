Output State: **`num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer different from 2, `a` is appended to the list `no`.**

The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`, but since `no` was not defined before, it will be created as a list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
