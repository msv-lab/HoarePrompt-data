Postcondition: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0; `iterable2` will be equal to `innerLoop - 1`; `big` will contain all the integers `a` for which `x` was 1 during the iterations; `less` will contain all the integers `a` for which `x` was 2 during the iterations; `no` will contain all the integers `a` for which `x` was neither 1 nor 2 during the iterations; `num` is equal to `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, and if `num` is less than 1, the loop continues.**
