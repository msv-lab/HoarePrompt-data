Postcondition: **`num` is 0, `innerLoop` is equal to or greater than 3, `iterable2` is 2, `big` is a list that may contain integers based on user inputs where `x == 1`, `less` is a list that may contain integers based on user inputs where `x == 2` and `a` is not already in `less`, `no` is a list that contains integers based on user inputs where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, and `num` remains unchanged as it is always 0 since the condition `num < 1` is never met.**
