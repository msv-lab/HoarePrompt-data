Postcondition: **The `no`, `big`, and `less` lists will contain all the integers `a` that were input during the loop's iterations; specifically, if `x` was 1, the integer `a` will be added to the `big` list; if `x` was 2, the integer `a` will be added to the `less` list; otherwise, the integer `a` will be added to the `no` list; the variable `num` is 0; the variable `innerLoop` retains its initial value, which is the number of times the loop was intended to run; after all iterations, `iterable2` equals `innerLoop - 1`, reflecting the total number of times the loop body was executed; the loop continues to the next iteration if `num < 1`.**
