Output State: **`no` contains at least one integer, `i` is the next integer in the `no` list, and either `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, or `i` remains unchanged from its original value in the `no` list; `num` is `num - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `num` is decremented by 1, but the specific value of `num` is not given, so we express it as `num - 1`. The conditions for `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
