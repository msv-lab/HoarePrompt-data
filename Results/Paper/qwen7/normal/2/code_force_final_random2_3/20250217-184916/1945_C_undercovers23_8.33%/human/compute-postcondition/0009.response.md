Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`.**

The code assigns the value of `n // 2` to `pk`. Since `n` is an odd number, `n // 2` results in an integer division, which truncates the decimal part. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
