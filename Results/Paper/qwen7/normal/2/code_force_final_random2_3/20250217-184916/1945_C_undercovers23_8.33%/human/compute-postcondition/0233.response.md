Postcondition: `lst` must contain at least one element, `mini` will be updated during the loop, and `final` will contain the next element in the list `elem`, where `mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` will be set to `elem`.
