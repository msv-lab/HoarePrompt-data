Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(n // 2 - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(n // 2 - elem)` value, and `final` is sorted, `c1` is the same as the previous value, `n` is now `n // 2`, and `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `pk` is assigned the value of `n // 2`, which means `pk` is now half of `n` (integer division). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
