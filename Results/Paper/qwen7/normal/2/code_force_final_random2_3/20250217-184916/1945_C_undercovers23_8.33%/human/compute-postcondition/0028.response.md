Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0, and zero percentage is greater than or equal to 50 and one percentage is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `i + 1` equals 1. This value is appended to `lst`, but since no list was mentioned in the initial state, we assume `lst` is being updated here. However, the question asks for the state of the variables, not the list itself. The value of `i` is updated to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding percentages also remain valid as they are not affected by the code.
