Postcondition: `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` is an empty list with an additional element 0, contains all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, and `final` is sorted. Otherwise, `final` is a list containing `n` and `c1` is less than 50, and `final` is sorted.
