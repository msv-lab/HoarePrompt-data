Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, `one_perc` is 0, `zero_perc` is 50; `lst` is [3]**.

The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `i + 1` equals 3. Therefore, `lst` becomes `[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
