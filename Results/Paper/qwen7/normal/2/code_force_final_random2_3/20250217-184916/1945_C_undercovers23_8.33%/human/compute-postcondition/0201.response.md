Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `n // 2`, `zero` is 1, `one` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50.0, `one_perc` is 100, `lst` contains `[2]`**

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `i + 1` equals 2. Since no other variables are affected, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, `lst` now contains the element 2.
