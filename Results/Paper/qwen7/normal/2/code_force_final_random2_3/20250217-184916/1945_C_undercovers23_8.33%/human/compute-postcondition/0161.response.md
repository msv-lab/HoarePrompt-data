Output State: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, `final` is a list containing 0 and sorted elements from `lst` such that the absolute difference between `pk` and each element is equal to `mini`, `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` and is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `final`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `c1` is still greater than or equal to 50 as per the initial state.
