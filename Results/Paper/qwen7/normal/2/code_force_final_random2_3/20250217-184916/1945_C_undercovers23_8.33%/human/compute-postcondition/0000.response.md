Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and the value of `t` is within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. The other conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state (such as `n` and `a`) are not affected by this line of code.
