Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in the list `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`**.

The code `z = sl.count('0')` calculates the number of '0's in the list `sl` and assigns it to the variable `z`. The other variables remain unchanged.
