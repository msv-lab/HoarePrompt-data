Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the percentage of satisfied residents on each side of the road. Specifically, the program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using `100` as a divisor, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should use the actual counts of zeros and ones, respectively, to ensure the percentages are accurate.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
010111
```
The program incorrectly calculates the percentages, leading to the wrong position being chosen. The correct approach should be to directly compare the counts of zeros and ones without using percentages.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = pow(10, 8)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                lst.append(i + 1)
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(n // 2 - ele))
        final = []
        for elem in lst:
            if abs(n // 2 - elem) == mini:
                final.append(elem)
        final.sort()
        if len(final) == 0:
            if o >= n // 2:
                final.append(0)
            else:
                final.append(n)
        print(final[0])
```

This corrected version ensures that the conditions for satisfaction are checked correctly and the position of the road is determined accurately.
