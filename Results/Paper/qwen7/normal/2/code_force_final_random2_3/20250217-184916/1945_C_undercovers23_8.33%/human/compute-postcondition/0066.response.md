Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` now contains the first element of `lst` followed by `elem`, and `elem` is the second element of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Initially, `final` contained only the first element of `lst`. After appending `elem`, `final` now contains the first element of `lst` followed by `elem`. The value of `elem` remains the same as it was before the operation. The value of `mini` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
