Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, `one_perc` is 50, `zero_perc` is 50; `one_perc` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The initial values are: `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `zero` is 2, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 0, `zero_perc` is 50.
- The code updates `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- Substituting the known values: `o` is `one`, which is 0; `one` is 0; `n` is at least 3; `i` is 2.
- The calculation becomes `math.ceil((0 - 0) * 100 / (n - 2 - 1))`, which simplifies to `math.ceil(0 * 100 / (n - 3))`.
- Since the numerator is 0, the result of the division is 0, and `math.ceil(0)` is 0.
- Therefore, `one_perc` is updated to 0.

All other variables remain unchanged.
