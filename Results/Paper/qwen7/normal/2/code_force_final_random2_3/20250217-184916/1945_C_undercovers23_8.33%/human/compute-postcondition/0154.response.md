Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, and `final` is a list containing the element `elem` and an additional element `elem`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` will contain two occurrences of `elem`.
