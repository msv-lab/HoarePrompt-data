Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between its previous value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in the list `lst` and `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`**.

This means that the value of `mini` has been updated to be the smaller of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. The value of `ele` remains unchanged as it is the next element in the list `lst`, and no other variables are affected.
