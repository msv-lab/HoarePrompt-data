Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `zero` is 1, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is 100, `one_perc` is 0**

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Given the initial state where `o` (which is the same as `zero`) is 1, `one` is 0, `n` is at least 1, and `i` is 0, the calculation becomes `math.ceil((1 - 0) * 100 / (n - 0 - 1)) = math.ceil(100 / (n - 1))`. Since `n` must be at least 1, the smallest possible value for `n - 1` is 0, which would make the division undefined. However, since `n` cannot be 1 (as it would make the denominator zero), the smallest valid value for `n` is 2. For `n = 2`, the expression evaluates to `math.ceil(100 / 1) = 100`. For any larger value of `n`, the value of `one_perc` will be less than 100 but will be rounded up to the nearest integer. Given the smallest valid `n` is 2, the value of `one_perc` is 0 when considering the initial conditions and the ceiling function.
