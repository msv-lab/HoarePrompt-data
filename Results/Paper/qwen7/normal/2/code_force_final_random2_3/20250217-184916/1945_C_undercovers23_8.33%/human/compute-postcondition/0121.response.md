Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `n` is at least 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `one` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[i] != '0'` is met, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, and if `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are both greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains `[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The given code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. However, the values of `o`, `one`, `n`, `i`, and `lst` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `one_perc`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, the output state includes the updated calculation for `one_perc` and retains the other variables in their initial conditions with the additional information about the calculation performed.
