Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for elem in lst:`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`.
   - `final` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst`, assigning each element to `elem` one by one.
   - The loop will execute as long as `lst` contains elements.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each element in `lst`, the list `lst` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `elem` will take on the value of each element in `lst` during each iteration, but its initial state is not relevant to the loop's execution condition.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of the list `lst`. Specifically, `lst` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`mini` is the minimum difference between `pk` and any element in the list `lst`, `final` is an empty list, `lst` must contain at least one element**.
