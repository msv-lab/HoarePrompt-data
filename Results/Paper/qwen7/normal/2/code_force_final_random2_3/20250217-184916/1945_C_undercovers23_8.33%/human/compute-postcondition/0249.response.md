Postcondition: `final` is a list that either contains all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, and is sorted, or it is an empty list with an additional element 0, depending on whether `c1` (which is `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` remains sorted and contains `n`.
