Output State: `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. `final` now contains all elements from `lst` for which `abs(pk - elem)` equals `mini`, and `elem` is the last element of `lst`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `mini` will still hold the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. The list `final` will contain every element from `lst` that has the same absolute difference with `pk` as the value of `mini`. Additionally, `elem` will be the last element of `lst` that was processed in the loop.
