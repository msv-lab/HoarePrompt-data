Output State: **`mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`. `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(pk - elem)` value, and `elem` is the last element of `lst`; `final` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. Since `final` contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest difference with `pk`, sorting `final` does not change the fact that these elements have the smallest difference. The value of `mini` remains the same, and `elem` is still the last element of `lst`. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged `mini`, `final`, and `elem`, along with the new state that `final` is now sorted.
