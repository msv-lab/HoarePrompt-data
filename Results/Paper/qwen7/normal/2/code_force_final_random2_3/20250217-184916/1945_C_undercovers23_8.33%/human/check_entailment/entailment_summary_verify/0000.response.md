### Reasoning:

The original assessment was accurate. The provided code indeed has issues with calculating the percentages of satisfied residents on each side of the road. The original assessment correctly pointed out that the program uses `100` as a divisor when calculating `zero_perc` and `one_perc`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should directly compare the counts of zeros and ones to determine if they meet the required threshold.

Let's analyze the corrected version of the code provided in the original assessment:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        (zero, one) = (0, 0)
        lst = []
        mini = pow(10, 8)
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2) and one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2):
                lst.append(i + 1)
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(n // 2 - ele))
        final = []
        for elem in lst:
            if abs(n // 2 - elem) == mini:
                final.append(elem)
        final.sort()
        if len(final) == 0:
            if o >= n // 2:
                final.append(0)
            else:
                final.append(n)
        print(final[0])
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Counting Zeros and Ones**: The code correctly counts the number of zeros (`z`) and ones (`o`) in the input string.
2. **Iterating Through the String**: The loop iterates through the string from the beginning to the second-to-last character, updating the counts of zeros and ones.
3. **Checking Conditions**: The conditions `zero >= math.ceil((i + 1) / 2)` and `one >= math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2)` correctly check if the number of zeros and ones on each side meets the required threshold.
4. **Finding the Optimal Position**: The code finds the position `i` that minimizes the distance to the middle of the string while satisfying the conditions.
5. **Handling Edge Cases**: The edge cases where no valid position is found are handled correctly by appending either `0` or `n` to the result list.

Given the corrections and the analysis, the program now correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
