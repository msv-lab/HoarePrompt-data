Postcondition: `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(n // 2 - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`, `final` now contains all elements of `lst` that have the smallest `abs(n // 2 - elem)` value, and `final` is sorted, `c1` is the same as the previous value, `n` is now `n // 2`, and `t` is decreased by 1.
