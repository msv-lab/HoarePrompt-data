Output State: `mini` contains the smallest value among all `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., for every element in `lst`), `mini` will hold the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. This is because the loop continuously updates `mini` to be the smallest value it has encountered so far, which is the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)` for each iteration.
