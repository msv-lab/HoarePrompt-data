Postcondition: `i` is 0, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[i]` is either '0' or '1', and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]` if `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `s`. If `flag` is 1, then `s[i]` is '0'. If `flag` is 0, then `s[i]` is either '0' or '1' and is equal to `s[i + 1]` if `i + 1` is within the bounds of the string `s`.
