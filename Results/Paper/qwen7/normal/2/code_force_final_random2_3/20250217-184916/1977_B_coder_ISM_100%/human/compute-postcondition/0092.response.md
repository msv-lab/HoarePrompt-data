Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `length`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < length`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `length` is 30.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - `length` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `length` is still 30.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30**
