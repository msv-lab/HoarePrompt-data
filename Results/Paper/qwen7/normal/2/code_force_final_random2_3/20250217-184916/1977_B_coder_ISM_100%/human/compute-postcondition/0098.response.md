Output State: **`i` is 3; `length` is 30; `s[3]` is '0'**

The code `s[i] = '0'` updates the element at index `i` in the list `s` to `'0'`. Given that `i` is 3, the third element in the list `s` (considering the index starts from 0) is now `'0'`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the length of the list `s` also remains unchanged at 30.
