Output State: **`i` is 28, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[28]` is '0', `s[29]` is '0', `s[30]` is '1'**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since the initial length of `s` is 30 (considering indices from 0 to 29), appending `'1'` increases the length of `s` to 31, making the new index 30. The values of `i`, `flag`, `s[28]`, and `s[29]` remain unchanged.
