Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `nalla` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of length 32 where the last element is either '1' or '0' based on whether `x & pow(2, i)` is true or false, and the 2nd element of `s` is updated accordingly, and `s` has an additional '0' appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('0')` appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Since `s` originally had a length of 31, after appending `'0'`, its length becomes 32. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
