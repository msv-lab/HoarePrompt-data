Output State: **`i` is 28, `flag` is 1, the character at index 0 of string `s` is '1', and the characters at indices 1 through 28 of string `s` are '-1', and the character at index 29 of string `s` is '0'.**

The code `s[29] = '0'` changes the character at index 29 of string `s` from its original value (which was not '0') to '0'. All other variables remain unchanged.
