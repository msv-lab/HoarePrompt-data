Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate a valid array according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). This constraint is crucial but not enforced by the current implementation.

Consider the input \(x = 14\). The correct output should be \([0, -1, 0, 0, 1]\), but the program generates \([0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1]\) instead. This is because the program does not properly handle the transition from \(1\) to \(-1\) without setting the previous element to \(0\).

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: \(x = 14\)
- Expected Output: \([0, -1, 0, 0, 1]\)
- Program Output: \([0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1]\)

This shows that the program fails to meet the requirement of ensuring no consecutive non-zero elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
