Output State: **`i` is 0; `flag` is either true or false; the character at index 0 of string `s` is '-1'; the character at index 1 of string `s` is '1'.**

The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the character at index 0 of string `s` from '1' to '-1'. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
