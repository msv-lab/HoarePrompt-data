Output State: **`i` is 0, `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is '-1', `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`.**

The code changes the value of `s[i]` from '1' to '-1'. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `s[i]` was previously equal to `s[i + 1]`, and `i` is 0, it implies that `s[0]` was equal to `s[1]`. After the assignment, `s[0]` is now '-1', so `s[0]` is still equal to `s[1]` because both are '-1'.
