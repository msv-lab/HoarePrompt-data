Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i`.

2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `0` to `29`, inclusive.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is within the range [0, 29].
   - `length` is 30.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is set to 1, then the list `s` contains '1'. Otherwise, the list `s` contains '0'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `29`, at the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Given that `i` was within the range [0, 29] in the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be within the range [1, 30).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`, so if `i` was 29 before, it will be 0 in the next iteration (since the range wraps around).
   - `length` remains unchanged at 30.
   - The condition for the list `s` still holds based on the bit value of `x` at the new `i`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, and if the `i`-th bit of `x` is set to 1, then the list `s` contains '1'. Otherwise, the list `s` contains '0'**.
