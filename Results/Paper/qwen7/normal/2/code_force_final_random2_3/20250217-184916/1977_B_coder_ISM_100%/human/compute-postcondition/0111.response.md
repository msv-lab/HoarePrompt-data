Output State: **`nalla` is 30, `t` must be greater than 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list containing '1' at index 0, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially an empty list with a length of 30, after appending `'1'`, `s` now contains `'1'` at index 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
