Output State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, and `s` contains '1' at index 0.**

The code `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Given the initial state where `s` contains `'0'` at index 0 (since the i-th bit of `x` is not specified to be 1 initially), after executing the code, `s` will contain `'1'` at index 0. The values of `i` and `length` remain unchanged.
