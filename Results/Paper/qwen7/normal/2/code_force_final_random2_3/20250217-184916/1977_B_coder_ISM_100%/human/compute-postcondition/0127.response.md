Output State: `nalla` is 30, `t` must be greater than 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with length 30, and each element in `s` is either '1' or '0' based on whether the corresponding bit (from 0 to 29) of `x` is set or not.

This means that after the loop completes all 30 iterations, the list `s` will contain 30 elements, where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`. The index of each element in `s` (ranging from 0 to 29) matches the position of the bit in `x` (counting from the least significant bit). If the bit at position `i` in `x` is set (i.e., it is 1), then `s[i]` will be '1'. Otherwise, if the bit is not set (i.e., it is 0), then `s[i]` will be '0'.
