You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    24
    
    15
    
    27

Output

    1

    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: Output State: After all iterations, `i` is 30, `length` is exactly 31, the character at index 29 of string `s` is '0', and the character at index 30 of string `s` is '1'. The value of `flag` is 0. The string `s` has been fully processed according to the loop's rules, and no further modifications can be made, ensuring that every possible transformation based on the given conditions has been applied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) and another positive integer \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) < 2^30). For each test case, it converts \( x \) into a 30-bit binary representation, modifies this binary representation according to specific rules, and then prints the length of the modified binary string along with the string itself. The final state ensures that the string has been fully processed, and no further modifications can be made based on the given conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `s` to store the binary representation of `x`.
   - It iterates over the bits from `0` to `29` (since \(2^{30}\) is the upper limit).
   - If the bit at position `i` in `x` is set (`x & pow(2, i)`), it appends `'1'` to `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting the Binary Representation:**
   - The program then iterates over the bits from `0` to `28` to ensure no two consecutive non-zero bits exist.
   - If a non-zero bit is found after a zero bit (`flag` is set to `1`), it changes the current bit to `'0'` and sets the previous bit to `'-'`.
   - If a non-zero bit is found consecutively, it changes the current bit to `'0'`.
   - After processing, if the last bit is zero and `flag` is still set, it adjusts the last bit and possibly adds a new bit.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the adjusted array.
   - It then prints the array `s`.

### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Constraints:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraint \(1 \le n \le 32\) by ensuring the length of the array is within this range.
   - The values in the array are either `1`, `0`, or `-1`.

2. **Summation Condition:**
   - The program constructs the array such that the sum of the elements multiplied by their respective powers of 2 equals `x`.

3. **No Consecutive Non-Zero Bits:**
   - The program ensures that no two consecutive non-zero bits exist in the array, which satisfies the problem's requirement.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's verify with the example provided in the problem statement:

- For `x = 14`:
  - Binary representation: `1110`
  - Adjusted array: `[0, -1, 0, 0, 1]` (since `-1` is used instead of `1` when necessary to avoid consecutive non-zero bits).

- For `x = 15`:
  - Binary representation: `1111`
  - Adjusted array: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`

- For `x = 27`:
  - Binary representation: `11011`
  - Adjusted array: `[0, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1]`

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to generate an array that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the given program is correct.
