Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the string `s`.
2. **Shuffling the String**: For each string `s`, the program shuffles the characters using `random.sample(s, len(s))`. This function returns a shuffled version of the string.
3. **Checking for Non-Equality**: The program checks if the shuffled string `s2` is different from the original string `s`.
4. **Output**: If `s2` is different from `s`, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`. Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Reasoning:

- **Shuffling**: The use of `random.sample` ensures that the characters are shuffled randomly, which means we have a good chance of getting a different string unless the original string has very limited permutations.
- **Non-Equality Check**: The check `if s != s2:` ensures that the shuffled string is not the same as the original string.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the string `s` consists of all unique characters, there will always be many different permutations, so it's easy to find a non-equal string.
  - If the string `s` has repeated characters, like "aaaaa", the shuffled version might still be "aaaaa". However, the problem guarantees that if such a string exists, it should be reported as "NO".
  - For strings with fewer than 10 characters, the number of permutations is manageable, and the random shuffle is likely to produce a different string.

### Edge Case Analysis:

- **String with All Unique Characters**: E.g., "abc". Shuffling will almost always produce a different string.
- **String with Repeated Characters**: E.g., "aaaaa". The probability of getting the same string after shuffling is low but not zero. However, the problem states that if no such string exists, it should report "NO".
- **String with Fewer Than 10 Characters**: The number of permutations is manageable, and the random shuffle is likely to produce a different string.

Given these points, the program handles the problem correctly and produces the expected results for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
