Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses random sampling to generate a new string `s2` that is a rearrangement of the input string `s`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the generated string `s2` will always be different from the original string `s`. In some cases, especially with small strings, the random sampling might result in the same string being generated, leading to an incorrect output of "Yes" followed by the same string `s`.

For example, consider the input string "aaa":
- The program might randomly sample the string and generate "aaa" again, resulting in the output:
  ```
  Yes
  aaa
  ```

This output is incorrect because the generated string `s2` should be different from `s`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement for every potential case, making it incorrect.
