Correctness: **True**

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by generating a random permutation of the input string `s` using `random.sample`. If the generated string `s2` is different from `s`, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`. If they are the same, it prints "No". This approach works for the given constraints and examples, as long as there exists at least one permutation of `s` that is different from `s` itself. Given that `s` has a maximum length of 10, which is small enough to have permutations, and the problem guarantees that such a permutation exists unless the string consists of all identical characters (like "aaaaa"), the program correctly handles all cases as per the problem statement.
