Output State: **`left` is 1, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - left + 1`, `right` is 0, and the length of `s` must be at least 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the `cost` by adding the value of `right - left + 1`. Given the initial state, `left` is 1 and `right` is 0. Therefore, `cost` is updated to `0 - 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `0`. The other variables (`s`, `i`, and `right`) remain unchanged.
