Postcondition: `left` is 5, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is `right - 4`, `right` is greater than 5, the length of `s` must be at least 2, `s[1]` must not be '1', `s[4]` must not be '1', and no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0'; if `s[left]` is '1' and `s[right]` is '0', then the values of `s[left]` and `s[right]` have swapped.
