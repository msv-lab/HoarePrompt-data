Postcondition: `left` is 11, `s[6]` is not '1', and `len(s)` is at least 9. If `s[right]` is '0' and `s[left]` is '1', then `cost` is `right` - 11 + 1, and `s[right]` is swapped with `s[left]`. If the condition `s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1'` is not met, the values of `left`, `s[6]`, and `len(s)` remain unchanged.
