Output State: **`left` is 11, `s[6]` is not '1', `len(s)` is at least 9, `right` is at least 8, and `s[right + 2]` must not be '0'**.

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Since `right` was initially at least 7, after the increment, `right` is at least 8. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
