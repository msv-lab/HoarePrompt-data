Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2, `s` is a list containing two elements where the second element is the integer value of the second character of the original `sChar`.**

Explanation: The code `s.append(i)` appends the integer value of the first character of `sChar` to the list `s`. Since `s` initially contains the integer value of the first character of `sChar`, after appending `i` (which is the integer value of the first character), `s` will contain two elements: the integer value of the first character and the integer value of the second character of `sChar`. The length of `sChar` remains unchanged, and it is still a binary string with a length of at least 2.
