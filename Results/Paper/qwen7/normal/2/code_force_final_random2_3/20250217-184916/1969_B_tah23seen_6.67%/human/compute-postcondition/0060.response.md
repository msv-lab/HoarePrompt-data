Output State: **`left` is 11, `s[6]` is not '1', `len(s)` is at least 9, `right` is `right` + 1**

Explanation: The variable `right` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state of `right` was a value less than `len(s)`, and `len(s)` is at least 9, `right` now holds the value of its original value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
