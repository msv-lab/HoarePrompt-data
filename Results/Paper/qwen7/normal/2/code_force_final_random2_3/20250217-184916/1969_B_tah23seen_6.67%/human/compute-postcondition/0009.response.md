Output State: **`left` is 0, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, and `i` is the last character in `sChar`; `cost` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cost` to 0. This does not affect the values of `left`, `s`, or `i`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of these variables while adding the new value of `cost`.
