Output State: **`left` is 11, `cost` is `right` - 11 + 1, `s[6]` is not '1', `s[right]` is swapped with `s[left]`**

Explanation: The code `cost += right - left + 1` updates the value of `cost` by adding `right - left + 1` to its current value. Given that `left` is initially 11, `cost` will now be the initial value of `cost` plus `right - 11 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
