To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop continues as long as both conditions are true:
1. `left < len(s)`
2. `s[left] != '1'`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `left` is 8
- `s[7]` is not '1'
- `len(s)` is at least 9
- `right` is equal to `len(s)` and `s[right]` is '0'

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must still be true at the start of the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `left < len(s)`**
   - Currently, `left` is 8.
   - `len(s)` is at least 9.
   - For the loop to continue, `left` must remain less than `len(s)`.
   - Since `left` is 8 and `len(s)` is at least 9, this condition is already satisfied and does not need adjustment.

2. **Condition 2: `s[left] != '1'`**
   - Currently, `s[7]` is not '1'.
   - In the next iteration, `left` will be incremented from 8 to 9.
   - We need to ensure that `s[9] != '1'` for the loop to continue.
   - The current state does not provide information about `s[9]`, but since the loop has not yet terminated, it implies that `s[9]` is not '1'.

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are necessary for the loop to continue because both conditions are already satisfied based on the given state.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`left` is 8, `s[7]` is not '1', `len(s)` is at least 9, `right` is equal to `len(s)` and `s[right]` is '0'**
