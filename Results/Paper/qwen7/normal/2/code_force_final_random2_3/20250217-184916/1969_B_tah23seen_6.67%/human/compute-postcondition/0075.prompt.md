Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `left` is 0, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1
Code of the loop:
while left <= right and right < len(s) and left < len(s):
    if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
        s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
        cost += right - left + 1
    while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
        right += 1
    while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
        left += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `left` is 5, `s` is a list containing all the integer values of each character in `sChar`, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `cost` is 1, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, the length of `s` must be at least 2, `s[1]` must not be '1', `s[4]` must not be '1', and no character in `s` from index `right` onwards is '0'.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `left` will be equal to the length of `s` (which is 5 based on the information given), because the loop increments `left` until it reaches the end of the string or encounters a '1'. Since the loop stops when `left` equals the length of `s` and there are no '0's from index `right` onwards, the final value of `cost` will be `right - left + 1`, which is `5 - 5 + 1 = 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their final state after the third iteration.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `left` is 10, `s[6]` is not '1', and `len(s)` must be at least 9.

Explanation: Given the loop continues as long as `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`, and considering the state after 3 iterations where `left` is 9, the loop will continue to increment `left` until it either reaches the end of the list `s` or encounters a '1'. Since the length of `s` must be at least 9 based on the output state after 3 iterations, and assuming `s[9]` is not '1' (as it would terminate the loop if it were), `left` will be incremented to 10. The conditions for `s[6]` not being '1' and the length of `s` being at least 9 remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `left` is 11, `s[7]` is not '1', `len(s)` is at least 9, `right` is equal to `len(s)` and `s[right]` is '0'.

Explanation: Since the loop continues to increment `left` as long as `s[left]` is not '1' and `left` is less than `len(s)`, and given that `s[right]` is '0' and `right` equals `len(s)` at the end of the loop, we can deduce that the loop will continue until `left` reaches `len(s)` or `s[left]` becomes '1'. However, since `s[right]` is '0' and `right` is the length of the string, it means the loop will terminate just before it tries to access an index out of bounds, which implies that `s[left]` must eventually become '1' or `left` must reach `len(s)`. Given the initial state and the progression, `left` will be incremented to 11 before the loop terminates, making the final state `left` is 11, while `s[7]` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop. The other conditions (`len(s)` being at least 9 and `s[right]` being '0') remain true as well.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
