### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
The problem requires determining the year in which all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially, based on their periodicities. Each sign occurs every \( a_i \) years, and the next sign can only occur strictly after the previous one.

#### Provided Code:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function takes a string `path` consisting of characters '@' and '*', and computes the maximum sum of consecutive '@' characters, considering the constraints given by '*' characters.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case, storing and printing the results.

#### Analysis of Function 1:
- The function `func_1` does not relate to the problem at hand. It is designed to handle a different problem involving paths with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the periodicity of signs.
- The logic inside `func_1` does not compute the year in which all signs will occur based on their periodicities.

#### Analysis of Function 2:
- The function `func_2` reads input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.
- Since `func_1` is not solving the intended problem, `func_2` is also not solving the intended problem.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to find the year in which all signs will occur based on their periodicities. Instead, they are solving a different problem involving paths with '@' and '*' characters.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
