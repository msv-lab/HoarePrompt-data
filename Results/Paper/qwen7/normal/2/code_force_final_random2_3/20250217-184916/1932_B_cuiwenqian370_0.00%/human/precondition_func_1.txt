t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs for each test case. path is a string containing n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case.
