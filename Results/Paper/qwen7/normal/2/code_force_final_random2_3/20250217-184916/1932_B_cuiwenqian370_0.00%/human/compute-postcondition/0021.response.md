Output State: **`index` is 8, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 2, `n` is the sixth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the seventh element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 7, so now it is 8. The values of `t`, `n`, `path`, and `results` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
