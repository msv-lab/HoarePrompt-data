The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`. `path` is a string consisting of characters '@' and '*', where the length of the string is at least 1. The function returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, the function returns the maximum value among the elements in the `dp` list that are greater than negative infinity. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `path` and return either 0 or the maximum value from the `dp` list based on the conditions specified.
