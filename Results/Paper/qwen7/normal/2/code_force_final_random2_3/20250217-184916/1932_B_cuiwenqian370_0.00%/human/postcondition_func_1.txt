The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a number of signs with specific periodicities. It reads input from stdin, extracts the necessary data for each test case, calls another function `func_1` to process the periodicities, and stores the results. Finally, it prints the results for each test case. The function does not return any value.
