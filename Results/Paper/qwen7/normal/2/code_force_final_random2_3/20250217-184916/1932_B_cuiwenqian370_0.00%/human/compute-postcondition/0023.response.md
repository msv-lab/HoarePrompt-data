Output State: `index` is 10, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 3, `n` is the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` now contains the return value of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous contents.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `index` will be 10 (since it increments by 2 with each iteration and there are 5 iterations in total), `t` will be the initial value of `t` minus 3, `n` will be the eighth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` will be the ninth element of `data` converted to an integer, and `results` will contain the accumulated results from calling `func_1(path)` for each iteration.
