### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires calculating the year when all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially, given their periodicities \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).
   - The solution should involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of these periodicities, as the LCM will give the smallest year when all signs will occur together.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function processes a string consisting of characters '@' and '*', which is unrelated to the problem of finding the year when all signs will occur. It uses dynamic programming to find the maximum number of valid states, which is irrelevant to the problem.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads input and calls `func_1` on each test case. Since `func_1` is not solving the intended problem, `func_2` is also not solving the intended problem.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state transitions in `func_1`, but these transitions are for a different problem. The annotations do not align with the problem requirements.
   - The `func_2` function correctly reads input and calls `func_1`, but since `func_1` is not solving the intended problem, the overall program is still incorrect.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that both functions are not implementing the logic required to solve the problem, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided code does not implement the logic needed to solve the problem of finding the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem and do not address the required calculations.
