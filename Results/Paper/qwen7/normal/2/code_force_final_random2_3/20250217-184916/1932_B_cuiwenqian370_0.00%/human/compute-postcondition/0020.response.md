Output State: **`index` is 7, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 2, `n` is the sixth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the seventh element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(path)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `path` to be the seventh element of `data` converted to an integer. The other variables (`index`, `t`, `n`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
