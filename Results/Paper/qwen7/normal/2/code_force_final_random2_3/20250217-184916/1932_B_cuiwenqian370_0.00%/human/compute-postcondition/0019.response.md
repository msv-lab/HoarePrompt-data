Output State: **`index` is 7, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer and decremented by 2, `n` is the sixth element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the fifth element of `data` converted to an integer, `results` contains the return value of `func_1(path)`**.

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 6, so after the increment, `index` becomes 7. The values of `t`, `n`, `path`, and `results` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
