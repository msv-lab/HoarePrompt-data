Output State: **`index` is 4, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the second element of `data` converted to an integer, `path` is the third element of `data` converted to an integer, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is a list containing the result of `func_1(path)`, `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list. The values of `index`, `t`, `n`, `path`, `data`, and the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remain unchanged. The `results` list is updated with the result of the function call.
