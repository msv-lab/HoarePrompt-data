Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly set to 2.
- `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9.
- `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9.
- `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9.
- `res` is determined by comparing `y` and `z`. If `y` is greater than `z`, then `res` is set to 'peak'. Otherwise, `res` is set to 'none'.

The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`, which depends on the comparison between `y` and `z`.

Since `y` and `z` are both random integers between 1 and 9, their values are unknown. Therefore, `res` could be either 'peak' or 'none' depending on the specific values of `y` and `z`.

Output: **res (where res is 'peak' if y > z, otherwise 'none')**
