Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9; `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9.**

The code `z = randint(1, 9)` generates a random integer between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and assigns it to the variable `z`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
