Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', and `i` must be less than or equal to 1000.**

The code assigns the string `'none'` to the variable `res`. Since the initial value of `i` is 3 and it must be less than or equal to 1000, the only changes are in the value of `res`, which is now `'none'`. All other variables retain their initial or random values.
