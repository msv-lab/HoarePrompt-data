Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', and `i` must be less than or equal to 1000.**

Explanation: The line `res = 'none'` assigns the string `'none'` to the variable `res`. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that `i` must be less than or equal to 1000 also remains valid.
