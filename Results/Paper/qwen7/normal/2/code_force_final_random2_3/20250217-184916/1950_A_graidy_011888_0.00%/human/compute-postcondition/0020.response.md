Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'. If `y` is greater than `z`, then `res` is 'peak'. Otherwise, `res` is 'stair' if `y` is less than `z`, and 'none' if `y` is equal to `z`.
