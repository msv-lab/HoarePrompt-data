The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to 1000.

State: **`i` is 3, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is either 'peak' if `y` is greater than `z', or 'none', and `i` must be less than or equal to 1000**
