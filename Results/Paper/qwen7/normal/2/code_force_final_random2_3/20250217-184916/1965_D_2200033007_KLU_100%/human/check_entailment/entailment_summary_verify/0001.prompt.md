You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 1000000000 500000000 500000000 1000000000

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
    cts.sort()
    return cts

#Function 2:
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
    return odds

#Function 3:
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        prev = x
        idx = idx - 1
    return a

#Function 4:
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        smallList.pop()
    return bigList[-1]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function accepts two lists, `bigList` and `smallList`, both containing integers. It removes elements from the end of both lists as long as their last elements match. Once the condition no longer holds, it returns the last element of `bigList`, which will be the same as the last element of `smallList` if any elements remain.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly recovers a possible palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - This function computes all subarray sums of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through all possible starting indices `i` and ending indices `j` to compute the sum of subarrays.
   - The computed subarray sums are stored in the list `cts` and then sorted.

2. **Function `func_2(cts)`**:
   - This function aims to identify unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - It iterates through the sorted list `cts` and keeps track of the last seen sum. If the current sum matches the last seen sum, it removes the last seen sum from the list `odds`.

3. **Function `func_3(odds, n)`**:
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses the middle index `idx` to place values symmetrically around the center of the array.
   - For each unique subarray sum `x` in `odds`, it updates the corresponding positions in `a` to form a palindrome.

4. **Function `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**:
   - This function is not used in the provided code and seems unnecessary for the problem at hand.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example cases provided:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `n = 3`, subarray sums except one: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`
- Expected output: `[1, 2, 1]`

- `func_1` computes all subarray sums: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`
- `func_2` identifies unique sums: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `func_3` reconstructs the palindrome: `[1, 2, 1]`

#### Example 2:
- Input: `n = 4`, subarray sums except one: `[18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9]`
- Expected output: `[7, 2, 2, 7]`

- `func_1` computes all subarray sums: `[7, 9, 11, 18, 2, 11, 9, 7]`
- `func_2` identifies unique sums: `[7, 9, 11, 18, 2]`
- `func_3` reconstructs the palindrome: `[7, 2, 2, 7]`

#### General Case:
- The logic in `func_3` ensures that the values are placed symmetrically around the center, which is crucial for forming a palindrome.
- The unique subarray sums help in determining the values to be placed in the array.

### Conclusion

The provided functions logically follow the steps required to recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Each function performs its intended task correctly, and the overall approach is sound.
