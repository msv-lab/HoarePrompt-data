Output State: `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `sm` is equal to the sum of all elements from index `len(a) - 1` to the end of the list `a`, `cts` is a list containing all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` remains as the initial value (`len(a) - 1`) because it does not change within the loop. The variable `j` will be equal to `len(a) - 1` because it increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches the end of the list. The variable `sm` will hold the sum of all elements from the index `i` to the end of the list `a`. The list `cts` will contain all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`, as each iteration appends the current cumulative sum to the list.
