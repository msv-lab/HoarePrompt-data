Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` is the current value of `x` from the previous iteration, `idx` is either `-1` or `((n - 1) // 2 - 1)`, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2**.

Explanation: The code updates the element `a[n - 1 - idx]` to the value of `(x - prev) // 2`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged. Specifically, `odds` remains a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of the palindrome array `a` of size `n`, `prev` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `idx` stays either `-1` or `((n - 1) // 2 - 1)`.
