Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, `bigList` and `smallList`, both containing integers. It removes elements from the end of both lists as long as their last elements match. Once the condition no longer holds, it returns the last element of `bigList`, which will be the same as the last element of `smallList` if any elements remain.**
