Output State: **`sm` is equal to its previous value plus `a[j]`, `j` remains unchanged, `cts` is a list with the appended value of `sm + a[j]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sm + a[j]` to the list `cts`. Since `sm` is equal to its previous value plus `a[j]`, the new value of `sm` is updated accordingly. The value of `j` remains unchanged. The list `cts` now contains all its previous elements plus the new element `sm + a[j]`.
