Output State: The `odds` list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The `prev` variable will hold the last value of `x` from the `odds` list after the loop completes. The `idx` variable will be set to \(-1\) because it starts at \((n - 1) // 2\) and is decremented until it reaches \(-1\). The array `a` will be populated based on the values in `odds` according to the rules specified in the loop body. Specifically, for each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, the middle element of `a` will be updated to `x`. Otherwise, the elements symmetrically positioned around the center of `a` will be updated to \((x - prev) // 2\), with `prev` being the value of `x` from the previous iteration.
