Output State: **`sm` is equal to its previous value plus `a[j]`, `j` is `j + 1`, `cts` is a list with the appended value of `sm`.**

Explanation: The code `cts.append(sm)` appends the current value of `sm` to the list `cts`. The values of `sm` and `j` remain unchanged from their previous states, and `cts` now includes the updated value of `sm`.
