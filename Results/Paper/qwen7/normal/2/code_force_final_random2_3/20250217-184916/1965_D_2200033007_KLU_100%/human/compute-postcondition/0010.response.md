Output State: `bigList` is an empty list, `smallList` is a list of integers with all elements except possibly the first one removed, and the length of `smallList` is less than or equal to the length of `bigList` before the loop started. 

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `bigList` will be emptied, and `smallList` will have been reduced until either it is empty or the condition `len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` no longer holds true.
