Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` has at least one element less than before and its last element is now one less than it was before.**

Explanation: The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since the last element of `bigList` was the same as the last element of `smallList` before it was reduced by one, the last element of `smallList` is now one less than it was before. All other conditions and preconditions remain valid.
