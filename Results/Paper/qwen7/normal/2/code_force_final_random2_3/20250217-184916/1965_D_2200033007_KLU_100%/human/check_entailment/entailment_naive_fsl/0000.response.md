Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not handle the input data in a way that allows them to recover a valid palindrome array `a`. 

Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all possible subarray sums of the input list `a`. However, it does not take into account the fact that the array `a` is a palindrome. Therefore, the generated list of subarray sums does not reflect the properties of a palindrome array.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to filter out duplicate subarray sums. However, it does not consider the unique property of palindromic arrays, which means it may incorrectly remove sums that are necessary for constructing a valid palindrome.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function tries to reconstruct the palindrome array from the filtered subarray sums. However, it does not correctly handle the symmetry required for a palindrome. For example, it does not ensure that the middle element (if `n` is odd) is correctly placed, and it does not properly distribute the remaining sums to form a valid palindrome.

Given these issues, the program cannot reliably recover a valid palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
