Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the cumulative sums of subarray sums from each index to the end of the list `a` and returns them sorted. This step is crucial for identifying the missing subarray sum later.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function identifies unique subarray sums by removing duplicates. It ensures that each subarray sum appears only once in the final list `odds`.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` using the unique subarray sums. It ensures that the array is symmetric, which is a key property of the palindrome.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function helps identify the missing subarray sum by comparing the largest subarray sums from the complete list (`bigList`) and the incomplete list (`smallList`). If they match, it removes the last elements from both lists and continues until the condition no longer holds, then returns the last element of `bigList`, which should be the missing subarray sum.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the annotated functions, the overall approach seems sound. The program correctly identifies the missing subarray sum and reconstructs a valid palindrome array. Here's a breakdown of how the solution works:

- **Identify Unique Subarray Sums**: By using `func_2`, we ensure that each subarray sum is unique.
- **Reconstruct Palindrome Array**: Using `func_3`, we reconstruct the palindrome array based on the unique subarray sums.
- **Identify Missing Sum**: `func_4` helps in identifying the missing subarray sum by comparing the largest sums from the complete and incomplete lists.

Since the program correctly handles the problem constraints and logic, and the provided examples show valid outputs, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
