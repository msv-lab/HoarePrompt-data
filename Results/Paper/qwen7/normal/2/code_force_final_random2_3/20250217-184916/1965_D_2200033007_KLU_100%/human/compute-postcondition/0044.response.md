Output State: **`i` is `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(a)`, `sm` is the sum of all elements from index `0` to the end of the list `a`, and `cts` is a list of sorted cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `cts`, which contains all possible cumulative sums from each index to the end of the list `a`. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `i`, `j`, or `sm`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values. The only change is that `cts` is now sorted.
