Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 2`, and `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `v` to be the return value of `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer within the specified range, `i` remains `n - 2`, and `v` now holds the return value of `func_2()`.
