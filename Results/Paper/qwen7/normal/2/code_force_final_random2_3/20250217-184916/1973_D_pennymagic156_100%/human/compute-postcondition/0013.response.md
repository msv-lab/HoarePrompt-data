Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n - 1`, and `v` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) to `v`. Therefore, `v` now holds the value `n - 1`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
