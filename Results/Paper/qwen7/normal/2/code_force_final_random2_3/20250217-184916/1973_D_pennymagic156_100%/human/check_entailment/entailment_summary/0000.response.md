Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and maximum value equals \( m \). The solution involves querying the system to determine the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = x \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads a space-separated string of integers from standard input and returns them as a list.
   - **func_2()**: Reads an integer from standard input.
   - **func_3()**: Reads two integers from standard input and returns them as a map object.
   - **func_4()**: Reads a string from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - **func_5()**: This function seems to implement the main logic for solving the problem. It first determines the initial value \( v \) by querying the system for the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(1, r) = i \cdot n \) for decreasing values of \( i \). Then, it attempts to split the array into \( k \) subarrays with the determined \( v \) and checks if the conditions are met.

3. **Verification**:
   - **Initial Value Determination**: The function correctly iterates from \( n \) down to 1 to determine the initial value \( v \).
   - **Subarray Splitting**: The function correctly attempts to split the array into \( k \) subarrays by querying the system for the smallest \( r \) such that \( f(l, r) = i \cdot v \). If successful, it prints the value \( i \cdot v \) and terminates.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function handles the case where no valid split is found by printing `-1`.

Given the analysis, the function `func_5()` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
