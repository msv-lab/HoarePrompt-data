Output State: **`cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 3`, `func_2()` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `func_2()` is called, but its return value is not stored in any variable. The conditions `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` are true, which means `cnt` is `k - 3` and `l` is `func_2() + 3`. Since `func_2()` is called but no return value is captured, the function call itself is noted in the output state. The initial conditions remain unchanged except for the fact that `func_2()` has been executed.
