None of the variables in the provided function have explicit inputs or outputs described. The function `func_1()` reads input from standard input and returns a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string. However, since the problem description and the function signature do not include any variables, we can infer that the function is expected to read inputs for the test cases and split them into integers.
