Output State: `cnt` is `0`, `l` is `func_2() + 3`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`. Given that the loop executes 3 times, `cnt` decreases by 1 each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `cnt` will be `k - 3`. Since `l` starts at 1 and increases by `func_2() + 1` each iteration, after 3 iterations, `l` will be `1 + (func_2() + 1) * 3 = func_2() + 3`. Therefore, the final state is `cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 3`.
