Output State: **`cnt` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the value of `func_2()` plus 1. The function `func_2()` returns an integer value, which is then incremented by 1. The variables `cnt` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `cnt` is still `k`, `l` is now `func_2() + 1`, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 0.
