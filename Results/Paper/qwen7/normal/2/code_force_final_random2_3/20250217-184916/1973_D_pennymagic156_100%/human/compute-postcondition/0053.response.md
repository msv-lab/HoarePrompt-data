Output State: **`cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1, so `cnt` becomes `k - 1`. The values of `l` and `n` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. Therefore, `l` is still `func_2() + 1` and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 0.
