Output State: **`cnt` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `func_2() + 1` is less than `n + 1`**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `k - 2` to `k - 3`. The values of `l` and the condition involving `func_2()` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
