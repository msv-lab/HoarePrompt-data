Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is `k - 1`
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 0

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition involves two variables: `cnt` and `l`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions `cnt` and `l < n + 1` must be true.

4. **Analyze each variable**:
   - `cnt`: The current value is `k - 1`. For the loop to continue, `cnt` must be non-zero (i.e., `cnt > 0`).
   - `l`: The current value is `func_2() + 1`. For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `cnt` is currently `k - 1`, it is non-zero as long as `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `cnt`.
   - For `l` to be less than `n + 1`, `l` must be adjusted to ensure this condition holds.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted such that `l` is less than `n + 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` must be less than `n + 1`**
