Output State: **`cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `func_2() + 1` is less than `n + 1`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `func_2() + 1` to `l`. The initial conditions for `cnt` and the relationship between `l`, `func_2() + 1`, and `n + 1` remain unchanged. Therefore, `cnt` is still `k - 2`, `l` is now `func_2() + 1`, and the condition that `func_2() + 1` must be less than `n + 1` is still valid.
