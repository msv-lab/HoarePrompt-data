Output State: **`cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 2`**

Explanation: The code `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l`. Initially, `l` was defined as `func_2() + 1`. Now, it is updated to `func_2() + 2`. The value of `cnt` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `k - 2`. The precondition that `k` must be greater than 2 and `func_2()` must return a value less than `n` still holds true.
