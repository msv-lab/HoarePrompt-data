Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is initialized to `n`.

The Python code snippet is:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The variable `i` is initialized to `n`.
2. The expression `i * n` evaluates to `n * n` because `i` is `n`.
3. The formatted string `f'? 1 {i * n}'` will replace `{i * n}` with the value of `i * n`, which is `n * n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'? 1 n*n'` where `n * n` is the product of `n` with itself.

Output: **'? 1 n*n'**
