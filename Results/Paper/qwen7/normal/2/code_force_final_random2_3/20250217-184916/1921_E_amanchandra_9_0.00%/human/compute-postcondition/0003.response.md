Based on the initial state provided:

- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers assigned by the input split and converted to integers.
- The current value of `xa` is greater than the value of `xb`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('Draw')
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'` to the console. Since no other variables or conditions are involved in this statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **Draw**
