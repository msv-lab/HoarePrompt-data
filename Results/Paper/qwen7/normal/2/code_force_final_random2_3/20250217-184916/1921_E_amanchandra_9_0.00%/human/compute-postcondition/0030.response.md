Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the input value used to determine the number of iterations. The input value is an integer, which is used as the upper bound for the `range()` function.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers with their new values from the input.
   - `l` and `r` are integers with their previous values.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the input value.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` will be incremented again at the start of the next iteration.
   - The input value remains the same for the entire loop, so it does not change.
   - `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are updated based on the input at the start of each iteration.
   - `l` and `r` retain their previous values unless they are explicitly updated within the loop body, but since no such update is mentioned, they remain unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 again.
   - `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` will be updated based on the input.
   - `l` and `r` will retain their previous values.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers with their new values from the input.
- `l` and `r` are integers with their previous values.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers with their new values from the input, `l` and `r` are integers with their previous values.**
