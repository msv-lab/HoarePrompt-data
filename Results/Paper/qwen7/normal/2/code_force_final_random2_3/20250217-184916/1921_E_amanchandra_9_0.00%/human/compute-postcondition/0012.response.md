Output State: **`h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `yb` are integers; `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`; `xa` is less than or equal to `xb`; the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is even; `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - xa`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(w, yb + x)` to `r`. Since `x` is not defined before this line, it should be assumed that `x` is part of the input split and converted to an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions about `xa`, `xb`, `yb`, and `l` are still valid.
