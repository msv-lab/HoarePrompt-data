Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers with their new values from the input, `l`, `r` are integers with their previous values. If `xa > xb`, then `i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers with their new values from the input. Otherwise, `l` is set to either the maximum of 1 and `yb - x` or the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, and `r` is set to either the minimum of `w` and `yb + x` or the minimum of `w` and `yb + x` based on whether `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true.
