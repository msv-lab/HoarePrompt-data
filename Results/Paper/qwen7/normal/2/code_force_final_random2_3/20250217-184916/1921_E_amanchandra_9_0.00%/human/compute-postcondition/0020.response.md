Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers with their new values from the input, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, `r` are integers with their previous values, `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2.**

This means that:
- `i` has been incremented by 1.
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` have taken new integer values from the input.
- `l` is calculated as the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.
- `r` retains its previous value.
- `x` remains as the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2.
