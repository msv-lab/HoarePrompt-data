Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - It parses the board dimensions `h`, `w` and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb`.

2. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `xa > xb`. If true, it prints "Draw". This condition is correct because if Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, Alice cannot win in the first move since she can only move down, down-right, or down-left. However, this check alone is insufficient to cover all scenarios.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the vertical distance between Alice's and Bob's chips using `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
   - It then checks if this distance is odd or even using `if abs(xa - xb) % 2`.

4. **Winning Conditions**:
   - If the distance is odd, the program calculates the possible range for Alice's chip to capture Bob's chip (`l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`).
   - It then checks if Alice's chip can be within this range considering the possible moves (`abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`).

   - If the distance is even, the program calculates the possible range for Bob's chip to capture Alice's chip similarly (`l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`).
   - It then checks if Bob's chip can be within this range considering the possible moves (`abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x`).

5. **Output**:
   - Based on the above conditions, the program prints "Draw", "Alice", or "Bob".

### Detailed Analysis of Correctness:

- **Odd Distance Case**:
  - The logic for checking if Alice can capture Bob is correct. If the distance is odd, Alice can potentially capture Bob if her chip can be within the calculated range.
  - However, the program should also consider that Bob can move to avoid capture. If Bob can always move to avoid capture, the game would end in a draw.

- **Even Distance Case**:
  - The logic for checking if Bob can capture Alice is correct. If the distance is even, Bob can potentially capture Alice if his chip can be within the calculated range.
  - Similarly, the program should also consider that Alice can move to avoid capture. If Alice can always move to avoid capture, the game would end in a draw.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program does not handle edge cases where Alice or Bob might be forced into a position where they cannot avoid capture, which could lead to a win for the other player.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not fully account for all possible scenarios and edge cases. Specifically, it does not ensure that the game ends in a draw when neither player can force a win. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

**Correctness: False**
