Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers with their new values from the input, `l`, `r` are integers with their previous values. If `xa > xb`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `l` is set to the maximum of 1 and either `yb - x` (if `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true) or `ya - x`, and `r` is set to the minimum of `w` and either `yb + x` (if `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true) or `yb + x`.
