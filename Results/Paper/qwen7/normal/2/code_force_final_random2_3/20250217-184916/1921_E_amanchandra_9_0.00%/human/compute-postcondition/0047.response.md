Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of six integers \(h\), \(w\), \(x_a\), \(y_a\), \(x_b\), and \(y_b\). For each test case, it determines whether Alice or Bob wins based on the positions \(x_a\) and \(x_b\) and the ranges defined by \(y_a\) and \(y_b\). If \(x_a > x_b\), the function prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it checks specific conditions to decide between 'Alice' or 'Bob'. The function outputs the results for each test case and the total number of test cases processed.**
