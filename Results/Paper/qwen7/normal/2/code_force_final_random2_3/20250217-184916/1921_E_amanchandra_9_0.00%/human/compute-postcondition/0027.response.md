Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, `yb` are integers with their new values from the input. If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true, then `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. Otherwise, `l` is the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`, and `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.
