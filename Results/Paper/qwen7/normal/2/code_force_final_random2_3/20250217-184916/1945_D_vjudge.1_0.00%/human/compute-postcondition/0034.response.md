Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n - k`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` in the range `range(n - k, n)`. This means `i` should be initialized to `n - k` at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the Value of `n - k`**: Since `i` starts at `n - k`, `n - k` must be a valid starting point for the loop. This implies that `n - k` should be a non-negative integer (since `i` starts from this value and increments).

4. **Initial Values of Other Variables**: The other variables (`resultado`, `pref`, `soma_b`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, and `pref`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their initial values do not affect whether the loop starts or not. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above steps, the only adjustments needed are for the variables `i` and `n - k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n - k`, `n - k` must be a non-negative integer**
