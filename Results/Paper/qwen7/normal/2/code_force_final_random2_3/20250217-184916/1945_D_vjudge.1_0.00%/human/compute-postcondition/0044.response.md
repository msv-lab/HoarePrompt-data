Output State: `i` is `n - 1`; `soma_b` is the sum of `lista_B` from index `n - k` to `n - 1`; `pref` is the sum of elements from `lista_A` that are smaller than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` up to index `n - k - 1`; `resultado` is the minimum value between its initial state (infinity) and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[n - 1]`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will have reached the last index of the loop (`n - 1`), `soma_b` will hold the cumulative sum of `lista_B` from the start of the loop until the end, `pref` will store the sum of elements from `lista_A` that are smaller than their corresponding elements in `lista_B` up to the point where the loop started, and `resultado` will be the smallest value found during the loop, which is the minimum of the initial `resultado` and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and the current element of `lista_A`.
