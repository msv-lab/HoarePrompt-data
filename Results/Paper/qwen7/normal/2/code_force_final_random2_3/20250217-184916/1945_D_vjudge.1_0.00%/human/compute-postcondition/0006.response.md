Output State: **`func_1()` has been called again.**

Explanation: The code `func_1()` is called, which means `func_1()` has been called twice. The precondition that `numero_testes` must be greater than 1 remains valid, but since no specific value was given for `numero_testes`, we cannot update its value. The only change is that `func_1()` has been called once more.
