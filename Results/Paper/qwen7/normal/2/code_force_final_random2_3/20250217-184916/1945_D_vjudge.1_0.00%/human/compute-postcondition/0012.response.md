Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than `k`, `pref` is equal to `lista_A[0]`, and `soma_b` is 0, `lista_A[0]` is less than `lista_B[0]`**

Explanation: The line `soma_b = 0` sets the variable `soma_b` to 0. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `pref`, `lista_A[0]`, and `lista_B[0]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
