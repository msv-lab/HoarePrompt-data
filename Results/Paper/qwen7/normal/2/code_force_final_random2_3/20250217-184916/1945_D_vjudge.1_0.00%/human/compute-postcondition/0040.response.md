Output State: **`i` is `n - k`, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[n - k + 1]`, `resultado` remains the same**

Explanation: The variable `i` was originally `n - k + 1`. After executing `soma_b += lista_B[i]`, `i` is updated to `n - k` (since `i` is incremented by 1 in the process of accessing `lista_B[i]`). The value of `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[n - k + 1]`, which is the element at the index `i` after the increment. The variable `resultado` remains unchanged.
