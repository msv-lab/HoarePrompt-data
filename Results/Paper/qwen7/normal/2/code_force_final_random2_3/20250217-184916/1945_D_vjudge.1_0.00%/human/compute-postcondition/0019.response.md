Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than `k`, `pref` is equal to `lista_A[0]` + `soma_b` + `lista_A[1]`, and `soma_b` remains as defined by the initial condition.**

Explanation: The variable `pref` is updated by adding `lista_A[i]` to its current value. Initially, `i` is 1, so `pref` is equal to `lista_A[0]` + `soma_b`. After executing `pref += lista_A[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1 (making it 2), and `pref` becomes `lista_A[0]` + `soma_b` + `lista_A[1]`. The other variables (`n` and `k`) remain unchanged, and `soma_b` also remains as defined by the initial condition.
