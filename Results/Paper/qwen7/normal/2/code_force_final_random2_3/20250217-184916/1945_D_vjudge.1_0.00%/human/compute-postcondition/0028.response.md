Output State: **`i` is 3, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[2]`**

Explanation: The code `soma_b += lista_B[i]` increments the value of `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after executing the code, `i` becomes 3 (since list indices start from 0), and `soma_b` is updated to its current value plus `lista_B[2]`. The condition `n > k` remains true as per the initial state.
