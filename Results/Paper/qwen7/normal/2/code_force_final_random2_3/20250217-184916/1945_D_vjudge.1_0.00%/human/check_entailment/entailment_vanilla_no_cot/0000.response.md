Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in how it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions. The current implementation reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which is unnecessary and incorrect for solving the problem as stated. Additionally, the logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Initialize prefix sums for b values
    prefix_sum_b = [0] * n
    prefix_sum_b[0] = lista_B[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        prefix_sum_b[i] = prefix_sum_b[i-1] + lista_B[i]

    # Initialize the result with a large value
    resultado = float('inf')

    # Calculate the minimum cost to get into one of the first m positions
    for i in range(m):
        cost = 0
        if i > 0:
            cost += prefix_sum_b[i-1]
        cost += lista_A[i]
        resultado = min(resultado, cost)

    print(resultado)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We calculate the prefix sum of `b` values to efficiently compute the total cost of moving past previous people.
2. **Cost Calculation**: For each position from 0 to `m-1`, we calculate the cost of moving to that position and update the minimum cost.
3. **Result Output**: Finally, we output the minimum cost found.

This approach ensures that we correctly compute the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in the queue.
