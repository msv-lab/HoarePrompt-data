Output State: `i` is `n - 1`; `soma_b` is the sum of `lista_B` from index `n - k` to `n - 1`; `pref` is the cumulative sum of `lista_A` from index `n - k` to `n - 2`; `resultado` is the minimum value obtained from the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for each iteration of the loop.

In this final state, the loop has executed for all iterations from `i = n - k` to `i = n - 1`. The variable `i` has reached its maximum value of `n - 1`. The variable `soma_b` contains the sum of all elements in `lista_B` from the start of the loop until the last iteration. The variable `pref` holds the cumulative sum of `lista_A` from the start of the loop until the second-to-last iteration. The variable `resultado` retains the minimum value calculated during any iteration of the loop using the formula `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
