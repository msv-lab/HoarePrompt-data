You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, lista_A is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and lista_B is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - k - 1`, `pref` will be the sum of all `lista_A[i]` where `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` plus the cumulative sum of `lista_B[i]` where `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` from `i=0` to `i=n-k-1`, and `soma_b` will be 0 if there was no `lista_A[i]` that was greater than or equal to `lista_B[i]` from `i=0` to `i=n-k-1`.
    #
    #This means that `pref` accumulates the values from `lista_A` when the corresponding elements in `lista_A` are smaller than those in `lista_B`, and also adds the cumulative sum of `lista_B` when `lista_A` elements are not smaller. `soma_b` remains 0 because it gets reset to 0 whenever a condition is met in the if statement.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `n - 1`; `soma_b` is the sum of `lista_B` from index `n - k` to `n - 1`; `pref` is the cumulative sum of `lista_A` from index `n - k` to `n - 2`; `resultado` is the minimum value obtained from the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #In this final state, the loop has executed for all iterations from `i = n - k` to `i = n - 1`. The variable `i` has reached its maximum value of `n - 1`. The variable `soma_b` contains the sum of all elements in `lista_B` from the start of the loop until the last iteration. The variable `pref` holds the cumulative sum of `lista_A` from the start of the loop until the second-to-last iteration. The variable `resultado` retains the minimum value calculated during any iteration of the loop using the formula `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: resultado (the minimum value obtained from the expression pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for each iteration of the loop)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two lists, lista_A and lista_B, both containing n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, and two positive integers n and k where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000. The function returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
