Output State: **`i` is `n - k + 1`, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[n - k]`, `resultado` remains the same**

This means that at the start of the next iteration of the loop:
- The variable `i` is now `n - k + 1`.
- The variable `soma_b` has been increased by the value of `lista_B[n - k]`.
- The variable `resultado` has not changed from its previous value.
