Output State: The value of `numero_testes` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^4\) and `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `func_1()` will have been called exactly `numero_testes` times, and the value of `numero_testes` itself does not change during the loop's execution; it only determines how many times the function `func_1()` is called.
