Output State: **`numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^4\)**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignments or modifications to `numero_testes` are shown), the value of `numero_testes` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only information that remains valid is the initial condition about `numero_testes`.
