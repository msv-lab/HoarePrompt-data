Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not handle the scenario where Kirill needs to minimize the cost of bribing people in front of him to move closer to the front of the queue.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Input:
```
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

### Expected Output:
To achieve the minimum cost, Kirill should bribe the first two people in the queue:
- Bribing the first person costs 7 coins.
- Bribing the second person costs 4 coins.

So, the total cost should be \(7 + 4 = 11\) coins.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly calculate this cost. Instead, it seems to be calculating a different value based on the reversed lists and some undefined logic.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Reversing Lists**: The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed before processing, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost is flawed. It does not correctly account for the bribing process and the incremental cost for each subsequent person.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
