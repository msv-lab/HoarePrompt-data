Output State: **`i` is 3, `pref` is `pref` + `lista_A[3]`.**

Explanation: The code `pref += lista_A[i]` increments `pref` by the value of `lista_A[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 2, after executing the code, `i` is updated to 3 (since list indices start from 0). The value of `pref` is updated to its current value plus the value of `lista_A[3]`. The condition that `n` must be greater than `k` remains unchanged, and the expression `pref` is `pref` + `soma_b` also remains valid but with the updated value of `pref`.
