Output State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 2, `li` is a list containing the values `a + k * c + d * 1`, `a + k * c + d * 1`, and `a + k * c + d * 2`, `a + k * c + d * 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given that `k` is 0, `h` is 2, and the existing elements in `li` are `a + k * c + d * 1`, the new element added to the list is `a + k * c + d * 2`, which simplifies to `a + 0 * c + d * 2` or simply `a + 2d`. Therefore, the updated list `li` contains the values `a + d`, `a + d`, and `a + 2d`. However, since the exact values of `a`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, the general form is maintained as shown.
