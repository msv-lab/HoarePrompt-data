You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    print(func_1(n, m, a))

def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
    return needed_problems



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 50), `m` (an integer between 1 and 5), and `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). It calculates and returns `needed_problems`, which is 7 times the difference between `m` and the minimum count of occurrences of each character ('A' to 'G') in the string `a`, if any character count is less than `m`. If all character counts are greater than or equal to `m`, then `needed_problems` is 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can conduct `m` rounds, each requiring one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. 

2. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems in the bank) and `m` (number of upcoming rounds).
   - It also reads a string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed.
   - It initializes a list `count` of size 7 (to represent the counts of difficulties 'A' to 'G').
   - It iterates over the string `a`, updating the count of each difficulty level.
   - It then calculates how many more problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.
   - Finally, it sums up the required additional problems for all difficulty levels.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the number of problems in the bank might be less than the required number of problems for `m` rounds.
   - It correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.
