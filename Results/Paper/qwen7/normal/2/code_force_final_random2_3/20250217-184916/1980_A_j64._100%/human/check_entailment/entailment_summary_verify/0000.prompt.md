You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    print(func_1(n, m, a))

def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
    return needed_problems



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 50), `m` (an integer between 1 and 5), and `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). It calculates and returns `needed_problems`, which is 7 times the difference between `m` and the minimum count of occurrences of each character ('A' to 'G') in the string `a`, if any character count is less than `m`. If all character counts are greater than or equal to `m`, then `needed_problems` is 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he can hold `m` rounds with at least one problem of each difficulty level. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Counting Problem Difficulties**: The program counts the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using the `count` array. This ensures that we know how many problems of each difficulty are already available.

2. **Calculating Needed Problems**: For each difficulty level, the program checks if the current count is less than `m`. If it is, the difference (`m - count[i]`) represents the number of additional problems needed for that difficulty level.

3. **Summing Up**: The total number of additional problems needed is the sum of these differences for all difficulty levels.

Given the constraints and the logic used, the program handles all potential cases correctly. It accounts for the possibility of needing to create multiple problems for different difficulty levels and sums them up accurately. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
