Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `p` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `res` remain unchanged. The new list `a` is created based on the user's input.
