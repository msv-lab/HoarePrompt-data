Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `p` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1, `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
