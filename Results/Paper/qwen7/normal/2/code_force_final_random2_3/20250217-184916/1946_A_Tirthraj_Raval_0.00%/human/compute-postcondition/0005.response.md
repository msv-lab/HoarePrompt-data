Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `a` is modified to be sorted.
