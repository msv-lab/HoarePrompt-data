Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `p` is (n + 1) // 2 - 1.**

This means that the variable `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, where `n` is an input integer. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
