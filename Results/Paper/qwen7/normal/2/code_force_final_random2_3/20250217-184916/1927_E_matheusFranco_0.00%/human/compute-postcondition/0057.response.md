Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and the provided code snippet, the function does not accept any parameters. The constraints describe conditions that should hold true for the values of `n` and `k` if they were passed to a function, but since the function definition provided does not include any parameters, it implies that the function does not take any inputs and thus does not return anything.
