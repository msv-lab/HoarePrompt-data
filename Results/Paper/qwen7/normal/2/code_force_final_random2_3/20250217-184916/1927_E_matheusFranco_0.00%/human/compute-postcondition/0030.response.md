Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 2, `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where the second element is 6, `curr_v` is 7, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 7.**

Explanation: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is incremented by `k`, which is 2. Initially, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 5. So, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes 5 + 2 = 7. All other variables remain unchanged.
