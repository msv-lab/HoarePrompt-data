Output State: All elements in `permutation` from index `i` to `i + (n-1)*k` (where `n` is the number of iterations the loop executed) will be filled with consecutive integers starting from `i`, and the remaining elements in `permutation` will remain unchanged.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will eventually become greater than or equal to `len(permutation)`. During each iteration, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated to the current value of `curr_v`, which increments by 1 each time through the loop. The loop runs for as many times as necessary until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` exceeds the length of `permutation`. Therefore, the elements of `permutation` that are accessed and updated will form a sequence of consecutive integers starting from `i`, with a step size determined by `k`. The exact range of indices that get updated depends on the values of `i` and `k`, but it will cover all indices that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches before it exceeds the length of `permutation`.
