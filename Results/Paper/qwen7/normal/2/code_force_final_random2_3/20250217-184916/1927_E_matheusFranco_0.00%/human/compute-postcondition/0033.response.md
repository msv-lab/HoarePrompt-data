Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 7, `permutation` has its `multiples_of_k_plus_i` index updated with `curr_v` + 1, `curr_v` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` remains 7, and the `multiples_of_k_plus_i` index of `permutation` is updated with the new value of `curr_v + 1`. Additionally, `curr_v` is increased by 1. The condition that `n` must be greater than 7 is still valid but not directly affected by the given code snippet.
