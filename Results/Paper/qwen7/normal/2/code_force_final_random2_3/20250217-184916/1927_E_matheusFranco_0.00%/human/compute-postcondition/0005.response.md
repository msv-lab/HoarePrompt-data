Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, and the function `func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_1()` calls a function named `func_1()`. No variables are updated or assigned new values within this snippet. The initial state of `t` being a positive integer less than its initial value by 1 and greater than 0 remains unchanged. The only action taken is the call to `func_1()`, which does not modify any variables.
