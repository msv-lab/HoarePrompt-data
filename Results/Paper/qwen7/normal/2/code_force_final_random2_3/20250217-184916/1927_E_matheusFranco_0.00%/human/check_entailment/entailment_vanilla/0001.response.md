Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given constraints.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a permutation of length `n` such that for any two sums of continuous segments of length `k`, the difference between these sums is at most 1.
   - The program should handle multiple test cases.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
   - It initializes an array `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses a loop to fill the array in a specific pattern:
     - It starts with `curr_v = 1`.
     - For each index `i` in the range `[0, k)`, it places `curr_v` at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` until it reaches the end of the array.
     - It increments `curr_v` after placing it in each position.
   - Finally, it prints the permutation as a space-separated string.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and then decrements `t`.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The pattern used in `func_1` ensures that each segment of length `k` will have a consistent set of values repeated.
   - Specifically, the values placed at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` will be the same for each `i` in the range `[0, k)`.
   - This means that the sum of any segment of length `k` will be the same, ensuring that the condition for a k-level permutation is satisfied.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints properly, including the guarantee that `k` is even and `k <= n`.
   - The program also ensures that the permutation is of length `n` and contains all integers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by using a loop in `func_2`.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to generate a k-level permutation for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
