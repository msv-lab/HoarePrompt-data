Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 2, `idx` is 1, `idx_v` is 4, `permutation` is a list of `n` elements where every `2 * 2`-th element (starting from 2) is set to `2 + 1`, `curr_v` is 6, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2, and the second element of `permutation` is now 5.**

Explanation: The code `curr_v += 1` increments the value of `curr_v` by 1. Since `curr_v` was initially 5, after executing this line, `curr_v` becomes 6. All other variables remain unchanged.
