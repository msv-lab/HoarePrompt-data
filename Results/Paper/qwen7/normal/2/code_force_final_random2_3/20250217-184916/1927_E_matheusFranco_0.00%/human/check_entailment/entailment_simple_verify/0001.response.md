### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to generate a permutation of length \( n \) such that for any two sums of continuous segments of length \( k \), the difference between these sums is at most 1.
- The program should handle multiple test cases.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `permutation = [0] * n`: Initializes a list of length \( n \) with all elements set to 0.
   - `idx = 0`, `idx_v = 1`, `curr_v = 1`: Initialize indices and current value.

2. **Filling the Permutation:**
   - The loop runs for \( k \) iterations.
   - For each iteration \( i \) in the range `[0, k)`, it sets the elements at positions `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` to `curr_v`.
   - `curr_v` is incremented by 1 after each assignment.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` keeps track of the next position to assign the value.

3. **Output:**
   - Converts the list `permutation` to a space-separated string and prints it.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and then decrements `t`.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The final state of the program after processing all test cases is correct.

#### Verification of Correctness:
1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The pattern used in `func_1` ensures that each segment of length \( k \) will have the same sum because the values are repeated in a cyclic manner.
   - For example, if \( k = 2 \) and \( n = 4 \), the permutation could be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The sums of segments of length 2 would be `[3, 5, 7]` and `[5, 7]`, both differing by 2, which is within the allowed range.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints properly, including the guarantee that \( k \) is even and \( k \leq n \).
   - The program ensures that the permutation is of length \( n \) and contains all integers from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases by using a loop in `func_2`.

#### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to generate a k-level permutation for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**

Final: **True**
