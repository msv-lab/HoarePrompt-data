Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is equal to `i`.
3. **Analyze the loop condition**: For the loop to execute at least once, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
4. **Check the current value**: Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is equal to `i`, the loop will execute if `i < len(permutation)`.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` such that it satisfies the loop condition `i < len(permutation)`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to reflect that `i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

**State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now equal to `i`, and `i` must be less than `len(permutation)`**
