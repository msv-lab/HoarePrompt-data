Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider scenarios where the number of coins `n` is greater than `k` but less than `k + (k-1)`. Hereâ€™s an example:

### Example Case
Consider the following input:
```
3
7 3
6 4
255 8
```

#### Test Case 1: `n = 7`, `k = 3`
- The program correctly identifies that Alice can buy exactly 3 jewels by setting up 1 stall with a price of 7 coins.
- Output should be:
  ```
  YES
  1
  7
  ```

#### Test Case 2: `n = 6`, `k = 4`
- The program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not consider setting up stalls with decreasing prices to allow Alice to buy exactly 4 jewels.
- A correct setup would be:
  ```
  YES
  4
  6 5 4 3
  ```

#### Test Case 3: `n = 255`, `k = 8`
- The program correctly identifies that Alice can buy exactly 8 jewels by setting up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1.
- Output should be:
  ```
  YES
  8
  128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
  ```

The provided program does not handle the scenario where `n > k` and `k - 1 < n - k + 1` correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for certain cases. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.
