Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than `k`.
- The current value of `(k - 1)` is less than the current value of `(n - k + 1)`.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(n - k + 1, 1)
```

Let's break down the values being printed:

1. **`n - k + 1`**: Since `n` is an integer greater than `k`, the expression `n - k + 1` will be a positive integer. Specifically, it represents the difference between `n` and `k` plus one. Given the condition that `(k - 1)` is less than `(n - k + 1)`, this expression is well-defined and positive.

2. **`1`**: This is a constant integer value.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output two values: the result of the expression `n - k + 1` and the integer `1`.

Output: **n - k + 1, 1**
