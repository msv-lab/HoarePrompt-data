Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is less than `k`, then the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000` and `n < k` holds. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000` and `n ≥ k` holds. Additionally, if `n` equals `k`, `n` remains unchanged. If `n` does not equal `k`, then either the condition `(k - 1) < (n - k + 1)` holds, or the condition `(k - 1) ≥ (n - k + 1)` holds.
