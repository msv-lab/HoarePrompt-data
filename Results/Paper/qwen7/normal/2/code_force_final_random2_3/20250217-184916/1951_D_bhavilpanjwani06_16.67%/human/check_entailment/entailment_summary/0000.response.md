Reasoning:

1. The problem requires Bob to set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
2. The provided code only handles three specific cases:
   - When \( n < k \), it correctly prints "NO".
   - When \( n = k \), it prints "YES", 1, and \( n \).
   - When \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \), it prints "YES", 2, and \( n - k + 1 \) and 1.
3. However, the problem statement mentions that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and the prices can be any integer between 1 and \( 10^{18} \).
4. The code does not consider the possibility of setting up more than 2 stalls when \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 \geq n - k + 1 \). It only considers setting up 2 stalls in this case.
5. Additionally, the code does not handle the general case where more than 2 stalls might be needed to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.

Given these points, the provided code is incomplete and does not cover all necessary scenarios to solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
