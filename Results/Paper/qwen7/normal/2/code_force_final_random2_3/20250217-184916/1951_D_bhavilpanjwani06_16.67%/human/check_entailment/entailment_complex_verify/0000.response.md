### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the correctness of the program based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap
- Alice has `n` coins.
- Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with prices between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she runs out of coins.

#### Given Program Analysis
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    elif n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(n)
    elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(n - k + 1, 1)
    else:
        print('NO')
```

#### Annotated Code Analysis
1. **Initial State**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - Checks if `n < k`. If true, prints "NO".
   - Checks if `n == k`. If true, prints "YES", 1, and `n`.
   - Checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. If true, prints "YES", 2, and `n - k + 1` and 1.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, prints "NO".

#### Correctness Evaluation
1. **Case 1: \( n < k \)**
   - The program correctly prints "NO".
   
2. **Case 2: \( n == k \)**
   - The program correctly prints "YES", 1, and `n`.

3. **Case 3: \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \)**
   - The program correctly prints "YES", 2, and `n - k + 1` and 1.
     - For example, if \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 4 \):
       - \( k - 1 = 3 \)
       - \( n - k + 1 = 3 \)
       - Since \( 3 < 3 \), the program prints "YES", 2, and 3 and 1.
       - This allows Alice to buy 4 jewels: 3 jewels at 3 coins each and 1 jewel at 1 coin.

4. **Case 4: \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 \geq n - k + 1 \)**
   - The program incorrectly prints "NO".
     - For example, if \( n = 255 \) and \( k = 8 \):
       - \( k - 1 = 7 \)
       - \( n - k + 1 = 248 \)
       - Since \( 7 \geq 248 \), the program prints "NO".
       - However, a correct setup would be to use stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly 8 jewels.

#### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the cases where \( n < k \) and \( n == k \). However, it fails to handle the case where \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \) correctly. The original assessment is accurate in pointing out this flaw.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**

The program is not fully correct as it fails to handle the scenario where \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \) correctly.
