### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
   - If \( n < k \), it's impossible for Alice to buy \( k \) jewels, so we print "NO".
   - If \( n = k \), Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels by spending all her coins at one stall, so we print "YES" and the number of stalls as 1 with the price equal to \( n \).
   - If \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \), we can use a strategy to split the purchases across multiple stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels. Specifically, we can have one stall with price \( n - k + 1 \) and another stall with price 1, allowing Alice to buy \( k-1 \) jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
   - Otherwise, it is impossible to achieve exactly \( k \) jewels, so we print "NO".

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly handles the three main conditions mentioned above.
     - It checks if \( n < k \) and prints "NO" if true.
     - It checks if \( n = k \) and prints "YES" with 1 stall and the price equal to \( n \).
     - It checks if \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \) and prints "YES" with 2 stalls if true, setting the prices accordingly.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NO".

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge cases correctly:
     - When \( n < k \), it correctly prints "NO".
     - When \( n = k \), it correctly prints "YES" with 1 stall.
     - When \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \), it correctly prints "YES" with 2 stalls.
     - For other cases, it correctly prints "NO".

4. **Detailed Analysis Using Annotations**:
   - The annotated code shows that the program correctly processes each test case according to the conditions specified.
   - For the first test case (7 3):
     - \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 3 \). Since \( n > k \), the code proceeds to check the next condition.
     - \( n - k + 1 = 5 \) and \( k - 1 = 2 \). Since \( 2 < 5 \), the code prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices 5 and 1.
   - For the second test case (6 4):
     - \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 4 \). Since \( n > k \), the code proceeds to check the next condition.
     - \( n - k + 1 = 3 \) and \( k - 1 = 3 \). Since \( 3 \geq 3 \), the code prints "NO".
   - For the third test case (255 8):
     - \( n = 255 \) and \( k = 8 \). Since \( n > k \), the code proceeds to check the next condition.
     - \( n - k + 1 = 248 \) and \( k - 1 = 7 \). Since \( 7 < 248 \), the code prints "YES" and sets up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The code logic matches the problem requirements and handles all the given conditions accurately.
