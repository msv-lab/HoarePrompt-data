### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- Alice has `n` coins and wants to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with prices between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she runs out of coins or reaches the last stall.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1()` processes a single test case.
- It checks if \( n \geq k \).
- If \( n < k \), it prints "NO".
- If \( n = k \), it prints "YES", 1, and \( n \).
- If \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \), it prints "YES", 2, and \( n - k + 1 \) and 1.
- Otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Program Code Analysis:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    elif n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(n)
    elif k - 1 < n - k + 1:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(n - k + 1, 1)
    else:
        print('NO')
```

#### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Case \( n < k \)**:
   - The program correctly prints "NO" when \( n < k \).

2. **Case \( n = k \)**:
   - The program correctly prints "YES", 1, and \( n \).

3. **Case \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \)**:
   - The program incorrectly handles this case. According to the problem, Bob can set up stalls with decreasing prices to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
   - For example, if \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 4 \), the correct setup would be:
     ```
     YES
     4
     6 5 4 3
     ```
   - However, the program prints "NO" in this case.

4. **Case \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 \geq n - k + 1 \)**:
   - The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

#### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly handle the scenario where \( n > k \) and \( k - 1 < n - k + 1 \). It does not account for the possibility of setting up multiple stalls with decreasing prices to ensure Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is not fully correct as it does not handle all potential cases according to the problem description.
