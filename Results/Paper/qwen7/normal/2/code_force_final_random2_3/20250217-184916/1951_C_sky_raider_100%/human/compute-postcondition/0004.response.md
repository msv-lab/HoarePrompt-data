Output State: **`l` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `t` to 0. Since the initial values of `l`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are unchanged, they remain as input integers. The only new information is that `t` is now set to 0.
