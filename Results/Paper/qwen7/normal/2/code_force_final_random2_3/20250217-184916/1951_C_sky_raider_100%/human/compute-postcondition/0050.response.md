Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`, `t` is `n * s`, `k` is decreased by `n * s`, `i` is `n + 1`, `c` is the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This updates the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. The values of `s`, `t`, `k`, `i`, and `c` are defined based on the initial state but are not updated by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain as per the initial state description.
