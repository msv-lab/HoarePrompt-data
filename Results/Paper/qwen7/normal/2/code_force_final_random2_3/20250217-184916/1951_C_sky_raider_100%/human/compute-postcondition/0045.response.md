Output State: **`total` is 0, `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`, `t` is `4 * s`, `c` is increased by `2 * s * (l[i + 2] + t)`, `k` is decreased by `s`, `i` is `i + 2**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `t` is set to `3 * s`.
- After executing `t += s`, `t` becomes `4 * s`.
- The other variables (`total`, `s`, `c`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
