Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers n, m, and k, followed by a list of n integers. It then sorts the list and calculates a cumulative sum based on the values of n, m, k, and the sorted list. Finally, it prints the calculated cumulative sum for each test case.**
