Output State: **`total` is 0, `s` is equal to `min(m, k)`, `t` is `s + 2s`, `c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`, `k` is decreased by `s`, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is updated to its previous value plus `s * (l[i] + t)`**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `t` is calculated as `s + s`.
- After executing `t += s`, `t` is now `s + s + s`, which simplifies to `s + 2s` or `3s`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or updated states as per the given code snippet.
