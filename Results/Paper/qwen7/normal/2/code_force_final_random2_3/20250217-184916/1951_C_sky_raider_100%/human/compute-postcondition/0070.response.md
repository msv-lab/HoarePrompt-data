Output State: **`s` is now the minimum of `m` and `k`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t + s + s`, `k` is decreased by `2s`, `c` is `c + s * (l[i] + t), `t` is increased by `s`.**

Explanation: The code `k -= s` decreases the value of `k` by `s`. Since `s` was previously defined as the minimum of `m` and `k`, and `k` was decreased by `s`, `k` is now decreased by `2s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
