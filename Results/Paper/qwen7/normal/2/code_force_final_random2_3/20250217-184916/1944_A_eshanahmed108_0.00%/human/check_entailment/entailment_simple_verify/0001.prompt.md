You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). For each test case, `n` is the integer input received on the line where `n` and `k` are defined, and `k` is the integer input received on the same line as `n`. The loop processes each test case independently, so the final values of `n` and `k` will be the last set of inputs provided within the range of `t` test cases.
    #
    #This means that the final values of `n` and `k` will be those obtained from the last test case processed by the loop, given the constraints on `t`, `n`, and `k`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys at most `k` bridges.
   - Everule starts on island 1 and can travel through any remaining bridges.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If `n - k <= 1`, it means that after destroying `k` bridges, at least one island remains accessible from island 1 (including island 1 itself).
   - If `n - k > 1`, it means that more than one island remains accessible from island 1, so the answer is 1 because we want the minimum number of islands.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `n - k <= 1`. If true, it prints `n` (which is the number of islands). Otherwise, it prints `1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - When `n - k <= 1`, the program correctly prints `n` because it ensures that at least one island remains accessible.
   - When `n - k > 1`, the program correctly prints `1` because it ensures that the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is 1.

Given this analysis, the program logic matches the problem requirements accurately.
