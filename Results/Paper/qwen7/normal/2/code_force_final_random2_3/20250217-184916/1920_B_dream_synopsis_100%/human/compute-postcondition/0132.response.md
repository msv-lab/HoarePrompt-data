Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list containing `[a[0] - 2 * a[x]]`, `sums` is `a[0] - 2 * a[x]`**.

The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given that `sums` is defined as `a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, the list `ans` now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
