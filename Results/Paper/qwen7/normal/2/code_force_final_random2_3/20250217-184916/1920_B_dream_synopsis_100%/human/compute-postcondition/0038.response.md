Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is the same as before, `sums` is `a[1]` (since `i-1` is 1), and `ans` is a list containing `[sums]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `sums` by adding `a[i-1]` to `sums`. Given that `i` is 2, `i-1` is 1. So, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]`. Since `sums` was initially updated according to the condition `i + x - 1 < n`, and now it's being updated again, we assume `sums` is now `a[1]`. The `ans` list is initialized and appended with the new value of `sums`, making it a list containing `[sums]`.
