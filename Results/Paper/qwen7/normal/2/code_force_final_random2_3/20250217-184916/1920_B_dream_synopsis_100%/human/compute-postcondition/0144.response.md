Functionality: The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It sorts the list in descending order, calculates a series of sums based on the sorted list and the given parameters `k` and `x`, and prints the maximum sum among these calculations. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
