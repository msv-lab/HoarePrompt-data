Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`, `ans` depends on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[0]` since `i` is 1) and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is only used in the calculation. The value of `k` is also unchanged as it was not involved in the calculation. The value of `ans` depends on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`, which remains unchanged unless `x` or `n` changes, but since no such change is mentioned, `ans` still depends on the same condition.
