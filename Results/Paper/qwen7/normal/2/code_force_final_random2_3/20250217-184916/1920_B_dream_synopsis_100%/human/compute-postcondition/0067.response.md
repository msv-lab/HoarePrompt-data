Postcondition: `i` is within the range [0, k]; `sums` is updated; `ans` is a list containing either one element which is `sums` or `[sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]]`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and reversed; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `i` is not equal to 0; and depending on whether `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated accordingly.
