Output State: **`sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`; `ans` now includes the value of `sums`; `i` is within the range `[0, k-1]`; `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration; `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `sum1` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, this value is added to `ans`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
