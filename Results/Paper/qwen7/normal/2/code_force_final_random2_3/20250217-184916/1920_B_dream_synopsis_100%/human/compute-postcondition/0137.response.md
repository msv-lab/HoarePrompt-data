Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list. If `i` is 0, then `ans` contains an element equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(ans[:x])` and `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(ans[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `ans` contains `[a[0] - 2 * a[x]]` and `sums` is `a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. Otherwise, `ans` contains `a[0]` and `sums` is `a[0]`.
