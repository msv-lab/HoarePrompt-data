Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers in reverse order, `n`, `k`, and `x` are their respective integer values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a`. Since `a` was initially a sorted list of integers, after reversing, `a` will contain the same integers but in reverse order. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the operation.
