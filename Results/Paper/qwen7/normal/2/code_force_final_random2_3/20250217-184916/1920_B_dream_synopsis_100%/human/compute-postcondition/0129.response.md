Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(ans[:x])**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` to be the value of `sum1` minus twice the sum of the first `x` elements of the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
