Output State: **`sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `i` is within the range `[0, k-1]`, `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `sum1` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**

This output state reflects that the only change is in the value of `sums`, which is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. All other variables retain their values from the previous state.
