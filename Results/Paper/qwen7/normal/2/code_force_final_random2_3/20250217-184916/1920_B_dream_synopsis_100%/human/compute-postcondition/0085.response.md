Output State: **`i` is within the range [1, k], `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value, `ans` includes the updated value of `sums` if the conditions are met, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same, and `a` and `sum1` remain unchanged.**

This means that the value of `sums` has been updated by adding the element `a[i - 1]` to its current value. The other variables (`i`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
