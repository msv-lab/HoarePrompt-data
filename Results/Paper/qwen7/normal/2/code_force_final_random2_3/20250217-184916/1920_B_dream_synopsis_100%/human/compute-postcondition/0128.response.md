Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1 (as per the postcondition).
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop.

4. **Check the new value of `i`**:
   - If `i` was previously `0`, now `i` is `1`.
   - If `i` was previously `1`, now `i` is `2`, and so on.

5. **Determine the new condition for the loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i <= k`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `k` remains the same.
   - The conditions for `ans` depend on the value of `i` and `x`, but these are not part of the loop head and thus not adjusted here.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list.**

Since `i` is incremented by 1, if `i` was `0` before, now `i` is `1`. Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list.**
