Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated, `ans` is now an empty list, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and reversed, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = []` initializes `ans` as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
