Output State: **`i` is an integer and not equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and the inequality \(i + x - 1 \geq n\) holds; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and the inequality condition remain unchanged.
