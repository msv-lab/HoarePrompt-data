Output State: **`sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `i` is within the range `[0, k-1]`, `sum1`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.**

This means that the value of `sums` has been updated according to the formula provided, while all other variables (`i`, `sum1`, `ans`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a`) retain their previous values from the end of the previous iteration.
