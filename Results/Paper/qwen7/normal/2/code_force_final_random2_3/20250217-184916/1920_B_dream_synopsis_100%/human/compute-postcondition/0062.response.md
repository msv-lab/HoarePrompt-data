Output State: **`i` is within the range [0, k]; `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`; `ans` is now `[sums]`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and reversed; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `i` is not equal to 0; and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Therefore, `ans` is now `[sums]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
