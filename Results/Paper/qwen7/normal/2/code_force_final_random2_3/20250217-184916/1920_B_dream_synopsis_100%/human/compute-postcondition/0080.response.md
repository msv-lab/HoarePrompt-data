Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `i` is within the range `[0, k-1]`.
   - `sums` is updated based on certain conditions.
   - `ans` includes the value of `sums` under specific conditions.
   - `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same.
   - `a` and `sum1` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration**:
   - **Variable `i`**: Since the loop starts from `i = 0` and increments by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - **Variables `n`, `k`, and `x`**: These remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
   - **List `a` and `sum1`**: These remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
   - **Variable `sums`**: The value of `sums` will depend on the conditions specified in the problem. However, since we don't know the exact conditions that led to the current value of `sums`, we cannot predict its exact value for the next iteration. We only know that it will be updated based on the conditions mentioned.
   - **List `ans`**: The value of `ans` will include the updated value of `sums` if the conditions are met.

Given the above points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- **`i`**: It will be `i + 1`.
- **`sums`**: Its value will be updated based on the conditions, but we cannot specify the exact value without knowing the conditions.
- **`ans`**: It will include the updated value of `sums` if the conditions are met.
- **`n`, `k`, and `x`**: They remain unchanged.
- **`a` and `sum1`**: They remain unchanged.

Since we cannot predict the exact value of `sums` without knowing the conditions, we will express it in a general form.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is within the range `[1, k]`, `sums` is updated based on the conditions (cannot be specified exactly), `ans` includes the updated value of `sums` if the conditions are met, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same, and `a` and `sum1` remain unchanged.**
