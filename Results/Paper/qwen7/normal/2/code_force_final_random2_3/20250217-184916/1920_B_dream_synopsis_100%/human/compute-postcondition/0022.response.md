Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.
   - If `i` equals 0, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `ans` contains the value of `sums`.
   - If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` and `ans` contains the value of `sums`.
   - Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]` and `ans` now contains `[sums]`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = k`.

3. **Current Iteration**: 
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Since `i` is 0, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `ans` contains the value of `sums`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - We need to check if `i + x - 1 < n` to determine how `sums` should be updated.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - The values of `sums` and `ans` depend on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`, but since we don't know the exact values of `x` and `n`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `sums` or `ans` without additional information.

Given the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` becomes 1.
- `k` remains unchanged (non-negative integer).
- `sums` and `ans` depend on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`, but their exact values are not specified.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` and `ans` depend on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`**
