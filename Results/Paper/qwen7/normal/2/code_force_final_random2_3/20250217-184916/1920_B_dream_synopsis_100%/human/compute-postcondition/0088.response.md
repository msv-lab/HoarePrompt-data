Postcondition: `i` is within the range [1, k], `sums` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]`. `ans` includes the updated value of `sums`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain the same, and `a` and `sum1` remain unchanged.
