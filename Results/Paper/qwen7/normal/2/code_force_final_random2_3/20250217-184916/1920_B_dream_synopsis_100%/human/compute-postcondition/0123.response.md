Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was previously empty (implied from the initial state), now it contains one element, which is the current value of `sums`. The values of `i`, `x`, `n`, and `sums` remain unchanged except that `sums` has been updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value.
