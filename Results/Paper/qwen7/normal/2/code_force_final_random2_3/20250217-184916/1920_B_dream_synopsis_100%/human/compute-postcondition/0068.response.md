Postcondition: `i` is within the range [0, k]; `sums` is updated to either `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` (if `i + x - 1 < n`) or `sums + a[i - 1]` (if `i + x - 1 >= n`); `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`; `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers obtained from input; `a` is a list of integers obtained from input and reversed; `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the list `a`; `i` is not equal to 0.
