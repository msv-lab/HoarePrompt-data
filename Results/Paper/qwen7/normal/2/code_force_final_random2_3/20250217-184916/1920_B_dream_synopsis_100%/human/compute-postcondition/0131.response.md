Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `ans` is a list, `sums` is `a[0] - 2 * a[x]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` becomes `a[0]`, and `a[i + x - 1]` becomes `a[x]`. Therefore, `sums` is updated to `a[0] - 2 * a[x]`. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
