Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where both rows have '1's in consecutive positions. This can lead to an incorrect lexicographically smallest string and the wrong count of paths.

Consider the following test case:
```
3
3
110
011
```

The expected output should be:
```
101
2
```

However, the program will produce:
```
110
1
```

This happens because the program tries to find the first occurrence of '1' in the first row followed by '0' in the second row, which is not the optimal path. The correct approach would be to always take the minimum value between the two cells at each step, ensuring the lexicographically smallest string is formed.
