Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest binary string that can be formed by moving from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell in a 2Ã—n grid, using only moves to the right or down. Additionally, we need to count the number of such paths that produce this string.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to handle one test case.
   - It correctly reads the input values `n`, `a[0]`, and `a[1]`.
   - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string `s` is flawed. Specifically, the current implementation checks if `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` and constructs `s` based on this condition. This does not ensure the lexicographically smallest string is constructed.
   - The logic for counting the number of paths that yield the smallest string is also incorrect. The current implementation simply counts the longest common prefix between `a[0]` and `s`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest string, we should always take the minimum value (0 or 1) at each step.
   - We need to construct the string by taking the minimum of the corresponding elements in `a[0]` and `a[1]` until we reach the end of one of the strings.
   - The number of paths that yield this string can be calculated by considering how many ways we can reach the end of the constructed string while maintaining the lexicographically smallest path.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided function does not correctly implement the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string or count the number of such paths.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
