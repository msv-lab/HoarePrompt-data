Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the original input integer, the second element is the new input integer, the third element is another input integer, and the fourth element is yet another input integer, `n` is an input integer.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is 2 times as per the given code), the list `a` will contain four elements, each being an input integer provided during the loop's execution. The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `n` retains its initial value as an input integer.
