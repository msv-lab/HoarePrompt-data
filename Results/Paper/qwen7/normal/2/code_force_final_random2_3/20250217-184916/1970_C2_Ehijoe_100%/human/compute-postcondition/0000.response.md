Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is set to the integer value of the second input, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, `leaves` is a deque containing the leaf nodes of the tree, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n indicating the starting node for the first round, and `moves` is a boolean value returned by `func_1` indicating whether Ron can make a move.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `t` respectively. The values of `edges`, `leaves`, `start`, and `moves` remain unchanged from their initial state.
