Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is set to the integer value of the second input, `edges` is now an empty list, `leaves` is a deque containing the leaf nodes of the tree, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n indicating the starting node for the first round, and `moves` is a boolean value returned by `func_1` indicating whether Ron can make a move.**

Explanation: The code initializes `edges` as an empty list, which changes its content from the previous state. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `leaves`, `start`, and `moves`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
