Output State: **`key` is `n`, `nodes` is a dictionary representing the tree structure with at least one key, `leaves` is a list with an additional element `n`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `key`, which is `n`, to the list `leaves`. This means that the list `leaves` now contains all its previous elements plus the new element `n`. The variables `nodes` and `key` remain unchanged from their initial states.
