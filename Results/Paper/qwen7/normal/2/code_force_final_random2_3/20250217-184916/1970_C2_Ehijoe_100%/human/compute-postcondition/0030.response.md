Output State: **`leaves` contains the previous value of `key`; `key` changes to the next key in `nodes`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `key` to the list `leaves`. After appending, `key` is updated to the next key in `nodes`. The precondition that `nodes` must still have keys for the loop to continue remains valid.
