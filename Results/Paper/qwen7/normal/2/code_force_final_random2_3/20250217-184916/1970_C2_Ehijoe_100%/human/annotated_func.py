#State of the program right berfore the function call: nodes is a dictionary where each key is a node (an integer between 1 and n) and the value is a list of integers representing its neighbors, excluding the parent node. start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and parent is an integer representing the parent node of the current node (used for recursion and not modified).

    #State: nodes is a dictionary where each key is a node (an integer between 1 and n) and the value is a list of integers representing its neighbors, excluding the parent node. start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and parent is an integer representing the parent node of the current node (used for recursion and not modified). The length of the neighbors list of start is not 1 or the first neighbor of start is not equal to the parent.

    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `distances` will contain the result of `not func_1(nodes, node, start)` for every node in `nodes[start]` that does not match the `parent` node. The list will include these results in the order they were appended during the loop's iterations.
    return any(distances)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether any element in the list `distances` is True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `nodes` representing a graph, an integer `start` indicating the starting node, and an integer `parent` indicating the parent node. It returns `False` if the starting node has only one neighbor which is the parent node. Otherwise, it recursively checks the neighbors of the starting node (excluding the parent) and constructs a list `distances` containing the negation of the recursive calls' results. Finally, it returns `True` if any element in `distances` is `True`, and `False` otherwise.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, each tuple (u, v) indicates an undirected edge between nodes u and v, leaves is a deque containing the leaf nodes of the tree, start is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n indicating the starting node for the first round, and moves is a boolean value returned by func_1 indicating whether Ron can make a move.

    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed `n-1` times, with `i` being `n-2`. The variable `n` must be at least 2. For each iteration, pairs of integers `(u, v)` are read from input, and `u` and `v` are added to each other's lists in the `nodes` dictionary. As a result, the `nodes` dictionary will represent the entire tree structure with each node pointing to its adjacent nodes.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n-2`, meaning the loop has run `n-1` times. The variable `n` will still be the same as initially provided, which must be at least 2. The `nodes` dictionary will fully represent the tree structure, with each node containing a list of its adjacent nodes based on the inputs provided during the loop iterations.

    #State: All keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1 in their associated list have been appended to the `leaves` list, `start` is an input integer, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`. The current value of `moves` can be either non-zero or falsy.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a tree structure defined by the number of nodes (n), edges, and a starting node (start). It identifies the leaf nodes and uses a helper function (func_1) to determine if Ron can make a move from the starting node. Based on the outcome, it prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
