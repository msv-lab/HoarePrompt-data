Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop will have executed `n-1` times, with `i` being `n-2`. The variable `n` must be at least 2. The `nodes` dictionary will fully represent the tree structure with each node pointing to its adjacent nodes. Additionally, a deque named `leaves` is initialized.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        leaves.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `key` is the key corresponding to `n-1`, `nodes` is a dictionary representing the tree structure with at least one key. If the length of the list associated with `key` in `nodes` is exactly 1, `leaves` is a list containing the element `key`. Otherwise, no change is made to `leaves`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `key` is `n`, `nodes` is a dictionary representing the tree structure with at least one key, and `leaves` is a list. If the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, then `leaves` has an additional element `n`. If the length of `nodes[key]` is not 1, then `leaves` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `key` changes to the next key in `nodes`. If the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, `leaves` contains the previous value of `key`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
