Postcondition: **`y` is equal to `i`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first `i + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the `i-th` element of `a[1]`, and `x` is `i`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts (though the else part does not change the variables).
