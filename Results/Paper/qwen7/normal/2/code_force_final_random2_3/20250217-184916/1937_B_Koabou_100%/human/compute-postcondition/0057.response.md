Output State: **y is equal to x, i is equal to n, and t is equal to -1.**

In this final output state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed, the variable `y` remains equal to `x`, indicating that the last index `i` that satisfied the condition within the loop is the same as `x`. The variable `i` has incremented to `n`, which is the length of the list `a[1]` minus one, since the loop increments `i` until it reaches `x + 2` during its last iteration. The variable `t` is set to `-1` because the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` was found to be true at some point during the loop's execution, and the loop breaks when this condition is met.
