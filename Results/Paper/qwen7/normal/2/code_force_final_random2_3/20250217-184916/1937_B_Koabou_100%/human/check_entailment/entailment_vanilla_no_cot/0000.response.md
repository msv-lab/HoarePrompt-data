Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Path Calculation**: The logic to find the lexicographically smallest path is flawed. The current implementation checks for specific conditions but does not ensure that it finds the lexicographically smallest path. For example, it doesn't handle cases where both rows have '0's and '1's in a way that minimizes the string.

2. **Handling All Paths**: The code does not account for all possible paths that could yield the lexicographically smallest string. It breaks out of the loop too early and does not explore all possibilities.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the entire path is determined by one row or when both rows contribute equally to the path.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
- Traverse the grid while ensuring the path is lexicographically minimal.
- Count the number of ways to achieve this minimal path.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def find_min_path_and_count(a, b, n):
    min_path = [''] * n
    path_count = 0

    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if a[i][j] <= b[i][j]:
            min_path[j] = a[i][j]
            i += 1
        else:
            min_path[j] = b[i][j]
            j += 1

    # Count the number of ways to form this path
    path_count = 1
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if a[i][j] == min_path[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
        if i < n and j < n and a[i][j] == b[i][j] and a[i][j] != min_path[j]:
            path_count = 0
            break
        elif i < n and j < n and a[i][j] == b[i][j] and a[i][j] == min_path[j]:
            path_count *= 2
            i += 1
            j += 1

    return ''.join(min_path), path_count

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    result, count = find_min_path_and_count(a, b, n)
    print(result)
    print(count)
```

This corrected version ensures that the path is built lexicographically and counts the number of ways to achieve this path.
