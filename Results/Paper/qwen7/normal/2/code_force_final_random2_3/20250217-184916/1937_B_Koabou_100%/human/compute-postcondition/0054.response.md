Output State: **`y` is equal to `x`, `i` is `x + 2`, `t` is `-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are reassigned within the given code snippet, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
