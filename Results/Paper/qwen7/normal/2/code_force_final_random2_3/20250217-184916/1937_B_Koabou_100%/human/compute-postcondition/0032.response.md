Postcondition: **`y` is equal to `i`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first `i + 2` elements of `a[0]` and the `i + 1-th` element of `a[1]`, `x` is equal to `i + 1`, and the most internal loop or if statement has been broken out of.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` is true or false, the values of the variables remain as specified in the precondition, with `y` being set to `i` in the if part and the else part being empty (implying no change in the else case).
