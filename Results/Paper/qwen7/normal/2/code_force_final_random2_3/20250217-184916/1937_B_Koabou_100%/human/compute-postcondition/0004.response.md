Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(2):`. The loop variable `_` is used here, but it is typically a placeholder and does not affect the state of other variables. The key variables affected by the loop are `a` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` is a list containing one element which is the input integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for 2 iterations. Since we are considering the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to determine the state after the first iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not change the values of `a` or `n`.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `a`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `n`.

5. **Determine the new state**: Since the loop has not yet completed its second iteration, the state remains the same as at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which is the second iteration) is:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `a` is a list containing one element which is the input integer; `n` is an input integer.**
