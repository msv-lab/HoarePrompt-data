Output State: **`y` is equal to `x`, `i` is `x + 1`, `t` is `-1`, the subarray `a[1][(x + 1):x]` is not defined (or empty)**.

Explanation: The code `t = x - i + 1` updates the value of `t`. Given that `i` is `x + 1`, substituting these values into the equation gives `t = x - (x + 1) + 1 = x - x - 1 + 1 = -1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
