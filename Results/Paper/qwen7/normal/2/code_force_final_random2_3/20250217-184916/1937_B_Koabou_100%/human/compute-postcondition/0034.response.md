Output State: **`y` is equal to `i`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer, `n` must be at least 2, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first `i + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the `i-th` element of `a[1]`, `x` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code `x = i` simply assigns the current value of `i` to `x`. Since `i` was previously defined in the initial state, `x` now holds the same value as `i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
