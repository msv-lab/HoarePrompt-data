Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list containing four elements where the first element is the initial input integer, the second and third elements are the new input integers, and the fourth element is the new input integer, `n` is the length of the concatenated string formed by `a[0]` and `a[1]` minus one, `s` is a list containing the concatenation of the first `x + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the `x-th` element of `a[1]`, `x` is the last index `i` that satisfied either of the conditions in the loop, and `y` is equal to `x`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `n` will be the length of the concatenated string formed by `a[0]` and `a[1]` minus one. The variable `s` will contain the concatenation of the first `x + 1` elements of `a[0]` and the `x-th` element of `a[1]`, where `x` is the last index `i` that satisfied either of the conditions in the loop. The variables `t`, `a`, and `y` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
