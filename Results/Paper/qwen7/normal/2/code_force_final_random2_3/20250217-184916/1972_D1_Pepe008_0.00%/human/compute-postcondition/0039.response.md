Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `i` is `k + 1`, `suma` is `suma + x`, `x` is `(a - (k + 1) * k) // (k + 1)`**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. The value of `x` is given by the formula `(a - (k + 1) * k) // (k + 1)`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a` and `k`, we keep `x` in its formula form. Variables `b` and `i` remain unchanged.
