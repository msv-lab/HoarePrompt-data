Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 3, `i` is 4, `x` is 3, `suma` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\). Given that `i` is 4, the expression simplifies to \((a - 4 \times (4 - 1)) // 4^2 + 1 = (a - 12) // 16 + 1\). Since `a` is `int(info[0])`, the exact value of `a` is not specified, but the calculation remains as \((a - 12) // 16 + 1\). However, without the specific value of `a`, we know `x` is updated based on this formula. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
