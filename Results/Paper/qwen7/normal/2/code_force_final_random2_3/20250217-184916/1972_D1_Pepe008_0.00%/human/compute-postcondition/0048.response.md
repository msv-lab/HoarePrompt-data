To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculation step-by-step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - After the loop executes all iterations, `b` must be at least 3.
   - `i` is equal to `a`.
   - `suma` is the sum of `x` for each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
   - `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.

2. **Understanding the Calculation**:
   - Since `i` is equal to `a`, the expression `a - i * (i - 1)` simplifies to `a - a * (a - 1) = a - a^2 + a = 2a - a^2`.
   - For `x` to be non-zero, `2a - a^2 > 0`, which simplifies to `a(2 - a) > 0`. This inequality holds true for `a = 1` and `a = 2`, but since `b` is at least 3 after the loop, `a` must be greater than 2. Therefore, `2a - a^2 <= 0` for `a >= 3`, meaning `x` will be 0 for all valid `a`.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Since `x` is 0 for all valid `a`, `suma` will also be 0.

4. **Final Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(suma - 1)`.
   - Given that `suma` is 0, `suma - 1` will be `-1`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **-1**
