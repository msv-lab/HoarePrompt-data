Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.

            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1

    #State: Output State: All variables outside the loop, including `T`, `a`, and `b`, retain their final values from the last iteration. Specifically, `t` equals `T-1`, indicating the loop has completed all iterations. `a` and `b` hold the values from the last input `info` provided. The variable `suma` contains the cumulative sum of `x` values calculated over all iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `b`. After the loop completes, `i` would be `b + 1` for the next potential iteration, but since the loop has finished, `i` is no longer tracked individually.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes all its iterations, `T` will be decremented by the number of times the loop ran, `a` and `b` will be the values from the last input, and `suma` will be the total sum of `x` values calculated throughout all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on a specific formula involving \(a\) and \(i\) (where \(i\) ranges from 1 to \(b\)). The final output is the cumulative sum of these calculations for all test cases. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
