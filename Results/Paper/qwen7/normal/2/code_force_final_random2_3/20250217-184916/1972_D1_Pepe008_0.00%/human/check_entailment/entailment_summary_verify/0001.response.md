### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to confirm this conclusion.

#### Problem Statement Recap
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis

1. **Reading Test Cases and Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case individually.
   - It splits the input string to get \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Alternative Logic:**
   - The program iterates over \(i\) from \(1\) to \(b\) (inclusive).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\).
   - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

#### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's compare this logic with the problem statement:

- The provided logic does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is not derived from the problem constraints and does not seem to count the valid pairs correctly.

#### Example Verification

Let's manually verify the logic with the example provided:

- For the test case \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\):
  - Expected output: 14
  - Actual output: 14

While the output matches for this specific example, this does not guarantee correctness for all cases. We need to consider more general cases to ensure the logic is correct.

#### Detailed Example

Consider the test case \(n = 3\), \(m = 5\):

- Expected pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((1, 4)\), \((1, 5)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((3, 1)\), \((3, 3)\)
- Total expected pairs: 10

However, the program's logic will not correctly identify all these pairs. For instance, it will miss pairs like \((2, 4)\) because the formula does not account for the gcd condition properly.

#### Conclusion

Given the detailed analysis and the discrepancy between the expected logic and the provided implementation, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Final Evaluation

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
