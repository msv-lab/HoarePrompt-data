Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `a + b`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x` for each iteration from 1 to `b`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1` for each `i` in the range, and `suma` is updated based on the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `a + b`, since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration. The variable `suma` will be the cumulative sum of `x` for each iteration where the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true. The other variables (`info`, `a`, `b`, `t`) retain their values from the initial or post-condition states after the last iteration.
