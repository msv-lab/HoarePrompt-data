Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, and it is within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for t in range(T):
    info = input().split()
    a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
    """for i in range(1,a+1):
        for j in range(4,b+1):
            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:
                print(i,j)"""
    suma = 0
    for i in range(1, b + 1):
        x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
        if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
            suma += x
    print(suma - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will continue executing until `i` exceeds `b`. After all iterations, `t` remains 0, `T` remains greater than 0, `a` remains `int(info[0])`, and `b` remains its initial value. The variable `suma` will be the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`. `i` will be `b + 1` after the loop completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `b` must be at least 3, `i` is `a`, `suma` is the sum of `x` for each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, and `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is `a + b`, `suma` is the sum of the original `suma` and `x` for each iteration from 1 to `b`, `t` will be `T` at the start of the next iteration, `a` is an integer from the first element of `info`, `b` is an integer from the second element of `info`, `b` must be at least 1, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i + 1` for each `i` in the range, and `suma` is updated based on the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
