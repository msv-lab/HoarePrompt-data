Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks (n), followed by n integers representing the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n); `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This does not affect the values of the elements in the list `arr`. Therefore, the first element of `arr` still represents the number of sticks (n), and the following elements represent the lengths of the sticks. The dictionary `freq` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
