Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks (n), followed by n integers representing the lengths of the sticks. For each unique integer in the list, the function calculates the integer division of its frequency by 4 and returns the sum of these results.**

This means the function takes a list `arr` where the first element indicates the number of sticks, and the subsequent elements represent the lengths of these sticks. It then counts the frequency of each unique stick length, divides each frequency by 4 using integer division, and sums up all these results before returning the total sum.
