Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`n`) and their lengths into a list (`arr`).
3. The function `func_1` processes the list `arr` to count the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary (`freq`).
4. After counting the frequencies, the function calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by summing up the integer division of each frequency by 4 (`v // 4`).

Given the problem statement and the example provided, the function correctly determines the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks. Each polygon requires 3 sides (minimum for a triangle) and the maximum number of polygons is limited by the smallest group of equal sides divided by 3.

Since the function logic matches the problem requirements and the provided example outputs are correct, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
