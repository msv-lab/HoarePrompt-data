Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of regular polygons by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 (since a quadrilateral requires 4 sides). However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of forming polygons with fewer than 4 sides (e.g., triangles).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the maximum number of complete polygons (triangles, squares, etc.) that can be formed. This involves checking the minimum frequency among the possible polygon sides (3, 4, 5, ...).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the frequencies of each stick length
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    
    # Initialize the maximum number of polygons
    max_polygons = 0
    
    # Try to form polygons starting from the smallest possible number of sides (3)
    for sides in range(3, min(freq.keys()) + 1):
        if sides not in freq:
            continue
        # Determine how many complete polygons can be formed with 'sides'
        polygons = freq[sides] // sides
        # Update the maximum number of polygons
        max_polygons = max(max_polygons, polygons)
    
    print(max_polygons)
```

This corrected version iterates over possible numbers of sides for polygons, starting from 3 (the smallest possible polygon), and determines how many complete polygons can be formed with the available sticks. It then updates the maximum number of polygons accordingly.
