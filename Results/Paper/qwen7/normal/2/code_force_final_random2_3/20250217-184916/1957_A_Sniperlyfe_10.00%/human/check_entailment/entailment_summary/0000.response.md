Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating how many regular polygons can be formed from the given sticks. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`n`) and their lengths into the list `arr`. Then, it uses the `func_1` function to calculate the number of regular polygons that can be formed.
3. **Polygon Formation Logic**: In `func_1`, it creates a frequency dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each stick length. It then iterates over the values in `freq` and performs integer division by 4 to determine how many sides (and thus how many polygons) can be formed from each length. Summing these results gives the total number of polygons that can be formed.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program should correctly compute the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks. The execution summary also aligns with this logic, indicating that the program processes each test case appropriately.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
