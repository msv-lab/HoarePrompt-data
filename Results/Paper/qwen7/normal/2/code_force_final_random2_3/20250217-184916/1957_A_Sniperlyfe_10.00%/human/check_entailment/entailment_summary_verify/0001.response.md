### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine how many regular polygons (with equal sides) can be formed using the given sticks such that no stick is reused.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - For each unique stick length, it calculates how many complete polygons (where each polygon has 4 sides) can be formed by performing integer division (`// 4`) on the frequency of that stick length.
   - It then sums up these values to get the total number of polygons that can be formed.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no sticks, the function will return 0.
   - If there are not enough sticks to form even one polygon (i.e., the minimum required sticks for any polygon is 4), the function will return 0.
4. **Input Handling**:
   - The main part of the code correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over each test case and calling `func_1` for each.
5. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which matches the problem's requirement.

However, there is a critical issue with the function `func_1`. The function assumes that the first element of the array `arr` is the number of sticks, but it does not actually use this value in its calculations. Instead, it treats the entire array as a list of stick lengths and calculates the frequency of each stick length without considering the number of sticks explicitly.

This means that the function will not correctly handle cases where the number of sticks is less than 4, because it does not check if the total number of sticks is sufficient to form at least one polygon. Additionally, the function does not account for the fact that each polygon requires exactly 4 sticks of the same length.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
3
5
2 2 2 2 2
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
7
3 3 3 3 3 3 3
```

- For the first test case, the function should return 1 because we can form one square with 4 sticks of length 2.
- For the second test case, the function should return 1 because we can form one square with 4 sticks of length 1.
- For the third test case, the function should return 1 because we can form one triangle with 3 sticks of length 3, but since the function does not check for the minimum requirement of 4 sticks, it incorrectly returns 0.

Therefore, the function is not correctly implementing the logic to ensure that the total number of sticks is sufficient to form at least one polygon.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly handle the edge case where the total number of sticks is insufficient to form even one polygon. Hence, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final:
False
