### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine how many regular polygons (with equal sides) can be formed using the given sticks such that no stick is reused.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - For each unique stick length, it calculates how many complete polygons (where each polygon has 4 sides) can be formed by performing integer division (`// 4`) on the frequency of that stick length.
   - It then sums up these values to get the total number of polygons that can be formed.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no sticks, the function will return 0.
   - If there are not enough sticks to form even one polygon (i.e., the minimum required sticks for any polygon is 4), the function will return 0.
4. **Input Handling**:
   - The main part of the code correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over each test case and calling `func_1` for each.
5. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which matches the problem's requirement.

Given this analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
