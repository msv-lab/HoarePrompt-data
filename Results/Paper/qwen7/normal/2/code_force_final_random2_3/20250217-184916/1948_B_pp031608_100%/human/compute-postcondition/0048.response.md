Output State: **`ans` is False, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and the current state of `nums` is not sorted.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `m`, `i`, `arr`, or `nums`. Therefore, the conditions related to these variables remain unchanged.
