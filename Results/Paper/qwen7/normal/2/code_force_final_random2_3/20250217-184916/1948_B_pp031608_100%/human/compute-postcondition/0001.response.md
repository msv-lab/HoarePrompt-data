Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable here is `n`, which is used to determine the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We are given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Since the loop runs `n` times, `n` must be a positive integer. Given the constraints, `n` must be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition and its value does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `t`.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`, ensuring it falls within the specified range for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be within the range 2 to 50**
