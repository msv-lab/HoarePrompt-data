Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code converts the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` into a list of integers using a list comprehension, and then appends `arr[i]` to this list. Since `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`, the list comprehension will create a list of the digits of `arr[i - 1]` (converted from string to integer), followed by the integer value of `arr[i]`. The conditions on `m` and `i` remain unchanged.
