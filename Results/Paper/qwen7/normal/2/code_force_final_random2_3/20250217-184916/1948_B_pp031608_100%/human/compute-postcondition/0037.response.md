Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `arr[0]` is the final value of the array after all necessary comparisons and updates.
- `ans` is `False` if any pair of consecutive elements were found to violate the sorting condition when their digits were concatenated, otherwise `ans` remains `True`.

Given this, the `print` statement will evaluate the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]`. Since `ans` is `False`, the expression will select the first element of the list `['NO', 'YES']`, which is `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
