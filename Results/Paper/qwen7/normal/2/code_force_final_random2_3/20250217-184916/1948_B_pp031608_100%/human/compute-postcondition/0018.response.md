Output State: **`m` is greater than 1, `i` is `m-2`, `arr[i - 1]` is `arr[m-3]`, `arr[i]` is the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the last digit of `arr[m-3]` concatenated with `nums[0]`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `nums` is updated to be a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` (which is `arr[m-3]`) concatenated with the first element of `nums` (i.e., `nums[0]`). This means `nums` now contains the digits of the number formed by concatenating `arr[m-3]` with `nums[0]`.
- All other variables (`m`, `i`, `arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i]`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
