Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 1.
   - `m` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `m-1`. The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Initial value of `i`**: The variable `i` is already set to 1. For the loop to start, `i` should be within the range specified by `m`.

5. **Initial value of `m`**: Since `m` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 2 (because `i` starts at 1 and the loop runs until `i` is greater than 0).

6. **Other variables**: The variables `arr` and `ans` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `m` must be at least 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be at least 2, `i` is 1**
