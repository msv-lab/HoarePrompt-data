Postcondition: `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is equal to the last digit of `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the digit of `arr[i]`, and `ans` is False, because either `nums` is not sorted, leading to `ans` being set to False and breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no else part which does not change the conditions.
