Output State: **`i` is `m-3`, `m` remains greater than 1, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last character of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, `arr[i-1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `ans` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to the first element of the list `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
