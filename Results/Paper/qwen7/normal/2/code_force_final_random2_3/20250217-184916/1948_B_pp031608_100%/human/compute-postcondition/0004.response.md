Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `ans` is True.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `m` or `arr`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `m` being an input integer and `arr` being a list of integers from the input split by spaces, while adding that `ans` is now `True`.
