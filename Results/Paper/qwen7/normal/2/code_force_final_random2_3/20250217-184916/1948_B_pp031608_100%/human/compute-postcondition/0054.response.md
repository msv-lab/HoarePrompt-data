Postcondition: `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is either equal to `arr[i - 1]` (if `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`), or `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` and `nums` is a list containing the digits of the new `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If the current state of `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False. If `nums` is already sorted, `ans` remains unchanged.
