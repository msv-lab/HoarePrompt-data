Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `m`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `m-1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `m-2`. Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `m-3`.

4. **Check the Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than 0. Given that `i` starts at `m-2` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i > 0`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `m-3`.
   - `m` remains unchanged.
   - `arr[i - 1]` and `arr[i]` will be updated based on the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine their exact values without it.
   - `nums` and `ans` will remain unchanged unless the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met, but since we don't know the exact values of `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]`, we cannot determine if `ans` changes.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**State:**
- `i` is `m-3`.
- `m` remains greater than 1 (since `i` must be greater than 0).

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `m-3`, `m` must be greater than 1**
