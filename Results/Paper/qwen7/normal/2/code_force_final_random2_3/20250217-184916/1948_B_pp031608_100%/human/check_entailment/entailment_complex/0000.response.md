Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Array Processing**: The function processes the array `arr` to check if it can be made non-decreasing. It iterates from the end of the array towards the beginning. For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element. If so, it attempts to sort the concatenated digits of the previous element and the current element. This part of the logic is designed to ensure that the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing order.

3. **Sorting Check**: The function correctly checks if the concatenated digits are sorted. If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that the array cannot be made non-decreasing.

4. **Output**: The function prints "YES" if the array can be made non-decreasing, and "NO" otherwise. This output is consistent with the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases like arrays that are already sorted or arrays where the transformation can make them sorted. The logic seems to cover these scenarios appropriately.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
