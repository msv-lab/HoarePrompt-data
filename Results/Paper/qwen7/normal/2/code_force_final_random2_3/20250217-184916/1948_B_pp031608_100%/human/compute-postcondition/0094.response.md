Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the new value of `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` sets the variable `ans` to `False`. The values of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `arr[i]`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
